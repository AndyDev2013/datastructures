chapter i   prince so genoa and lucca are 
now just family estates of the buonapartes but i warn 
you if you don tell me that this means war 
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors 
perpetrated by that antichrist really believe he is antichrist will 
have nothing more to do with you and you are 
no longer my friend no longer my  slave as 
you call yourself but how do you do i see 
i have frightened you down and tell me all the 
news  it was in july  and the speaker 
was the well anna pavlovna scherer maid of honor and 
favorite of the empress marya fedorovna with these words she 
greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and 
importance who was the first to arrive at her reception 
anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days she 
was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being 
then a new word in st petersburg used only by 
the elite  all her invitations without exception written in 
french and delivered by a scarlet footman that morning ran 
as follows   you have nothing better to do 
count  prince and if the prospect of spending an 
evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i 
shall be very charmed to see you tonight between  
and  scherer   what a virulent attack replied 
the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception 
he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee 
breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and 
a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in 
that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke 
but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to 
a man of importance who had grown old in society 
and at court he went up to anna pavlovna kissed 
her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining 
head and complacently seated himself on the sofa   
of all dear friend tell me how you are set 
your friend mind at rest said he without altering his 
tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference 
and even irony could be discerned   one be 
well while suffering morally can one be calm in times 
like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna 
 are staying the whole evening i hope   
the fete at the english ambassador today is wednesday i 
must put in an appearance there said the prince  
daughter is coming for me to take me there  
 thought today fete had been canceled i confess all 
these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome   they 
had known that you wished it the entertainment would have 
been put off said the prince who like a wound 
clock by force of habit said things he did not 
even wish to be believed   tease well and 
what has been decided about novosiltsev dispatch you know everything 
  can one say about it replied the prince 
in a cold listless tone  has been decided they 
have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i 
believe that we are ready to burn ours  prince 
vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale 
part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty 
years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast 
had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she 
did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order 
not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her 
the subdued smile which though it did not suit her 
faded features always played round her lips expressed as in 
a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect 
which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary 
to correct  in the midst of a conversation on 
political matters anna pavlovna burst out   don speak 
to me of austria perhaps i don understand things but 
austria never has wished and does not wish for war 
she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our 
gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true 
to it that is the one thing i have faith 
in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the 
noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and 
noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill 
his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has 
become more terrible than ever in the person of this 
murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of 
the just one whom i ask you can we rely 
on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot 
understand the emperor alexander loftiness of soul she has refused 
to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks 
some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev 
get none the english have not understood and cannot understand 
the self of our emperor who wants nothing for himself 
but only desires the good of mankind and what have 
they promised nothing and what little they have promised they 
will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is 
invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and 
i don believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz 
either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i 
have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of 
our adored monarch he will save europe  she suddenly 
paused smiling at her own impetuosity   think said 
the prince with a smile  if you had been 
sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured 
the king of prussia consent by assault you are so 
eloquent will you give me a cup of tea  
 a moment a propos she added becoming calm again 
 am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte 
de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the 
rohans one of the best french families he is one 
of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the 
abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has 
been received by the emperor had you heard   
shall be delighted to meet them said the prince  
tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it 
had only just occurred to him though the question he 
was about to ask was the chief motive of his 
visit  it true that the dowager empress wants baron 
funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron 
by all accounts is a poor creature  prince vasili 
wished to obtain this post for his son but others 
were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure 
it for the baron  anna pavlovna almost closed her 
eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had 
a right to criticize what the empress desired or was 
pleased with   funke has been recommended to the 
dowager empress by her sister was all she said in 
a dry and mournful tone  as she named the 
empress anna pavlovna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound 
and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this 
occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added 
that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup 
d and again her face clouded over with sadness  
the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the 
womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna 
pavlovna wished both to rebuke him  daring to speak 
he had done of a man recommended to the empress 
and at the same time to console him so she 
said   about your family do you know that 
since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by 
her they say she is amazingly beautiful  the prince 
bowed to signify his respect and gratitude   often 
think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to 
the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to 
show that political and social topics were ended and the 
time had come for intimate conversation often think how unfairly 
sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate 
given you two such splendid children i don speak of 
anatole your youngest i don like him she added in 
a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows 
 such charming children and really you appreciate them less 
than anyone and so you don deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile   can 
help it said the prince  would have said i 
lack the bump of paternity   joke i mean 
to have a serious talk with you do you know 
i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves  
her face assumed its melancholy expression  was mentioned at 
her majesty and you were pitied  the prince answered 
nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply 
he frowned   would you have me do he 
said at last  know i did all a father 
could for their education and they have both turned out 
fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole 
is an active one that is the only difference between 
them he said this smiling in a way more natural 
and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his 
mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant  
 why are children born to such men as you 
if you were not a father there would be nothing 
i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up 
pensively   am your faithful slave and to you 
alone i can confess that my children are the bane 
of my life it is the cross i have to 
bear that is how i explain it to myself it 
can be helped  he said no more but expressed 
his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna 
meditated   you never thought of marrying your prodigal 
son anatole she asked  say old maids have a 
mania for matchmaking and though i don feel that weakness 
in myself as yet i know a little person who 
is very unhappy with her father she is a relation 
of yours princess mary bolkonskaya  prince vasili did not 
reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting 
a man of the world he indicated by a movement 
of the head that he was considering this information  
 you know he said at last evidently unable to 
check the sad current of his thoughts  anatole is 
costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went 
on after a pause  will it be in five 
years if he goes on like this presently he added 
 what we fathers have to put up with is 
this princess of yours rich   father is very 
rich and stingy he lives in the country he is 
the well prince bolkonski who had to retire from the 
army under the late emperor and was nicknamed  king 
of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a 
bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a 
brother i think you know him he married lise meinen 
lately he is an aide of kutuzov and will be 
here tonight   dear annette said the prince suddenly 
taking anna pavlovna hand and for some reason drawing it 
downwards  that affair for me and i shall always 
be your most devoted slave with an f as a 
village elder of mine writes in his reports she is 
rich and of good family and that all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to 
him he raised the maid of honor hand to his 
lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as 
he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
  said anna pavlovna reflecting  speak to lise 
young bolkonski wife this very evening and perhaps the thing 
can be arranged it shall be on your family behalf 
that i start my apprenticeship as old maid   
   chapter ii   anna pavlovna drawing 
room was gradually filling the highest petersburg society was assembled 
there people differing widely in age and character but alike 
in the social circle to which they belonged prince vasili 
daughter the beautiful helene came to take her father to 
the ambassador entertainment she wore a ball dress and her 
badge as maid of honor the youthful little princess bolkonskaya 
known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg  
was also there she had been married during the previous 
winter and being pregnant did not go to any large 
gatherings but only to small receptions prince vasili son hippolyte 
had come with mortemart whom he introduced the abbe morio 
and many others had also come     
    the most fascinating woman in petersburg 
  to each new arrival anna pavlovna said  
have not yet seen my aunt or  do not 
know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her 
to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon 
in her cap who had come sailing in from another 
room as soon as the guests began to arrive and 
slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt 
anna pavlovna mentioned each one name and then left them 
 each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old 
aunt whom not one of them knew not one of 
them wanted to know and not one of them cared 
about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn 
interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of 
them in the same words about their health and her 
own and the health of her majesty  thank god 
was better today and each visitor though politeness prevented his 
showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of 
relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not 
return to her the whole evening  the young princess 
bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold velvet bag 
her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark 
down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth 
but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially 
charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the 
lower lip as is always the case with a thoroughly 
attractive woman her defect shortness of her upper lip and 
her half mouth to be her own special and peculiar 
form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this 
pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so 
full of life and health and carrying her burden so 
lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked 
at her after being in her company and talking to 
her a little while felt as if they too were 
becoming like her full of life and health all who 
talked to her and at each word saw her bright 
smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought 
that they were in a specially amiable mood that day 
 the little princess went round the table with quick 
short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily 
spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near 
the silver samovar as if all she was doing was 
a pleasure to herself and to all around her  
have brought my work said she in french displaying her 
bag and addressing all present  annette i hope you 
have not played a wicked trick on me she added 
turning to her hostess  wrote that it was to 
be quite a small reception and just see how badly 
i am dressed and she spread out her arms to 
show her short lace dainty gray dress girdled with a 
broad ribbon just below the breast   tranquille lise 
you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna 
pavlovna   know said the princess in the same 
tone of voice and still in french turning to a 
general  husband is deserting me he is going to 
get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is 
for she added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for 
an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the 
beautiful helene   a delightful woman this little princess 
is said prince vasili to anna pavlovna  one of 
the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man 
with close hair spectacles the light breeches fashionable at that 
time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat 
this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count 
bezukhov a well grandee of catherine time who now lay 
dying in moscow the young man had not yet entered 
either the military or civil service as he had only 
just returned from abroad where he had been educated and 
this was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted 
him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy 
in her drawing room but in spite of this lowest 
greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the 
sight of something too large and unsuited to the place 
came over her face when she saw pierre enter though 
he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in 
the room her anxiety could only have reference to the 
clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished 
him from everyone else in that drawing room   
is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and 
visit a poor invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed 
glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her 
 pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round 
as if in search of something on his way to 
the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a 
pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance  anna pavlovna 
alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the aunt 
without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty health 
anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words  
you know the abbe morio he is a most interesting 
man   i have heard of his scheme for 
perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasible 
  think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to 
say something and get away to attend to her duties 
as hostess but pierre now committed a reverse act of 
impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had 
finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak 
to another who wished to get away with his head 
bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining 
his reasons for thinking the abbe plan chimerical   
will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a 
smile  and having got rid of this young man 
who did not know how to behave she resumed her 
duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready 
to help at any point where the conversation might happen 
to flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when 
he has set the hands to work goes round and 
notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one 
that creaks or makes more noise than it should and 
hastens to check the machine or set it in proper 
motion so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching 
now a silent now a too group and by a 
word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady 
proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety 
about pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on 
him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen 
to what was being said there and again when he 
passed to another group whose center was the abbe  
pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna 
pavlovna was the first he had attended in russia he 
knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered 
there and like a child in a toyshop did not 
know which way to look afraid of missing any clever 
conversation that was to be heard seeing the self and 
refined expression on the faces of those present he was 
always expecting to hear something very profound at last he 
came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and 
he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own 
views as young people are fond of doing   
   chapter iii   anna pavlovna reception 
was in full swing the spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly 
on all sides with the exception of the aunt beside 
whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin 
careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant 
society the whole company had settled into three groups one 
chiefly masculine had formed round the abbe another of young 
people was grouped round the beautiful princess helene prince vasili 
daughter and the little princess bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy 
though rather too plump for her age the third group 
was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovna  the vicomte 
was a nice young man with soft features and polished 
manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of 
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle 
in which he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving 
him up as a treat to her guests as a 
clever maitre d serves up as a specially choice delicacy 
a piece of meat that no one who had seen 
it in the kitchen would have cared to eat so 
anna pavlovna served up to her guests first the vicomte 
and then the abbe as peculiarly choice morsels the group 
about mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc 
d the vicomte said that the duc d had perished 
by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons 
for buonaparte hatred of him   yes do tell 
us all about it vicomte said anna pavlovna with a 
pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv 
in the sound of that sentence  nous cela vicomte 
 the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of 
his willingness to comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round 
him inviting everyone to listen to his tale   
vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to of 
the guests  vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she 
to another  evidently he belongs to the best society 
said she to a third and the vicomte was served 
up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous 
style like a well joint of roast beef on a 
hot dish  the vicomte wished to begin his story 
and gave a subtle smile   over here helene 
dear said anna pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who 
was sitting some way off the center of another group 
 the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging 
smile with which she had first entered the room smile 
of a perfectly beautiful woman with a slight rustle of 
her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with a 
gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she 
passed between the men who made way for her not 
looking at any of them but smiling on all as 
if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful 
figure and shapely shoulders back and bosom in the fashion 
of those days were very much exposed she seemed to 
bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she 
moved toward anna pavlovna helene was so lovely that not 
only did she not show any trace of coquetry but 
on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable 
and all too victorious beauty she seemed to wish but 
to be unable to diminish its effect   lovely 
said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his 
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something 
extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon 
him also with her unchanging smile   i doubt 
my ability before such an audience said he smilingly inclining 
his head  the princess rested her bare round arm 
on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary she 
smilingly waited all the time the story was being told 
she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm 
altered in shape by its pressure on the table now 
at her still more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted 
a diamond necklace from time to time she smoothed the 
folds of her dress and whenever the story produced an 
effect she glanced at anna pavlovna at once adopted just 
the expression she saw on the maid of honor face 
and again relapsed into her radiant smile  the little 
princess had also left the tea table and followed helene 
  a moment i get my work now then 
what are you thinking of she went on turning to 
prince hippolyte  me my workbag  there was a 
general movement as the princess smiling and talking merrily to 
everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in 
her seat   i am all right she said 
and asking the vicomte to begin she took up her 
work  prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the 
circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself 
beside her  le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his 
extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by 
the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was 
exceedingly ugly his features were like his sister but while 
in her case everything was lit up by a joyous 
self youthful and constant smile of animation and by the 
wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the 
contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of 
sullen self while his body was thin and weak his 
eyes nose and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant 
wearied grimace and his arms and legs always fell into 
unnatural positions   not going to be a ghost 
story said he sitting down beside the princess and hastily 
adjusting his lorgnette as if without this instrument he could 
not begin to speak   no my dear fellow 
said the astonished narrator shrugging his shoulders   i 
hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tone which 
showed that he only understood the meaning of his words 
after he had uttered them  he spoke with such 
self that his hearers could not be sure whether what 
he said was very witty or very stupid he was 
dressed in a dark dress coat knee breeches of the 
color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it 
shoes and silk stockings  the vicomte told his tale 
very neatly it was an anecdote then current to the 
effect that the duc d had gone secretly to paris 
to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came 
upon bonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and 
that in his presence napoleon happened to fall into one 
of the fainting fits to which he was subject and 
was thus at the duc mercy the latter spared him 
and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death  the 
story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point 
where the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies 
looked agitated   said anna pavlovna with an inquiring 
glance at the little princess   whispered the little 
princess sticking the needle into her work as if to 
testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented 
her from going on with it  the vicomte appreciated 
this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue but 
just then anna pavlovna who had kept a watchful eye 
on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that 
he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe 
so she hurried to the rescue pierre had managed to 
start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of 
power and the latter evidently interested by the young man 
simple eagerness was explaining his pet theory both were talking 
and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why 
anna pavlovna disapproved   means are the balance of 
power in europe and the rights of the people the 
abbe was saying  is only necessary for one powerful 
nation like russia as she is said to be place 
herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for 
its object the maintenance of the balance of power of 
europe and it would save the world   how 
are you to get that balance pierre was beginning  
at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely 
at pierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate 
the italian face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected 
sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women 
  am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the 
wit and culture of the society more especially of the 
feminine society in which i have had the honor of 
being received that i have not yet had time to 
think of the climate said he  not letting the 
abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the more conveniently to 
keep them under observation brought them into the larger circle 
     chapter iv   just 
then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkonski 
the little princess husband he was a very handsome young 
man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about 
him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured 
step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little 
wife it was evident that he not only knew everyone 
in the drawing room but had found them to be 
so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or 
listen to them and among all these faces that he 
found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much 
as that of his pretty wife he turned away from 
her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed 
anna pavlovna hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the 
whole company   are off to the war prince 
said anna pavlovna   kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french 
and stressing the last syllable of the general name like 
a frenchman  been pleased to take me as an 
aide   lise your wife   will go 
to the country   you not ashamed to deprive 
us of your charming wife   said his wife 
addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which 
she spoke to other men  vicomte has been telling 
us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte  
prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre 
who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had 
watched him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and 
took his arm before he looked round prince andrew frowned 
again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm 
but when he saw pierre beaming face he gave him 
an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile   now so 
you too are in the great world said he to 
pierre   knew you would be here replied pierre 
 will come to supper with you may i he 
added in a low voice so as not to disturb 
the vicomte who was continuing his story   impossible 
said prince andrew laughing and pressing pierre hand to show 
that there was no need to ask the question he 
wished to say something more but at that moment prince 
vasili and his daughter got up to go and the 
two young men rose to let them pass   
must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the 
frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly 
way to prevent his rising  unfortunate fete at the 
ambassador deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to 
interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your enchanting 
party said he turning to anna pavlovna  his daughter 
princess helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the 
folds of her dress and the smile shone still more 
radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with 
rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him   
lovely said prince andrew   said pierre  in 
passing prince vasili seized pierre hand and said to anna 
pavlovna  this bear for me he has been staying 
with me a whole month and this is the first 
time i have seen him in society nothing is so 
necessary for a young man as the society of clever 
women  anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre 
in hand she knew his father to be a connection 
of prince vasili the elderly lady who had been sitting 
with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili 
in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had 
assumed had left her kindly and tear face and it 
now expressed only anxiety and fear   about my 
son boris prince said she hurrying after him into the 
anteroom  can remain any longer in petersburg tell me 
what news i may take back to my poor boy 
 although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely 
to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave 
him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand 
that he might not go away   would it 
cost you to say a word to the emperor and 
then he would be transferred to the guards at once 
said she   me princess i am ready to 
do all i can answered prince vasili  it is 
difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise 
you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would 
be the best way  the elderly lady was a 
princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in 
russia but she was poor and having long been out 
of society had lost her former influential connections she had 
now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the 
guards for her only son it was in fact solely 
to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation 
to anna pavlovna reception and had sat listening to the 
vicomte story prince vasili words frightened her an embittered look 
clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment 
then she smiled again and clutched prince vasili arm more 
tightly   to me prince said she  have 
never yet asked you for anything and i never will 
again nor have i ever reminded you of my father 
friendship for you but now i entreat you for god 
sake to do this for my son i shall always 
regard you as a benefactor she added hurriedly  don 
be angry but promise i have asked golitsyn and he 
has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she 
said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes 
  we shall be late said princess helene turning 
her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder 
as she stood waiting by the door  influence in 
society however is a capital which has to be economized 
if it is to last prince vasili knew this and 
having once realized that if he asked on behalf of 
all who begged of him he would soon be unable 
to ask for himself he became chary of using his 
influence but in princess drubetskaya case he felt after her 
second appeal something like qualms of conscience she had reminded 
him of what was quite true he had been indebted 
to her father for the first steps in his career 
moreover he could see by her manners that she was 
one of those women mothers having once made up their 
minds will not rest until they have gained their end 
and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day 
after day and hour after hour and even to make 
scenes this last consideration moved him   dear anna 
mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of 
tone  is almost impossible for me to do what 
you ask but to prove my devotion to you and 
how i respect your father memory i will do the 
impossible son shall be transferred to the guards here is 
my hand on it are you satisfied   dear 
benefactor this is what i expected from you knew your 
kindness he turned to go   a word when 
he has been transferred to the guards she faltered  
are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov recommend boris 
to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest 
and then  prince vasili smiled   i won 
promise that you don know how kutuzov is pestered since 
his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself 
that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him 
all their sons as adjutants   but do promise 
i won let you go my dear benefactor   
said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before 
 shall be late   au revoir good you 
hear her   tomorrow you will speak to the 
emperor   but about kutuzov i don promise  
 promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as he 
went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at 
one time probably came naturally to her but was now 
very ill to her careworn face  apparently she had 
forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all 
the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince 
had gone her face resumed its former cold artificial expression 
she returned to the group where the vicomte was still 
talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it 
would be time to leave her task was accomplished  
    chapter v    what 
do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at 
milan asked anna pavlovna  of the comedy of the 
people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur 
buonaparte and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting 
the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to 
make one head whirl it is as if the whole 
world had gone crazy  prince andrew looked anna pavlovna 
straight in the face with a sarcastic smile   
me la donne gare a qui la touche  they 
say he was very fine when he said that he 
remarked repeating the words in italian  mi l dato 
guai a chi la tocchi      
   god has given it to me let 
him who touches it beware    hope this 
will prove the last drop that will make the glass 
run over anna pavlovna continued  sovereigns will not be 
able to endure this man who is a menace to 
everything   sovereigns i do not speak of russia 
said the vicomte polite but hopeless  sovereigns madame what 
have they done for louis xvii for the queen or 
for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more animated  
believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal 
of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending 
ambassadors to compliment the usurper  and sighing disdainfully he 
again changed his position  prince hippolyte who had been 
gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette 
suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having 
asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of 
arms on the table he explained this to her with 
as much gravity as if she had asked him to 
do it   de gueules engrele de gueules d 
conde said he  the princess listened smiling   
buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer 
the vicomte continued with the air of a man who 
in a matter with which he is better acquainted than 
anyone else does not listen to others but follows the 
current of his own thoughts  will have gone too 
far by intrigues violence exile and executions french society mean 
good french society have been forever destroyed and then  
he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre 
wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him 
but anna pavlovna who had him under observation interrupted  
 emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always 
accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family  
declared that he will leave it to the french people 
themselves to choose their own form of government and i 
believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation 
will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful 
king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist 
emigrant   is doubtful said prince andrew  le 
vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too 
far i think it will be difficult to return to 
the old regime   what i have heard said 
pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation  all the 
aristocracy has already gone over to bonaparte side   
is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without 
looking at pierre  the present time it is difficult 
to know the real state of french public opinion  
 has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic 
smile  it was evident that he did not like 
the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though 
without looking at him   showed them the path 
to glory but they did not follow it prince andrew 
continued after a short silence again quoting napoleon words  
opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not 
know how far he was justified in saying so  
 in the least replied the vicomte  the murder 
of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard 
him as a hero if to some people he went 
on turning to anna pavlovna  ever was a hero 
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr 
more in heaven and one hero less on earth  
before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile 
their appreciation of the vicomte epigram pierre again broke into 
the conversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would 
say something inappropriate she was unable to stop him  
 execution of the duc d declared monsieur pierre  
a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon 
showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on 
himself the whole responsibility of that deed   mon 
dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper   
monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of 
soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her work 
nearer to her   oh exclaimed several voices  
 said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his 
knee with the palm of his hand  the vicomte 
merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his audience 
over his spectacles and continued   say so he 
continued desperately  the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving 
the people to anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revolution 
and quelled it and so for the general good he 
could not stop short for the sake of one man 
life   you come over to the other table 
suggested anna pavlovna  but pierre continued his speech without 
heeding her   cried he becoming more and more 
eager  is great because he rose superior to the 
revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in 
it of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the 
press only for that reason did he obtain power  
 if having obtained power without availing himself of it 
to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful 
king i should have called him a great man remarked 
the vicomte   could not do that the people 
only gave him power that he might rid them of 
the bourbons and because they saw that he was a 
great man the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur 
pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme 
youth and his wish to express all that was in 
his mind   revolution and regicide a grand thing 
well after that but won you come to this other 
table repeated anna pavlovna   contrat social said the 
vicomte with a tolerant smile   am not speaking 
of regicide i am speaking about ideas   ideas 
of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voice 
  were extremes no doubt but they are not 
what is most important what is important are the rights 
of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and 
all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force  
 and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at 
last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish 
his words were  words which have long been discredited 
who does not love liberty and equality even our saviour 
preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become 
happier on the contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has 
destroyed it  prince andrew kept looking with an amused 
smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte 
to their hostess in the first moment of pierre outburst 
anna pavlovna despite her social experience was horror but when 
she saw that pierre sacrilegious words had not exasperated the 
vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to 
stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte 
in a vigorous attack on the orator   my 
dear monsieur pierre said she  do you explain the 
fact of a great man executing a duc even an 
ordinary man who innocent and untried   should like 
said the vicomte  ask how monsieur explains the  
brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle 
and not at all like the conduct of a great 
man   the prisoners he killed in africa that 
was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shoulders  
 a low fellow say what you will remarked prince 
hippolyte  pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at 
them all and smiled his smile was unlike the half 
of other people when he smiled his grave even rather 
gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another childlike kindly even 
rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness  the 
vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw 
clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as 
his words suggested all were silent   do you 
expect him to answer you all at once said prince 
andrew  in the actions of a statesman one has 
to distinguish between his acts as a private person as 
a general and as an emperor so it seems to 
me   yes of course pierre chimed in pleased 
at the arrival of this reinforcement   must admit 
continued prince andrew  napoleon as a man was great 
on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at 
jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague but 
but there are other acts which it is difficult to 
justify  prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone 
down the awkwardness of pierre remarks rose and made a 
sign to his wife that it was time to go 
 suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone 
to attend and asking them all to be seated began 
  was told a charming moscow story today and 
must treat you to it excuse me vicomte must tell 
it in russian or the point will be lost and 
prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian 
as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year 
in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he 
demand their attention to his story   is in 
moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy 
she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very 
big ones that was her taste and she had a 
lady maid also big she said  here prince hippolyte 
paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty   said 
oh yes she said  to the maid  on 
a livery get up behind the carriage and come with 
me while i make some calls  here prince hippolyte 
spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which 
produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among 
them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however smile 
  went suddenly there was a great wind the 
girl lost her hat and her long hair came down 
here he could contain himself no longer and went on 
between gasps of laughter  the whole world knew  
and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why 
he had told it or why it had to be 
told in russian still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated 
prince hippolyte social tact in so agreeably ending pierre unpleasant 
and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up 
into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls 
about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and 
where      chapter vi   
having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests 
began to take their leave  pierre was ungainly stout 
about the average height broad with huge red hands he 
did not know as the saying is how to enter 
a drawing room and still less how to leave one 
that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going 
away besides this he was absent when he rose to 
go he took up instead of his own the general 
three hat and held it pulling at the plume till 
the general asked him to restore it all his absent 
and inability to enter a room and converse in it 
was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression 
anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness 
that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said  
hope to see you again but i also hope you 
will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre  when 
she said this he did not reply and only bowed 
but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless 
perhaps  are opinions but you see what a capital 
good fellow i am and everyone including anna pavlovna felt 
this  prince andrew had gone out into the hall 
and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping 
him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his wife 
chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the 
hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess 
and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass   
in annette or you will catch cold said the little 
princess taking leave of anna pavlovna  is settled she 
added in a low voice  anna pavlovna had already 
managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated 
between anatole and the little princess sister   rely 
on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a 
low tone  to her and let me know how 
her father looks at the matter au revoir she left 
the hall  prince hippolyte approached the little princess and 
bending his face close to her began to whisper something 
 two footmen the princess and his own stood holding 
a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to 
finish they listened to the french sentences which to them 
were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing 
to appear to do so the princess as usual spoke 
smilingly and listened with a laugh   am very 
glad i did not go to the ambassador said prince 
hippolyte  dull it has been a delightful evening has 
it not delightful   say the ball will be 
very good replied the princess drawing up her downy little 
lip  the pretty women in society will be there 
  all for you will not be there not 
all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl 
from the footman whom he even pushed aside he began 
wrapping it round the princess either from awkwardness or intentionally 
 one could have said which after the shawl had 
been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a 
long time as though embracing her  still smiling she 
gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband prince 
andrew eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he 
seem   you ready he asked his wife looking 
past her  prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak 
which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels 
and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following 
the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage 
  au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue 
as well as with his feet  the princess picking 
up her dress was taking her seat in the dark 
carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under 
pretense of helping was in everyone way   me 
sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable 
tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path  
 am expecting you pierre said the same voice but 
gently and affectionately  the postilion started the carriage wheels 
rattled prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the 
porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to 
take home   mon cher said the vicomte having 
seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage  little princess 
is very nice very nice indeed quite french and he 
kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing 
  you know you are a terrible chap for 
all your innocent airs continued the vicomte  pity the 
poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs 
of a monarch  hippolyte spluttered again and amid his 
laughter said  you were saying that the russian ladies 
are not equal to the french one has to know 
how to deal with them   pierre reaching the 
house first went into prince andrew study like one quite 
at home and from habit immediately lay down on the 
sofa took from the shelf the first book that came 
to his hand  was caesar commentaries and resting on 
his elbow began reading it in the middle   
have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite 
ill now said prince andrew as he entered the study 
rubbing his small white hands  pierre turned his whole 
body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager face 
to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand   
abbe is very interesting but he does not see the 
thing in the right light in my opinion perpetual peace 
is possible but do not know how to express it 
not by a balance of political power  it was 
evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract 
conversation   can everywhere say all one thinks mon 
cher well have you at last decided on anything are 
you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked 
prince andrew after a momentary silence  pierre sat up 
on the sofa with his legs tucked under him  
 i don yet know i don like either the 
one or the other   you must decide on 
something your father expects it  pierre at the age 
of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as 
tutor and had remained away till he was twenty when 
he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and 
said to the young man  go to petersburg look 
round and choose your profession i will agree to anything 
here is a letter to prince vasili and here is 
money write to me all about it and i will 
help you in everything pierre had already been choosing a 
career for three months and had not decided on anything 
it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking 
pierre rubbed his forehead   he must be a 
freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had 
met that evening   is all nonsense prince andrew 
again interrupted him  us talk business have you been 
to the horse guards   i have not but 
this is what i have been thinking and wanted to 
tell you there is a war now against napoleon if 
it were a war for freedom i could understand it 
and should be the first to enter the army but 
to help england and austria against the greatest man in 
the world is not right  prince andrew only shrugged 
his shoulders at pierre childish words he put on the 
air of one who finds it impossible to reply to 
such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult 
to give any other answer than the one prince andrew 
gave to this naive question   no one fought 
except on his own conviction there would be no wars 
he said   that would be splendid said pierre 
 prince andrew smiled ironically   likely it would 
be splendid but it will never come about   
why are you going to the war asked pierre  
 for i don know i must besides that i 
am going he paused  am going because the life 
i am leading here does not suit me   
   chapter vii   the rustle of 
a woman dress was heard in the next room prince 
andrew shook himself as if waking up and his face 
assumed the look it had had in anna pavlovna drawing 
room pierre removed his feet from the sofa the princess 
came in she had changed her gown for a house 
dress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew 
rose and politely placed a chair for her   
is it she began as usual in french settling down 
briskly and fussily in the easy chair  is it 
annette never got married how stupid you men all are 
not to have married her excuse me for saying so 
but you have no sense about women what an argumentative 
fellow you are monsieur pierre   i am still 
arguing with your husband i can understand why he wants 
to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess 
with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young 
men in their intercourse with young women  the princess 
started evidently pierre words touched her to the quick  
 that is just what i tell him said she 
 don understand it i don in the least understand 
why men can live without wars how is it that 
we women don want anything of the kind don need 
it now you shall judge between us i always tell 
him here he is uncle aide a most brilliant position 
he is so well known so much appreciated by everyone 
the other day at the apraksins i heard a lady 
asking  that the famous prince andrew i did indeed 
she laughed  is so well received everywhere he might 
easily become aide to the emperor you know the emperor 
spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking 
of how to arrange it what do you think  
pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did 
not like the conversation gave no reply   are 
you starting he asked   don speak of his 
going don i won hear it spoken of said the 
princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she 
had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which 
was so plainly ill to the family circle of which 
pierre was almost a member  when i remembered that 
all these delightful associations must be broken off and then 
you know andre  looked significantly at her husband  
afraid i afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down 
her back  her husband looked at her as if 
surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was 
in the room and addressed her in a tone of 
frigid politeness   is it you are afraid of 
lise i don understand said he   what egotists 
men all are all all egotists just for a whim 
of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me 
and locks me up alone in the country   
my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently  
 all the same without my friends and he expects 
me not to be afraid  her tone was now 
querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a 
joyful but an animal squirrel expression she paused as if 
she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before 
pierre though the gist of the matter lay in that 
  still can understand what you are afraid of 
said prince andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his 
wife  the princess blushed and raised her arms with 
a gesture of despair   andrew i must say 
you have changed oh how you have   doctor 
tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew 
 had better go  the princess said nothing but 
suddenly her short downy lip quivered prince andrew rose shrugged 
his shoulders and walked about the room  pierre looked 
over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him and 
now at her moved as if about to rise too 
but changed his mind   should i mind monsieur 
pierre being here exclaimed the little princess suddenly her pretty 
face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace  
have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have 
changed so to me what have i done to you 
you are going to the war and have no pity 
for me why is it   was all prince 
andrew said but that one word expressed an entreaty a 
threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret 
her words but she went on hurriedly   treat 
me like an invalid or a child i see it 
all did you behave like that six months ago  
 i beg you to desist said prince andrew still 
more emphatically  pierre who had been growing more and 
more agitated as he listened to all this rose and 
approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the sight 
of tears and was ready to cry himself   
yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure 
you i myself have experienced and so because no excuse 
me an outsider is out of place here no don 
distress yourself good  prince andrew caught him by the 
hand   wait pierre the princess is too kind 
to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending 
the evening with you   he thinks only of 
himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears  
 said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the 
pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted  suddenly the 
angry squirrel expression of the princess pretty face changed into 
a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes 
glanced askance at her husband face and her own assumed 
the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly 
but feebly wags its drooping tail   dieu mon 
dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand 
she went up to her husband and kissed him on 
the forehead   night lise said he rising and 
courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to 
a stranger      chapter viii  
 the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking 
pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his 
forehead with his small hand   us go and 
have supper he said with a sigh going to the 
door  they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious 
dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver 
china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in 
the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince 
andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a 
look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before 
seen on his face began to talk one who has 
long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to 
speak out   never marry my dear fellow that 
my advice never marry till you can say to yourself 
that you have done all you are capable of and 
until you have ceased to love the woman of your 
choice and have seen her plainly as she is or 
else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry 
when you are old and good for nothing all that 
is good and noble in you will be lost it 
will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes don 
look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting 
anything from yourself in the future you will feel at 
every step that for you all is ended all is 
closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged 
side by side with a court lackey and an idiot 
but what the good and he waved his arm  
pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem 
different and the good expression still more apparent and gazed 
at his friend in amazement   wife continued prince 
andrew  an excellent woman one of those rare women 
with whom a man honor is safe but o god 
what would i not give now to be unmarried you 
are the first and only one to whom i mention 
this because i like you  as he said this 
prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who 
had lolled in anna pavlovna easy chairs and with half 
eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle 
of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement 
his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed 
extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it was evident that 
the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more 
impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation 
  don understand why i say this he continued 
 it is the whole story of life you talk 
of bonaparte and his career said he  pierre had 
not mentioned bonaparte  bonaparte when he worked went step 
by step toward his goal he was free he had 
nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it 
but tie yourself up with a woman and like a 
chained convict you lose all freedom and all you have 
of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments 
you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality 
are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am 
now going to the war the greatest war there ever 
was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing 
i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued 
prince andrew  at anna pavlovna they listen to me 
and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist 
and those women if you only knew what those society 
women are and women in general my father is right 
selfish vain stupid trivial in everything what women are when 
you see them in their true colors when you meet 
them in society it seems as if there were something 
in them but there nothing nothing nothing no don marry 
my dear fellow don marry concluded prince andrew   
seems funny to me said pierre  you you should 
consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you 
have everything before you everything and you  he did 
not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly 
he thought of his friend and how much he expected 
of him in the future   can he talk 
like that thought pierre he considered his friend a model 
of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree 
just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be 
best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished 
at prince andrew calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary 
memory his extensive reading  had read everything knew everything 
and had an opinion about everything but above all at 
his capacity for work and study and if pierre was 
often struck by andrew lack of capacity for philosophical meditation 
 which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even 
this not as a defect but as a sign of 
strength  even in the best most friendly and simplest 
relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as 
grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly 
  part is played out said prince andrew  
the use of talking about me let us talk about 
you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring 
thoughts  that smile was immediately reflected on pierre face 
  what is there to say about me said 
pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile  
am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and 
it was plain that he had made a great effort 
to say this  a name and without means and 
it really but he did not say what  really 
was  the present i am free and am all 
right only i haven the least idea what i am 
to do i wanted to consult you seriously  prince 
andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance and affectionate 
as it was a sense of his own superiority  
 am fond of you especially as you are the 
one live man among our whole set yes you all 
right choose what you will it all the same you 
be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting 
those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits 
you so badly this debauchery dissipation and the rest of 
it   would you have my dear fellow answered 
pierre shrugging his shoulders  my dear fellow women  
 don understand it replied prince andrew  who are 
comme il faut that a different matter but the kuragins 
set of women  and wine i don understand  
pierre was staying at prince vasili kuragin and sharing the 
dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they 
were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrew 
sister   you know said pierre as if suddenly 
struck by a happy thought  i have long been 
thinking of it leading such a life i can decide 
or think properly about anything one head aches and one 
spends all one money he asked me for tonight but 
i won go   give me your word of 
honor not to go   my honor   
   chapter ix   it was past 
one o when pierre left his friend it was a 
cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending 
to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to 
the house the more he felt the impossibility of going 
to sleep on such a night it was light enough 
to see a long way in the deserted street and 
it seemed more like morning or evening than night on 
the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the 
usual set for cards that evening after which there was 
generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind 
pierre was very fond of   should like to 
go to kuragin thought he  but he immediately recalled 
his promise to prince andrew not to go there then 
as happens to people of weak character he desired so 
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so 
accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately 
occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was 
of no account because before he gave it he had 
already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering  
thought he  such  of honor are conventional things 
with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by 
tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may 
happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all 
the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort 
nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to kuragin 
 reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks 
in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended 
the stairs and went in at the open door there 
was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and 
overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol 
and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance  
cards and supper were over but the visitors had not 
yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the 
first room in which were the remains of supper a 
footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the 
sly what was left in the glasses from the third 
room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices 
the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight 
or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open 
window three others were romping with a young bear one 
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him 
at the others   bet a hundred on stevens 
shouted one   no holding on cried another  
 bet on dolokhov cried a third  you part 
our hands   leave bruin alone here a bet 
on   one draught or he loses shouted a 
fourth   bring a bottle shouted the host a 
tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the 
group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt 
unfastened in front  a bit you fellows here is 
petya good man cried he addressing pierre  another voice 
from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes 
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober 
ring cried from the window  here part the bets 
this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a 
notorious gambler and duelist who was living with anatole pierre 
smiled looking about him merrily   don understand what 
it all about   a bit he is not 
drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a glass 
from the table he went up to pierre   
of all you must drink  pierre drank one glass 
after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy 
guests who were again crowding round the window and listening 
to their chatter anatole kept on refilling pierre glass while 
explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval 
officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting 
on the outer ledge of the third floor window with 
his legs hanging out   on you must drink 
it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass  
i won let you go   i won said 
pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the 
window  dolokhov was holding the englishman hand and clearly 
and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself 
particularly to anatole and pierre  dolokhov was of medium 
height with curly hair and light eyes he was about 
twenty like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so 
that his mouth the most striking feature of his face 
was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably 
finely curved the middle of the upper lip formed a 
sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one 
and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the 
two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute 
insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made 
it impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a 
man of small means and no connections yet though anatole 
spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him 
and had placed himself on such a footing that all 
who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than 
they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly 
always won however much he drank he never lost his 
clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious 
among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg  the bottle 
of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone 
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out 
by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by 
the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around  anatole 
with his swaggering air strode up to the window he 
wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged 
at the frame but could not move it he smashed 
a pane   have a try hercules said he 
turning to pierre  pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and 
wrenched the oak frame out with a crash   
it right out or they think i holding on said 
dolokhov   the englishman bragging eh is it all 
right said anatole   said pierre looking at dolokhov 
who with a bottle of rum in his hand was 
approaching the window from which the light of the sky 
the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible 
 dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand 
jumped onto the window sill  cried he standing there 
and addressing those in the room all were silent  
 bet fifty imperials spoke french that the englishman might 
understand him but he did not speak it very well 
bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it 
a hundred added he addressing the englishman   fifty 
replied the latter   right fifty imperials that i 
will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it 
from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot 
 stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the 
window  without holding on to anything is that right 
  right said the englishman  anatole turned to 
the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons 
of his coat and looking down at him englishman was 
short repeating the terms of the wager to him in 
english   cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on 
the window sill to attract attention  a bit kuragin 
listen if anyone else does the same i will pay 
him a hundred imperials do you understand  the englishman 
nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept 
this challenge or not anatole did not release him and 
though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole 
went on translating dolokhov words into english a thin young 
lad an hussar of the life guards who had been 
losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over 
and looked down   oh oh he muttered looking 
down from the window at the stones of the pavement 
  up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the 
window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping 
over his spurs  placing the bottle on the window 
sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully 
and slowly through the window and lowered his legs pressing 
against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on 
his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the 
right and then to the left and took up the 
bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the 
window sill though it was already quite light dolokhov back 
in his white shirt and his curly head were lit 
up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the 
englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one man 
older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a 
scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of 
dolokhov shirt   say this is folly he be 
killed said this more sensible man  anatole stopped him 
  touch him you startle him and then he 
be killed eh what then eh  dolokhov turned round 
and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on 
his seat   anyone comes meddling again said he 
emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips  
will throw him down there now then  saying this 
he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle 
and lifted it to his lips threw back his head 
and raised his free hand to balance himself one of 
the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken 
glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from 
the window and from dolokhov back anatole stood erect with 
staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his 
lips the man who had wished to stop the affair 
ran to a corner of the room and threw himself 
on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre 
hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to 
fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all 
were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov 
still sat in the same position only his head was 
thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt 
collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher 
and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was 
emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting 
yet further back  is it so long thought pierre 
it seemed to him that more than half an hour 
had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his 
spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to 
cause his whole body to slip as he sat on 
the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head 
and arm wavered still more with the strain one hand 
moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained 
from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought 
he would never open them again suddenly he was aware 
of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was 
standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant 
face   empty  he threw the bottle to 
the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he 
smelt strongly of rum   done fine fellow there 
a bet for you devil take you came from different 
sides  the englishman took out his purse and began 
counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not 
speak pierre jumped upon the window sill   who 
wishes to bet with me i do the same thing 
he suddenly cried  without a bet there tell them 
to bring me a bottle i do it bring a 
bottle   him do it let him do it 
said dolokhov smiling   next have you gone mad 
no one would let you why you go giddy even 
on a staircase exclaimed several voices   drink it 
let have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the 
table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to 
climb out of the window  they seized him by 
his arms but he was so strong that everyone who 
touched him was sent flying   you never manage 
him that way said anatole  a bit and i 
get round him listen i take your bet tomorrow but 
now we are all going to    on 
then cried pierre  on and we take bruin with 
us  and he caught the bear took it in 
his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing 
round the room with it      
chapter x   prince vasili kept the promise he 
had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him 
on behalf of her only son boris on the evening 
of anna pavlovna soiree the matter was mentioned to the 
emperor an exception made and boris transferred into the regiment 
of semenov guards with the rank of cornet he received 
however no appointment to kutuzov staff despite all anna mikhaylovna 
endeavors and entreaties soon after anna pavlovna reception anna mikhaylovna 
returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations 
the rostovs with whom she stayed when in the town 
and where her darling bory who had only just entered 
a regiment of the line and was being at once 
transferred to the guards as a cornet had been educated 
from childhood and lived for years at a time the 
guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august 
and her son who had remained in moscow for his 
equipment was to join them on the march to radzivilov 
 it was st natalia day and the name day 
of two of the rostovs mother and the youngest daughter 
named nataly ever since the morning carriages with six horses 
had been coming and going continually bringing visitors to the 
countess rostova big house on the povarskaya so well known 
to all moscow the countess herself and her handsome eldest 
daughter were in the drawing with the visitors who came 
to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relays 
 the countess was a woman of about forty with 
a thin oriental type of face evidently worn out with 
childbearing had had twelve a languor of motion and speech 
resulting from weakness gave her a distinguished air which inspired 
respect princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya who as a member of 
the household was also seated in the drawing room helped 
to receive and entertain the visitors the young people were 
in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary 
to take part in receiving the visitors the count met 
the guests and saw them off inviting them all to 
dinner   am very very grateful to you mon 
cher or  chere called everyone without exception and without 
the slightest variation in his tone  dear whether they 
were above or below him in rank thank you for 
myself and for our two dear ones whose name day 
we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or 
i shall be offended ma chere on behalf of the 
whole family i beg you to come mon cher these 
words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and 
with the same expression on his full cheerful clean face 
the same firm pressure of the hand and the same 
quick repeated bows as soon as he had seen a 
visitor off he returned to one of those who were 
still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him 
or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting 
his hands on his knees with the air of a 
man who enjoys life and knows how to live he 
swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the 
weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian 
and sometimes in very bad but self french then again 
like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of 
duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking 
his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked 
them to dinner sometimes on his way back from the 
anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into 
the large marble dining hall where tables were being set 
out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who 
were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding 
damask table linen he would call dmitri vasilevich a man 
of good family and the manager of all his affairs 
and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would 
say  dmitri you see that things are all as 
they should be that right the great thing is the 
serving that it and with a complacent sigh he would 
return to the drawing room   lvovna karagina and 
her daughter announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass 
voice entering the drawing room the countess reflected a moment 
and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her 
husband portrait on it   quite worn out by 
these callers however i see her and no more she 
is so affected ask her in she said to the 
footman in a sad voice as if saying  well 
finish me off  a tall stout and proud woman 
with a round smiling daughter entered the drawing room their 
dresses rustling   countess what an age she has 
been laid up poor child at the razumovski ball and 
countess apraksina i was so delighted came the sounds of 
animated feminine voices interrupting one another and mingling with the 
rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs then one 
of those conversations began which last out until at the 
first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses 
and say  am so delighted mamma health and countess 
apraksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put 
on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation was 
on the chief topic of the day the illness of 
the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherine day count bezukhov 
and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had 
behaved so improperly at anna pavlovna reception   am 
so sorry for the poor count said the visitor  
is in such bad health and now this vexation about 
his son is enough to kill him   is 
that asked the countess as if she did not know 
what the visitor alluded to though she had already heard 
about the cause of count bezukhov distress some fifteen times 
  what comes of a modern education exclaimed the 
visitor  seems that while he was abroad this young 
man was allowed to do as he liked now in 
petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things 
that he has been expelled by the police   
don say so replied the countess   chose his 
friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna  vasili son he and 
a certain dolokhov have it is said been up to 
heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer 
for it dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and 
bezukhov son sent back to moscow anatole kuragin father managed 
somehow to get his son affair hushed up but even 
he was ordered out of petersburg   what have 
they been up to asked the countess   are 
regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor  is a 
son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but 
there just fancy those three got hold of a bear 
somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with 
it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere 
and what did the young men do they tied a 
policeman and the bear back to back and put the 
bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear 
swimming about with the policeman on his back   
a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear 
shouted the count dying with laughter   how dreadful 
how can you laugh at it count  yet the 
ladies themselves could not help laughing   was all 
they could do to rescue the poor man continued the 
visitor  to think it is cyril vladimirovich bezukhov son 
who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was 
said to be so well educated and clever this is 
all that his foreign education has done for him i 
hope that here in moscow no one will receive him 
in spite of his money they wanted to introduce him 
to me but i quite declined i have my daughters 
to consider   do you say this young man 
is so rich asked the countess turning away from the 
girls who at once assumed an air of inattention  
children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate 
 the visitor made a gesture with her hand  
 should think he has a score of them  
princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to 
show her connections and knowledge of what went on in 
society   fact of the matter is said she 
significantly and also in a half whisper  knows count 
cyril reputation he has lost count of his children but 
this pierre was his favorite   handsome the old 
man still was only a year ago remarked the countess 
 have never seen a handsomer man   is 
very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna  as i 
was saying prince vasili is the next heir through his 
wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked 
after his education and wrote to the emperor about him 
so that in the case of his death he is 
so ill that he may die at any moment and 
dr lorrain has come from petersburg one knows who will 
inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasili forty thousand 
serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very 
well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich 
is my mother second cousin he also my bory godfather 
she added as if she attached no importance at all 
to the fact   vasili arrived in moscow yesterday 
i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked 
the visitor   but between ourselves said the princess 
 is a pretext the fact is he has come 
to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he is 
  do you know my dear that was a 
capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder 
visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies 
 can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman 
cut  and as he waved his arms to impersonate 
the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep 
ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well 
and in particular drinks well  do come and dine 
with us he said      chapter 
xi   silence ensued the countess looked at her 
callers smiling affably but not concealing the fact that she 
would not be distressed if they now rose and took 
their leave the visitor daughter was already smoothing down her 
dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly 
from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys 
and girls running to the door and the noise of 
a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen hiding 
something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted 
in and stopped short in the middle of the room 
it was evident that she had not intended her flight 
to bring her so far behind her in the doorway 
appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer 
of the guards a girl of fifteen and a plump 
rosy boy in a short jacket  the count jumped 
up and swaying from side to side spread his arms 
wide and threw them round the little girl who had 
run in   here she is he exclaimed laughing 
 pet whose name day it is my dear pet 
  chere there is a time for everything said 
the countess with feigned severity  spoil her ilya she 
added turning to her husband   do you do 
my dear i wish you many happy returns of your 
name day said the visitor  a charming child she 
added addressing the mother  this black wide girl not 
pretty but full of life childish bare shoulders which after 
her run heaved and shook her bodice with black curls 
tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lace drawers 
and feet in low slippers just at that charming age 
when a girl is no longer a child though the 
child is not yet a young woman escaping from her 
father she ran to hide her flushed face in the 
lace of her mother mantilla paying the least attention to 
her severe remark began to laugh she laughed and in 
fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she 
produced from the folds of her frock   you 
see my doll mimi you see was all natasha managed 
to utter  her everything seemed funny she leaned against 
her mother and burst into such a loud ringing fit 
of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help 
joining in   then go away and take your 
monstrosity with you said the mother pushing away her daughter 
with pretended sternness and turning to the visitor she added 
 is my youngest girl  natasha raising her face 
for a moment from her mother mantilla glanced up at 
her through tears of laughter and again hid her face 
 the visitor compelled to look on at this family 
scene thought it necessary to take some part in it 
  me my dear said she to natasha  
mimi a relation of yours a daughter i suppose  
natasha did not like the visitor tone of condescension to 
childish things she did not reply but looked at her 
seriously  meanwhile the younger generation boris the officer anna 
mikhaylovna son nicholas the undergraduate the count eldest son sonya 
the count fifteen niece and little petya his youngest boy 
had all settled down in the drawing room and were 
obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the 
excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces evidently 
in the back rooms from which they had dashed out 
so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing than the 
drawing talk of society scandals the weather and countess apraksina 
now and then they glanced at one another hardly able 
to suppress their laughter  the two young men the 
student and the officer friends from childhood were of the 
same age and both handsome fellows though not alike boris 
was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face 
had regular delicate features nicholas was short with curly hair 
and an open expression dark hairs were already showing on 
his upper lip and his whole face expressed impetuosity and 
enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room he 
evidently tried to find something to say but failed boris 
on the contrary at once found his footing and related 
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi 
when she was still quite a young lady before her 
nose was broken how she had aged during the five 
years he had known her and how her head had 
cracked right across the skull having said this he glanced 
at natasha she turned away from him and glanced at 
her younger brother who was screwing up his eyes and 
shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to control herself any 
longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as 
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her boris 
did not laugh   were meaning to go out 
weren you mamma do you want the carriage he asked 
his mother with a smile   yes go and 
tell them to get it ready she answered returning his 
smile  boris quietly left the room and went in 
search of natasha the plump boy ran after them angrily 
as if vexed that their program had been disturbed  
    chapter xii   the only 
young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the 
young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter  was 
four years older than her sister and behaved already like 
a grown person were nicholas and sonya the niece sonya 
was a slender little brunette with a tender look in 
her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black 
plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint 
in her complexion and especially in the color of her 
slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck by the 
grace of her movements by the softness and flexibility of 
her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve 
of manner she reminded one of a pretty half kitten 
which promises to become a beautiful little cat she evidently 
considered it proper to show an interest in the general 
conversation by smiling but in spite of herself her eyes 
under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was 
going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration 
that her smile could not for a single instant impose 
upon anyone and it was clear that the kitten had 
settled down only to spring up with more energy and 
again play with her cousin as soon as they too 
could like natasha and boris escape from the drawing room 
  yes my dear said the count addressing the 
visitor and pointing to nicholas  friend boris has become 
an officer and so for friendship sake he is leaving 
the university and me his old father and entering the 
military service my dear and there was a place and 
everything waiting for him in the archives department isn that 
friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone   
they say that war has been declared replied the visitor 
  been saying so a long while said the 
count  they say so again and again and that 
will be the end of it my dear there friendship 
for you he repeated  joining the hussars  the 
visitor not knowing what to say shook her head  
 not at all from friendship declared nicholas flaring up 
and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion  
is not from friendship at all i simply feel that 
the army is my vocation  he glanced at his 
cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both 
regarding him with a smile of approbation   the 
colonel of the pavlograd hussars is dining with us today 
he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas 
back with him it can be helped said the count 
shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that 
evidently distressed him   have already told you papa 
said his son  if you don wish to let 
me go i stay but i know i am no 
use anywhere except in the army i am not a 
diplomat or a government clerk don know how to hide 
what i feel as he spoke he kept glancing with 
the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sonya and the 
young lady visitor  the little kitten feasting her eyes 
on him seemed ready at any moment to start her 
gambols again and display her kittenish nature   right 
all right said the old count  always flares up 
this buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think 
of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor 
well well god grant it he added not noticing his 
visitor sarcastic smile  the elders began talking about bonaparte 
julie karagina turned to young rostov   a pity 
you weren at the arkharovs on thursday it was so 
dull without you said she giving him a tender smile 
 the young man flattered sat down nearer to her 
with a coquettish smile and engaged the smiling julie in 
a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary 
smile had stabbed the heart of sonya who blushed and 
smiled unnaturally in the midst of his talk he glanced 
round at her she gave him a passionately angry glance 
and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the 
artificial smile on her lips she got up and left 
the room all nicholas animation vanished he waited for the 
first pause in the conversation and then with a distressed 
face left the room to find sonya   plainly 
all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves 
said anna mikhaylovna pointing to nicholas as he went out 
 voisinage  she added      
   cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood   
 said the countess when the brightness these young people 
had brought into the room had vanished and as if 
answering a question no one had put but which was 
always in her mind  how much suffering how much 
anxiety one has had to go through that we might 
rejoice in them now and yet really the anxiety is 
greater now than the joy one is always always anxious 
especially just at this age so dangerous both for girls 
and boys   all depends on the bringing up 
remarked the visitor   you quite right continued the 
countess  now i have always thank god been my 
children friend and had their full confidence said she repeating 
the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their 
children have no secrets from them  know i shall 
always be my daughters first confidante and that if nicholas 
with his impulsive nature does get into mischief  boy 
can help it he will all the same never be 
like those petersburg young men   they are splendid 
splendid youngsters chimed in the count who always solved questions 
that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was 
splendid  fancy wants to be an hussar what one 
to do my dear   a charming creature your 
younger girl is said the visitor  little volcano  
 a regular volcano said the count  after me 
and what a voice she has though she my daughter 
i tell the truth when i say she be a 
singer a second salomoni we have engaged an italian to 
give her lessons   she too young i have 
heard that it harms the voice to train it at 
that age   no not at all too young 
replied the count  our mothers used to be married 
at twelve or thirteen   she in love with 
boris already just fancy said the countess with a gentle 
smile looking at boris and went on evidently concerned with 
a thought that always occupied her  you see if 
i were to be severe with her and to forbid 
it goodness knows what they might be up to on 
the sly  meant that they would be kissing  
as it is i know every word she utters she 
will come running to me of her own accord in 
the evening and tell me everything perhaps i spoil her 
but really that seems the best plan with her elder 
sister i was stricter   i was brought up 
quite differently remarked the handsome elder daughter countess vera with 
a smile  but the smile did not enhance vera 
beauty as smiles generally do on the contrary it gave 
her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant expression vera was good 
not at all stupid quick at learning was well brought 
up and had a pleasant voice what she said was 
true and appropriate yet strange to say everyone visitors and 
countess alike to look at her as if wondering why 
she had said it and they all felt awkward  
 are always too clever with their eldest children and 
try to make something exceptional of them said the visitor 
  the good of denying it my dear our 
dear countess was too clever with vera said the count 
 what of that she turned out splendidly all the 
same he added winking at vera  the guests got 
up and took their leave promising to return to dinner 
  manners i thought they would never go said 
the countess when she had seen her guests out  
    chapter xiii   when natasha 
ran out of the drawing room she only went as 
far as the conservatory there she paused and stood listening 
to the conversation in the drawing room waiting for boris 
to come out she was already growing impatient and stamped 
her foot ready to cry at his not coming at 
once when she heard the young man discreet steps approaching 
neither quickly nor slowly at this natasha dashed swiftly among 
the flower tubs and hid there  boris paused in 
the middle of the room looked round brushed a little 
dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up 
to a mirror examined his handsome face natasha very still 
peered out from her ambush waiting to see what he 
would do he stood a little while before the glass 
smiled and walked toward the other door natasha was about 
to call him but changed her mind  him look 
for me thought she hardly had boris gone than sonya 
flushed in tears and muttering angrily came in at the 
other door natasha checked her first impulse to run out 
to her and remained in her hiding place watching under 
an invisible cap see what went on in the world 
she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure sonya muttering 
to herself kept looking round toward the drawing door it 
opened and nicholas came in   what is the 
matter with you how can you said he running up 
to her   nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed 
sonya   i know what it is   
if you do so much the better and you can 
go back to her   look here how can 
you torture me and yourself like that for a mere 
fancy said nicholas taking her hand  sonya did not 
pull it away and left off crying natasha not stirring 
and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes 
 will happen now thought she   what is 
anyone in the world to me you alone are everything 
said nicholas  i will prove it to you  
 don like you to talk like that   
then i won only forgive me sonya he drew her 
to him and kissed her   how nice thought 
natasha and when sonya and nicholas had gone out of 
the conservatory she followed and called boris to her  
 come here said she with a sly and significant 
look  have something to tell you here here and 
she led him into the conservatory to the place among 
the tubs where she had been hiding  boris followed 
her smiling   is the something asked he  
she grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she 
had thrown down on one of the tubs picked it 
up   the doll said she  boris looked 
attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not 
reply   you want to well then come here 
said she and went further in among the plants and 
threw down the doll  closer she whispered  she 
caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look 
of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face  
 me would you like to kiss me she whispered 
almost inaudibly glancing up at him from under her brows 
smiling and almost crying from excitement  boris blushed  
 funny you are he said bending down to her 
and blushing still more but he waited and did nothing 
 suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be 
higher than he embraced him so that both her slender 
bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing back 
her hair kissed him full on the lips  then 
she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side 
of the tubs and stood hanging her head   
he said  know that i love you but  
 are in love with me natasha broke in  
 i am but please don let us do like 
that in another four years then i will ask for 
your hand  natasha considered   fourteen fifteen sixteen 
she counted on her slender little fingers  right then 
it settled  a smile of joy and satisfaction lit 
up her eager face   replied boris   
said the little girl  death itself  she took 
his arm and with a happy face went with him 
into the adjoining sitting room      
chapter xiv   after receiving her visitors the countess 
was so tired that she gave orders to admit no 
more but the porter was told to be sure to 
invite to dinner all who came  congratulate the countess 
wished to have a tete talk with the friend of 
her childhood princess anna mikhaylovna whom she had not seen 
properly since she returned from petersburg anna mikhaylovna with her 
tear but pleasant face drew her chair nearer to that 
of the countess   you i will be quite 
frank said anna mikhaylovna  are not many left of 
us old friends that why i so value your friendship 
 anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused the countess 
pressed her friend hand   she said to her 
eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite  is 
it you have so little tact don you see you 
are not wanted here go to the other girls or 
 the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem 
at all hurt   you had told me sooner 
mamma i would have gone she replied as she rose 
to go to her own room  but as she 
passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one 
pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sonya 
was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some 
verses for her the first he had ever written boris 
and natasha were at the other window and ceased talking 
when vera entered sonya and natasha looked at vera with 
guilty happy faces  it was pleasant and touching to 
see these little girls in love but apparently the sight 
of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera   
often have i asked you not to take my things 
she said  have a room of your own and 
she took the inkstand from nicholas   a minute 
in a minute he said dipping his pen   
always manage to do things at the wrong time continued 
vera  came rushing into the drawing room so that 
everyone felt ashamed of you  though what she said 
was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one 
replied and the four simply looked at one another she 
lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand 
  at your age what secrets can there be 
between natasha and boris or between you two it all 
nonsense   vera what does it matter to you 
said natasha in defense speaking very gently  she seemed 
that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate 
to everyone   silly said vera  am ashamed 
of you secrets indeed   have secrets of their 
own answered natasha getting warmer  don interfere with you 
and berg   should think not said vera  
there can never be anything wrong in my behavior but 
i just tell mamma how you are behaving with boris 
  ilynichna behaves very well to me remarked boris 
 have nothing to complain of   boris you 
are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said 
natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly  used 
the word  which was just then much in vogue 
among the children in the special sense they attached to 
it  does she bother me and she added turning 
to vera  never understand it because you never loved 
anyone you have no heart you are a madame de 
genlis and nothing more  nickname bestowed on vera by 
nicholas was considered very stinging  your greatest pleasure is 
to be unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg 
as much as you please she finished quickly   
shall at any rate not run after a young man 
before visitors   now you done what you wanted 
put in nicholas unpleasant things to everyone and upset them 
let go to the nursery  all four like a 
flock of scared birds got up and left the room 
  unpleasant things were said to me remarked vera 
 said none to anyone   de genlis madame 
de genlis shouted laughing voices through the door  the 
handsome vera who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect 
on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been 
said to her went to the looking glass and arranged 
her hair and scarf looking at her own handsome face 
she seemed to become still colder and calmer   
in the drawing room the conversation was still going on 
  my dear said the countess  life is 
not all roses either don i know that at the 
rate we are living our means won last long it 
all the club and his easygoing nature even in the 
country do we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven 
knows what besides but don let talk about me tell 
me how you managed everything i often wonder at you 
annette at your age you can rush off alone in 
a carriage to moscow to petersburg to those ministers and 
great people and know how to deal with them all 
it quite astonishing how did you get things settled i 
couldn possibly do it   my love answered anna 
mikhaylovna  grant you never know what it is to 
be left a widow without means and with a son 
you love to distraction one learns many things then she 
added with a certain pride  lawsuit taught me much 
when i want to see one of those big people 
i write a note  so desires an interview with 
so and and then i take a cab and go 
myself two three or four times i get what i 
want i don mind what they think of me  
 and to whom did you apply about bory asked 
the countess  see yours is already an officer in 
the guards while my nicholas is going as a cadet 
there no one to interest himself for him to whom 
did you apply   prince vasili he was so 
kind he at once agreed to everything and put the 
matter before the emperor said princess anna mikhaylovna enthusiastically quite 
forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her 
end   prince vasili aged much asked the countess 
 have not seen him since we acted together at 
the rumyantsovs theatricals i expect he has forgotten me he 
paid me attentions in those days said the countess with 
a smile   is just the same as ever 
replied anna mikhaylovna  with amiability his position has not 
turned his head at all he said to me  
am sorry i can do so little for you dear 
princess i am at your command yes he is a 
fine fellow and a very kind relation but nataly you 
know my love for my son i would do anything 
for his happiness and my affairs are in such a 
bad way that my position is now a terrible one 
continued anna mikhaylovna sadly dropping her voice  wretched lawsuit 
takes all i have and makes no progress would you 
believe it i have literally not a penny and don 
know how to equip boris she took out her handkerchief 
and began to cry  need five hundred rubles and 
have only one twenty note i am in such a 
state my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich 
bezukhov if he will not assist his godson know he 
is bory godfather allow him something for his maintenance all 
my trouble will have been thrown away i shall not 
be able to equip him  the countess eyes filled 
with tears and she pondered in silence   often 
think though perhaps it a sin said the princess  
here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich all alone 
that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth it 
a burden to him and bory life is only just 
beginning   he will leave something to boris said 
the countess   only knows my dear these rich 
grandees are so selfish still i will take boris and 
go to see him at once and i shall speak 
to him straight out let people think what they will 
of me it really all the same to me when 
my son fate is at stake the princess rose  
now two o and you dine at four there will 
just be time  and like a practical petersburg lady 
who knows how to make the most of time anna 
mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and went into 
the anteroom with him   my dear said she 
to the countess who saw her to the door and 
added in a whisper so that her son should not 
hear  me good luck   you going to 
count cyril vladimirovich my dear said the count coming out 
from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added 
 he is better ask pierre to dine with us 
he has been to the house you know and danced 
with the children be sure to invite him my dear 
we will see how taras distinguishes himself today he says 
count orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will 
be      chapter xv   
 dear boris said princess anna mikhaylovna to her son 
as countess rostova carriage in which they were seated drove 
over the straw covered street and turned into the wide 
courtyard of count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov house  dear boris 
said the mother drawing her hand from beneath her old 
mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son 
arm  affectionate and attentive to him count cyril vladimirovich 
is your godfather after all your future depends on him 
remember that my dear and be nice to him as 
you so well know how to be   only 
i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it 
answered her son coldly  i have promised and will 
do it for your sake  although the hall porter 
saw someone carriage standing at the entrance after scrutinizing the 
mother and son  without asking to be announced had 
passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of 
statues in niches and looking significantly at the lady old 
cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the 
princesses and hearing that they wished to see the count 
said his excellency was worse today and that his excellency 
was not receiving anyone   may as well go 
back said the son in french   dear exclaimed 
his mother imploringly again laying her hand on his arm 
as if that touch might soothe or rouse him  
boris said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother 
without taking off his cloak   friend said anna 
mikhaylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall porter  know 
count cyril vladimirovich is very ill that why i have 
come i am a relation i shall not disturb him 
my friend i only need see prince vasili sergeevich he 
is staying here is he not please announce me  
the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs 
and turned away   drubetskaya to see prince vasili 
sergeevich he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches 
shoes and a swallow coat who ran downstairs and looked 
over from the halfway landing  the mother smoothed the 
folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian 
mirror in the wall and in her trodden shoes briskly 
ascended the carpeted stairs   dear she said to 
her son once more stimulating him by a touch  
promised me  the son lowering his eyes followed her 
quietly  they entered the large hall from which one 
of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince 
vasili  just as the mother and son having reached 
the middle of the hall were about to ask their 
way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as 
they entered the bronze handle of one of the doors 
turned and prince vasili came out a velvet coat with 
a single star on his breast as was his custom 
when at home leave of a good dark man this 
was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain   it is 
certain said the prince   humanum est errare  
but replied the doctor swallowing his r and pronouncing the 
latin words with a french accent     
    to err is human   
 well very well  seeing anna mikhaylovna and her 
son prince vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and 
approached them silently and with a look of inquiry the 
son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded 
his mother face and he smiled slightly   prince 
in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is 
our dear invalid said she as though unaware of the 
cold offensive look fixed on her  prince vasili stared 
at her and at boris questioningly and perplexed boris bowed 
politely prince vasili without acknowledging the bow turned to anna 
mikhaylovna answering her query by a movement of the head 
and lips indicating very little hope for the patient  
 it possible exclaimed anna mikhaylovna  how awful it 
is terrible to think this is my son she added 
indicating boris  wanted to thank you himself  boris 
bowed again politely   me prince a mother heart 
will never forget what you have done for us  
 am glad i was able to do you a 
service my dear anna mikhaylovna said prince vasili arranging his 
lace frill and in tone and manner here in moscow 
to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation 
assuming an air of much greater importance than he had 
done in petersburg at anna scherer reception   to 
serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing boris 
with severity  am glad are you here on leave 
he went on in his usual tone of indifference  
 am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your 
excellency replied boris betraying neither annoyance at the prince brusque 
manner nor a desire to enter into conversation but speaking 
so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a 
searching glance   you living with your mother  
 am living at countess rostova replied boris again adding 
 excellency   is with ilya rostov who married 
nataly shinshina said anna mikhaylovna   know i know 
answered prince vasili in his monotonous voice  never could 
understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that 
unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a 
gambler too i am told   a very kind 
man prince said anna mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile as 
though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure 
but asked him not to be too hard on the 
poor old man  do the doctors say asked the 
princess after a pause her worn face again expressing deep 
sorrow   give little hope replied the prince  
 i should so like to thank uncle once for 
all his kindness to me and boris he is his 
godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact ought 
to give prince vasili much satisfaction  prince vasili became 
thoughtful and frowned anna mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid 
of finding in her a rival for count bezukhov fortune 
and hastened to reassure him   it were not 
for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle said she 
uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern  know 
his character noble upright but you see he has no 
one with him except the young princesses they are still 
young she bent her head and continued in a whisper 
 he performed his final duty prince how priceless are 
those last moments it can make things no worse and 
it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is 
so ill we women prince and she smiled tenderly  
know how to say these things i absolutely must see 
him however painful it may be for me i am 
used to suffering  evidently the prince understood her and 
also understood as he had done at anna pavlovna that 
it would be difficult to get rid of anna mikhaylovna 
  not such a meeting be too trying for 
him dear anna mikhaylovna said he  us wait until 
evening the doctors are expecting a crisis   one 
cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the 
welfare of his soul is at stake ah it is 
awful the duties of a christian  a door of 
one of the inner rooms opened and one of the 
princesses the count niece entered with a cold stern face 
the length of her body was strikingly out of proportion 
to her short legs prince vasili turned to her  
 how is he   the same but what 
can you expect this noise said the princess looking at 
anna mikhaylovna as at a stranger   my dear 
i hardly knew you said anna mikhaylovna with a happy 
smile ambling lightly up to the count niece  have 
come and am at your service to help you nurse 
my uncle i imagine what you have gone through and 
she sympathetically turned up her eyes  the princess gave 
no reply and did not even smile but left the 
room as anna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and occupying 
the position she had conquered settled down in an armchair 
inviting prince vasili to take a seat beside her  
 she said to her son with a smile  
shall go in to see the count my uncle but 
you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and 
don forget to give him the rostovs invitation they ask 
him to dinner i suppose he won go she continued 
turning to the prince   the contrary replied the 
prince who had plainly become depressed  shall be only 
too glad if you relieve me of that young man 
here he is and the count has not once asked 
for him  he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted 
boris down one flight of stairs and up another to 
pierre rooms      chapter xvi  
 pierre after all had not managed to choose a 
career for himself in petersburg and had been expelled from 
there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story 
told about him at count rostov was true pierre had 
taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he 
had now been for some days in moscow and was 
staying as usual at his father house though he expected 
that the story of his escapade would be already known 
in moscow and that the ladies about his father were 
never favorably disposed toward him have used it to turn 
the count against him he nevertheless on the day of 
his arrival went to his father part of the house 
entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of 
their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were 
sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it 
was the eldest who was reading one who had met 
anna mikhaylovna the two younger ones were embroidering both were 
rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one 
had a little mole on her lip which made her 
much prettier pierre was received as if he were a 
corpse or a leper the eldest princess paused in her 
reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the 
second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the 
one with the mole who was of a cheerful and 
lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile 
probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew 
her wool down through the canvas and scarcely able to 
refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out 
the pattern   do you do cousin said pierre 
 don recognize me   recognize you only too 
well too well   is the count can i 
see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but unabashed  
 count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you 
have done your best to increase his mental sufferings  
 i see the count pierre again asked   
if you wish to kill him to kill him outright 
you can see him olga go and see whether uncle 
beef tea is ready is almost time she added giving 
pierre to understand that they were busy and busy making 
his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only busy 
causing him annoyance  olga went out pierre stood looking 
at the sisters then he bowed and said  i 
will go to my rooms you will let me know 
when i can see him  and he left the 
room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the 
sister with the mole  next day prince vasili had 
arrived and settled in the count house he sent for 
pierre and said to him  dear fellow if you 
are going to behave here as you did in petersburg 
you will end very badly that is all i have 
to say to you the count is very very ill 
and you must not see him at all  since 
then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the 
whole time in his rooms upstairs  when boris appeared 
at his door pierre was pacing up and down his 
room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures 
at the wall as if running a sword through an 
invisible foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then 
again resuming his walk muttering indistinct words shrugging his shoulders 
and gesticulating   is done for said he scowling 
and pointing his finger at someone unseen  pitt as 
a traitor to the nation and to the rights of 
man is sentenced to but before pierre at that moment 
imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have 
just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover 
and captured london pronounce pitt sentence he saw a well 
and handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he 
had left moscow when boris was a boy of fourteen 
and had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive 
and hearty way he took boris by the hand with 
a friendly smile   you remember me asked boris 
quietly with a pleasant smile  have come with my 
mother to see the count but it seems he is 
not well   it seems he is ill people 
are always disturbing him answered pierre trying to remember who 
this young man was  boris felt that pierre did 
not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to 
introduce himself and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre 
straight in the face   rostov asks you to 
come to dinner today said he after a considerable pause 
which made pierre feel uncomfortable   count rostov exclaimed 
pierre joyfully  you are his son ilya only fancy 
i didn know you at first do you remember how 
we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot it 
such an age   are mistaken said boris deliberately 
with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile  am boris 
son of princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya rostov the father is 
ilya and his son is nicholas i never knew any 
madame jacquot  pierre shook his head and arms as 
if attacked by mosquitoes or bees   dear what 
am i thinking about i mixed everything up one has 
so many relatives in moscow so you are boris of 
course well now we know where we are and what 
do you think of the boulogne expedition the english will 
come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the 
channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only 
villeneuve doesn make a mess of things  boris knew 
nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the 
papers and it was the first time he had heard 
villeneuve name   here in moscow are more occupied 
with dinner parties and scandal than with politics said he 
in his quiet ironical tone  know nothing about it 
and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy 
with gossip he continued  now they are talking about 
you and your father  pierre smiled in his good 
way as if afraid for his companion sake that the 
latter might say something he would afterwards regret but boris 
spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into pierre eyes 
  has nothing else to do but gossip boris 
went on  is wondering to whom the count will 
leave his fortune though he may perhaps outlive us all 
as i sincerely hope he will   it is 
all very horrid interrupted pierre  horrid  pierre was 
still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting 
to himself   it must seem to you said 
boris flushing slightly but not changing his tone or attitude 
 must seem to you that everyone is trying to 
get something out of the rich man   it 
does thought pierre   i just wish to say 
to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you 
reckon me or my mother among such people we are 
very poor but for my own part at any rate 
for the very reason that your father is rich i 
don regard myself as a relation of his and neither 
i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything 
from him  for a long time pierre could not 
understand but when he did he jumped up from the 
sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy 
way and blushing far more than boris began to speak 
with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation   
this is strange do you suppose i who could think 
i know very well  but boris again interrupted him 
  am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps 
you did not like it you must excuse me said 
he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at 
ease by him  i hope i have not offended 
you i always make it a rule to speak out 
well what answer am i to take will you come 
to dinner at the rostovs  and boris having apparently 
relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from 
an awkward situation and placed another in it became quite 
pleasant again   but i say said pierre calming 
down  are a wonderful fellow what you have just 
said is good very good of course you don know 
me we have not met for such a long time 
not since we were children you might think that i 
i understand quite understand i could not have done it 
myself i should not have had the courage but it 
splendid i am very glad to have made your acquaintance 
it queer he added after a pause  you should 
have suspected me he began to laugh  what of 
it i hope we get better acquainted and he pressed 
boris hand  you know i have not once been 
in to see the count he has not sent for 
me i am sorry for him as a man but 
what can one do   so you think napoleon 
will manage to get an army across asked boris with 
a smile  pierre saw that boris wished to change 
the subject and being of the same mind he began 
explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition  
a footman came in to summon boris princess was going 
pierre in order to make boris better acquaintance promised to 
come to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately 
over his spectacles into boris eyes after he had gone 
pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a 
long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his 
imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant 
intelligent and resolute young man  as often happens in 
early youth especially to one who leads a lonely life 
he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and 
made up his mind that they would be friends  
prince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief 
to her eyes and her face was tearful   
is dreadful dreadful she was saying  cost me what 
it may i shall do my duty i will come 
and spend the night he must not be left like 
this every moment is precious i can think why his 
nieces put it off perhaps god will help me to 
find a way to prepare him adieu prince may god 
support you   ma bonne answered prince vasili turning 
away from her   he is in a dreadful 
state said the mother to her son when they were 
in the carriage  hardly recognizes anybody   don 
understand mamma is his attitude to pierre asked the son 
  will will show that my dear our fate 
also depends on it   why do you expect 
that he will leave us anything   my dear 
he is so rich and we are so poor  
 that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma   
heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother   
   chapter xvii   after anna mikhaylovna 
had driven off with her son to visit count cyril 
vladimirovich bezukhov countess rostova sat for a long time all 
alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she 
rang   is the matter with you my dear 
she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting 
some minutes  you wish to serve me then i 
find you another place  the countess was upset by 
her friend sorrow and humiliating poverty and was therefore out 
of sorts a state of mind which with her always 
found expression in calling her maid  dear and speaking 
to her with exaggerated politeness   am very sorry 
ma answered the maid   the count to come 
to me  the count came waddling in to see 
his wife with a rather guilty look as usual  
 little countess what a saute of game au madere 
we are to have my dear i tasted it the 
thousand rubles i paid for taras were not ill he 
is worth it  he sat down by his wife 
his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his 
gray hair   are your commands little countess  
 see my dear what that mess she said pointing 
to his waistcoat  the saute most likely she added 
with a smile  you see count i want some 
money  her face became sad   little countess 
and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook 
  want a great deal count i want five 
hundred rubles and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began 
wiping her husband waistcoat   immediately immediately hey who 
there he called out in a tone only used by 
persons who are certain that those they call will rush 
to obey the summons  dmitri to me  dmitri 
a man of good family who had been brought up 
in the count house and now managed all his affairs 
stepped softly into the room   is what i

young man who had entered  me he reflected a 
moment  bring me seven hundred rubles yes but mind 
don bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last 
time but nice clean ones for the countess   
dmitri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply  
 would you like them your excellency asked dmitri  
me to inform you but don be uneasy he added 
noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and 
quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger  
was forgetting do you wish it brought at once  
 yes just so bring it give it to the 
countess   a treasure that dmitri is added the 
count with a smile when the young man had departed 
 is never any  with him that a thing 
i hate everything is possible   money count money 
how much sorrow it causes in the world said the 
countess  i am in great need of this sum 
  my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said 
the count and having kissed his wife hand he went 
back to his study  when anna mikhaylovna returned from 
count bezukhov the money all in clean notes was lying 
ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table and 
anna mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her   
my dear asked the countess   what a terrible 
state he is in one would not know him he 
is so ill i was only there a few moments 
and hardly said a word   for heaven sake 
don refuse me the countess began with a blush that 
looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and 
she took the money from under the handkerchief  anna 
mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready 
to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment   
is for boris from me for his outfit  anna 
mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess wept 
too they wept because they were friends and because they 
were kindhearted and because they from childhood to think about 
such a base thing as money and because their youth 
was over but those tears were pleasant to them both 
     chapter xviii   countess 
rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests 
was already seated in the drawing room the count took 
the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice 
collection of turkish pipes from time to time he went 
out to ask  she come yet they were expecting 
marya dmitrievna akhrosimova known in society as le terrible dragon 
a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for 
common sense and frank plainness of speech marya dmitrievna was 
known to the imperial family as well as to all 
moscow and petersburg and both cities wondered at her laughed 
privately at her rudenesses and told good stories about her 
while none the less all without exception respected and feared 
her  in the count room which was full of 
tobacco smoke they talked of war that had been announced 
in a manifesto and about the recruiting none of them 
had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it 
had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two 
guests who were smoking and talking he neither smoked nor 
talked but bending his head first to one side and 
then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure 
and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom 
he egged on against each other  one of them 
was a sallow clean civilian with a thin and wrinkled 
face already growing old though he was dressed like a 
most fashionable young man he sat with his legs up 
on the sofa as if quite at home and having 
stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling 
the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was 
an old bachelor shinshin a cousin of the countess a 
man with  sharp tongue as they said in moscow 
society he seemed to be condescending to his companion the 
latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washed 
brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of 
his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke 
letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings this 
was lieutenant berg an officer in the semenov regiment with 
whom boris was to travel to join the army and 
about whom natasha had teased her elder sister vera speaking 
of berg as her  the count sat between them 
and listened attentively his favorite occupation when not playing boston 
a card game he was very fond of was that 
of listener especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious 
talkers at one another   then old chap mon 
tres honorable alphonse karlovich said shinshin laughing ironically and mixing 
the most ordinary russian expressions with the choicest french phrases 
was a peculiarity of his speech  comptez vous faire 
des rentes sur l  you want to make something 
out of your company       
  you expect to make an income out of 
the government    peter nikolaevich i only want 
to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far 
less than in the infantry just consider my own position 
now peter nikolaevich  berg always spoke quietly politely and 
with great precision his conversation always related entirely to himself 
he would remain calm and silent when the talk related 
to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself 
he could remain silent for hours without being at all 
put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but 
as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin 
to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction   my 
position peter nikolaevich were i in the cavalry i should 
get not more than two hundred rubles every four months 
even with the rank of lieutenant but as it is 
i receive two hundred and thirty said he looking at 
shinshin and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as 
if it were obvious to him that his success must 
always be the chief desire of everyone else   
that peter nikolaevich by exchanging into the guards i shall 
be in a more prominent position continued berg  vacancies 
occur much more frequently in the foot guards then just 
think what can be done with two hundred and thirty 
rubles i even manage to put a little aside and 
to send something to my father he went on emitting 
a smoke ring   balance y est  a 
german knows how to skin a flint as the proverb 
says remarked shinshin moving his pipe to the other side 
of his mouth and winking at the count   
       so that squares 
matters   the count burst out laughing the other 
guests seeing that shinshin was talking came up to listen 
berg oblivious of irony or indifference continued to explain how 
by exchanging into the guards he had already gained a 
step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how 
in wartime the company commander might get killed and he 
as senior in the company might easily succeed to the 
post how popular he was with everyone in the regiment 
and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently 
enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect 
that others too might have their own interests but all 
he said was so prettily sedate and the naivete of 
his youthful egotism was so obvious that he disarmed his 
hearers   my boy you get along wherever you 
go or horse i warrant said shinshin patting him on 
the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa  
berg smiled joyously the count by his guests went into 
the drawing room  it was just the moment before 
a big dinner when the assembled guests expecting the summons 
to zakuska  avoid engaging in any long conversation but 
think it necessary to move about and talk in order 
to show that they are not at all impatient for 
their food the host and hostess look toward the door 
and now and then glance at one another and the 
visitors try to guess from these glances who or what 
they are waiting for important relation who has not yet 
arrived or a dish that is not yet ready  
       hors d  
 pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting 
awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the 
first chair he had come across blocking the way for 
everyone the countess tried to make him talk but he 
went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if 
in search of somebody and answered all her questions in 
monosyllables he was in the way and was the only 
one who did not notice the fact most of the 
guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with 
curiosity at this big stout quiet man wondering how such 
a clumsy modest fellow could have played such a prank 
on a policeman   have only lately arrived the 
countess asked him   madame replied he looking around 
him   have not yet seen my husband  
 madame he smiled quite inappropriately   have been 
in paris recently i believe i suppose it very interesting 
  interesting  the countess exchanged glances with anna 
mikhaylovna the latter understood that she was being asked to 
entertain this young man and sitting down beside him she 
began to speak about his father but he answered her 
as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other 
guests were all conversing with one another  razumovskis it 
was charming you are very kind countess apraksina was heard 
on all sides the countess rose and went into the 
ballroom   dmitrievna came her voice from there  
 came the answer in a rough voice and marya 
dmitrievna entered the room  all the unmarried ladies and 
even the married ones except the very oldest rose marya 
dmitrievna paused at the door tall and stout holding high 
her fifty head with its gray curls she stood surveying 
the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if 
rolling them up marya dmitrievna always spoke in russian  
 and happiness to her whose name day we are 
keeping and to her children she said in her loud 
full voice which drowned all others  you old sinner 
she went on turning to the count who was kissing 
her hand  feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhere 
to hunt with your dogs but what is to be 
done old man just see how these nestlings are growing 
up and she pointed to the girls  must look 
for husbands for them whether you like it or not 
  said she  my cossack  dmitrievna always 
called natasha a cossack and she stroked the child arm 
as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her 
hand  know she a scamp of a girl but 
i like her  she took a pair of pear 
ruby earrings from her huge reticule and having given them 
to the rosy natasha who beamed with the pleasure of 
her saint fete turned away at once and addressed herself 
to pierre   eh friend come here a bit 
said she assuming a soft high tone of voice  
here my friend and she ominously tucked up her sleeves 
still higher pierre approached looking at her in a childlike 
way through his spectacles   nearer come nearer friend 
i used to be the only one to tell your 
father the truth when he was in favor and in 
your case it my evident duty she paused all were 
silent expectant of what was to follow for this was 
clearly only a prelude   fine lad my word 
a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed and 
he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for 
shame sir for shame it would be better if you 
went to the war  she turned away and gave 
her hand to the count who could hardly keep from 
laughing   i suppose it is time we were 
at table said marya dmitrievna  the count went in 
first with marya dmitrievna the countess followed on the arm 
of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to 
them because nicholas was to go with him to the 
regiment then came anna mikhaylovna with shinshin berg gave his 
arm to vera the smiling julie karagina went in with 
nicholas after them other couples followed filling the whole dining 
hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses 
followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the 
band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled 
down in their places then the strains of the count 
household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and 
forks the voices of visitors and the soft steps of 
the footmen at one end of the table sat the 
countess with marya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna 
on her left the other lady visitors were farther down 
at the other end sat the count with the hussar 
colonel on his left and shinshin and the other male 
visitors on his right midway down the long table on 
one side sat the grownup young people vera beside berg 
and pierre beside boris and on the other side the 
children tutors and governesses from behind the crystal decanters and 
fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife and 
her tall cap with its light ribbons and busily filled 
his neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in 
turn without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances 
from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and 
bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than 
usual with his gray hair at the ladies end an 
even chatter of voices was heard all the time at 
the men end the voices sounded louder and louder especially 
that of the colonel of hussars who growing more and 
more flushed ate and drank so much that the count 
held him up as a pattern to the other guests 
berg with tender smiles was saying to vera that love 
is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling boris was 
telling his new friend pierre who the guests were and 
exchanging glances with natasha who was sitting opposite pierre spoke 
little but examined the new faces and ate a great 
deal of the two soups he chose turtle with savory 
patties and went on to the game without omitting a 
single dish or one of the wines these latter the 
butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind 
the next man shoulders and whispered  madeira  or 
 wine as the case might be of the four 
crystal glasses engraved with the count monogram that stood before 
his plate pierre held out one at random and drank 
with enjoyment gazing with ever amiability at the other guests 
natasha who sat opposite was looking at boris as girls 
of thirteen look at the boy they are in love 
with and have just kissed for the first time sometimes 
that same look fell on pierre and that funny lively 
little girl look made him inclined to laugh without knowing 
why  nicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside 
julie karagina to whom he was again talking with the 
same involuntary smile sonya wore a company smile but was 
evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned pale now blushed 
and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie 
were saying to one another the governess kept looking round 
uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might 
be put upon the children the german tutor was trying 
to remember all the dishes wines and kinds of dessert 
in order to send a full description of the dinner 
to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended 
when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin 
passed him by he frowned trying to appear as if 
he did not want any of that wine but was 
mortified because no one would understand that it was not 
to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted 
it but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge  
    chapter xix   at the 
men end of the table the talk grew more and 
more animated the colonel told them that the declaration of 
war had already appeared in petersburg and that a copy 
which he had himself seen had that day been forwarded 
by courier to the commander in chief   why 
the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshin 
 has stopped austria cackle and i fear it will 
be our turn next  the colonel was a stout 
tall plethoric german evidently devoted to the service and patriotically 
russian he resented shinshin remark   is for the 
reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a german 
accent  the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he 
declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference 
ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity 
of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity of its 
alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as 
if in it lay the gist of the matter  
then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he 
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto   
and the wish which constitutes the emperor sole and absolute 
aim establish peace in europe on firm foundations now decided 
him to despatch part of the army abroad and to 
create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose 
  my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking 
a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the 
count for approval   le proverbe   jerome 
do not roam but turn spindles at home said shinshin 
puckering his brows and smiling  nous convient a merveille 
suvorov now knew what he was about yet they beat 
him a plate couture and where are we to find 
suvorovs now je vous demande un peu said he continually 
changing from french to russian      
   you know the proverb    
    that suits us down to the 
ground        hollow  
      i just ask you 
that    must vight to the last tr 
of our plood said the colonel thumping the table  
ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill 
pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as 
po he dwelt particularly on the word possible  po 
he ended again turning to the count  is how 
ve old hussars look at it and zere an end 
of it and how do you a young man and 
a young hussar how do you judge of it he 
added addressing nicholas who when he heard that the war 
was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes 
and ears intent on the colonel   am quite 
of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning his plate 
round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision 
and desperation as though he were at that moment facing 
some great danger  am convinced that we russians must 
die or conquer he concluded conscious were others the words 
were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic 
for the occasion and were therefore awkward   you 
said just now was splendid said his partner julie  
sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and 
behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while 
nicholas was speaking  pierre listened to the colonel speech 
and nodded approvingly   fine said he   
young man a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping 
the table   are you making such a noise 
about over there marya dmitrievna deep voice suddenly inquired from 
the other end of the table  are you thumping 
the table for she demanded of the hussar  why 
are you exciting yourself do you think the french are 
here   am speaking ze truce replied the hussar 
with a smile   all about the war the 
count shouted down the table  know my son going 
marya dmitrievna my son is going   have four 
sons in the army but still i don fret it 
is all in god hands you may die in your 
bed or god may spare you in a battle replied 
marya dmitrievna deep voice which easily carried the whole length 
of the table   true  once more the 
conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and the 
men at the other   won ask natasha little 
brother was saying  know you won ask   
will replied natasha  her face suddenly flushed with reckless 
and joyous resolution she half rose by a glance inviting 
pierre who sat opposite to listen to what was coming 
and turning to her mother   rang out the 
clear contralto notes of her childish voice audible the whole 
length of the table   is it asked the 
countess startled but seeing by her daughter face that it 
was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly 
with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head  
the conversation was hushed   what sweets are we 
going to have and natasha voice sounded still more firm 
and resolute  the countess tried to frown but could 
not marya dmitrievna shook her fat finger   she 
said threateningly  most of the guests uncertain how to 
regard this sally looked at the elders   had 
better take care said the countess   what sweets 
are we going to have natasha again cried boldly with 
saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in 
good part  sonya and fat little petya doubled up 
with laughter   see i have asked whispered natasha 
to her little brother and to pierre glancing at him 
again   pudding but you won get any said 
marya dmitrievna  natasha saw there was nothing to be 
afraid of and so she braved even marya dmitrievna  
 dmitrievna what kind of ice pudding i don like 
ice cream   ices   what kind marya 
dmitrievna what kind she almost screamed  want to know 
 marya dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing and 
all the guests joined in everyone laughed not at marya 
dmitrievna answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of 
this little girl who had dared to treat marya dmitrievna 
in this fashion  natasha only desisted when she had 
been told that there would be pineapple ice before the 
ices champagne was served round the band again struck up 
the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving their 
seats went up to  the countess and reached across 
the table to clink glasses with the count with the 
children and with one another again the footmen rushed about 
chairs scraped and in the same order in which they 
had entered but with redder faces the guests returned to 
the drawing room and to the count study   
   chapter xx   the card tables 
were drawn out sets made up for boston and the 
count visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms 
some in the sitting room some in the library  
the count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty 
from dropping into his usual after nap and laughed at 
everything the young people at the countess instigation gathered round 
the clavichord and harp julie by general request played first 
after she had played a little air with variations on 
the harp she joined the other young ladies in begging 
natasha and nicholas who were noted for their musical talent 
to sing something natasha who was treated as though she 
were grown up was evidently very proud of this but 
at the same time felt shy   shall we 
sing she said   brook suggested nicholas   
then let be quick boris come here said natasha  
where is sonya  she looked round and seeing that 
her friend was not in the room ran to look 
for her  running into sonya room and not finding 
her there natasha ran to the nursery but sonya was 
not there either natasha concluded that she must be on 
the chest in the passage the chest in the passage 
was the place of mourning for the younger female generation 
in the rostov household and there in fact was sonya 
lying face downward on nurse dirty feather bed on the 
top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under 
her hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing 
so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook natasha face 
which had been so radiantly happy all that saint day 
suddenly changed her eyes became fixed and then a shiver 
passed down her broad neck and the corners of her 
mouth drooped   what is it what is the 
matter oo oo oo and natasha large mouth widened making 
her look quite ugly and she began to wail like 
a baby without knowing why except that sonya was crying 
sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could 
not and hid her face still deeper in the bed 
natasha wept sitting on the blue feather bed and hugging 
her friend with an effort sonya sat up and began 
wiping her eyes and explaining   is going away 
in a week time his papers have come he told 
me himself but still i should not cry and she 
showed a paper she held in her hand the verses 
nicholas had written  i should not cry but you 
can no one can understand what a soul he has 
 and she began to cry again because he had 
such a noble soul   all very well for 
you i am not envious i love you and boris 
also she went on gaining a little strength  is 
nice there are no difficulties in your way but nicholas 
is my cousin one would have to the metropolitan himself 
and even then it can be done and besides if 
she tells mamma  looked upon the countess as her 
mother and called her so  i am spoiling nicholas 
career and am heartless and ungrateful while truly god is 
my witness and she made the sign of the cross 
 love her so much and all of you only 
vera and what for what have i done to her 
i am so grateful to you that i would willingly 
sacrifice everything only i have nothing  sonya could not 
continue and again hid her face in her hands and 
in the feather bed natasha began consoling her but her 
face showed that she understood all the gravity of her 
friend trouble   she suddenly exclaimed as if she 
had guessed the true reason of her friend sorrow  
sure vera has said something to you since dinner hasn 
she   these verses nicholas wrote himself and i 
copied some others and she found them on my table 
and said she show them to mamma and that i 
was ungrateful and that mamma would never allow him to 
marry me but that he marry julie you see how 
he been with her all day natasha what have i 
done to deserve it  and again she began to 
sob more bitterly than before natasha lifted her up hugged 
her and smiling through her tears began comforting her  
 don believe her darling don believe her do you 
remember how we and nicholas all three of us talked 
in the sitting room after supper why we settled how 
everything was to be i don quite remember how but 
don you remember that it could all be arranged and 
how nice it all was there uncle shinshin brother has 
married his first cousin and we are only second cousins 
you know and boris says it is quite possible you 
know i have told him all about it and he 
is so clever and so good said natasha  you 
cry sonya dear love darling sonya and she kissed her 
and laughed  spiteful never mind her and all will 
come right and she won say anything to mamma nicholas 
will tell her himself and he doesn care at all 
for julie  natasha kissed her on the hair  
sonya sat up the little kitten brightened its eyes shone 
and it seemed ready to lift its tail jump down 
on its soft paws and begin playing with the ball 
of worsted as a kitten should   you think 
so really truly she said quickly smoothing her frock and 
hair   truly answered natasha pushing in a crisp 
lock that had strayed from under her friend plaits  
both laughed   let go and sing  brook 
  along   you know that fat pierre 
who sat opposite me is so funny said natasha stopping 
suddenly  feel so happy  and she set off 
at a run along the passage  sonya shaking off 
some down which clung to her and tucking away the 
verses in the bosom of her dress close to her 
bony little chest ran after natasha down the passage into 
the sitting room with flushed face and light joyous steps 
at the visitors request the young people sang the quartette 
 brook with which everyone was delighted then nicholas sang 
a song he had just learned     
 at nighttime in the moon fair glow   
   how sweet as fancies wander free  
  to feel that in this world there one 
     who still is thinking but 
of thee     that while her fingers 
touch the harp      sweet music 
o the    it is for thee thus 
her heart      sighing its out 
to thee     a day or two 
then      but oh till then 
i cannot live   he had not finished the 
last before the young people began to get ready to 
dance in the large hall and the sound of the 
feet and the of the were heard from the gallery 
  pierre was sitting in the drawing where shinshin 
had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad 
in a political conversation in which several others joined but 
which bored pierre when the music began natasha came in 
and straight up to pierre said laughing and blushing  
 told me to ask you to join the  
 am afraid of mixing the pierre replied  if 
you will be my teacher and lowering his big arm 
he offered it to the slender little girl  while 
the couples were arranging themselves and the up pierre sat 
down with his little partner natasha was perfectly happy she 
was dancing with a grown man who had been abroad 
she was sitting in a place and talking to him 
like a grown lady she had a in her hand 
that one of the ladies had given her to hold 
assuming quite the of a society woman  knows when 
and where she had learned it she talked with her 
partner herself and smiling over the   dear just 
look at her exclaimed the countess as she the ballroom 
pointing to natasha  natasha blushed and laughed   
really mamma why should you what is there to be 
surprised at   in the midst of the third 
there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in 
the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had 
been playing cards with the of the more distinguished and 
older visitors they now themselves after sitting so long and 
their and entered the ballroom first came marya dmitrievna and 
the count both with merry the count with playful ceremony 
in style offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna he 
drew himself up a smile of lit up his face 
and as soon as the last figure of the was 
ended he his hands to the and shouted up to 
their gallery addressing the first   do you know 
the  this was the count favorite dance which he 
had danced in his youth  speaking was one figure 
of the   at papa shouted natasha to the 
whole company and quite forgetting that she was dancing with 
a grown partner she bent her curly head to her 
knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter 
 and indeed everybody in the room looked with a 
smile of pleasure at the old who standing beside his 
tall and stout partner marya dmitrievna curved his arms beat 
time his shoulders turned out his gently with his foot 
and by a smile that his round face more and 
more prepared the for what was to follow as soon 
as the gay strains of  those of a merry 
dance began to sound all the of the ballroom were 
suddenly filled by the serfs men on one side and 
the women on the other with beaming faces had come 
to see their making merry   look at the

stood in one of the  the count danced well 
and knew it but his partner could not and did 
not want to dance well her enormous figure stood erect 
her powerful arms hanging down  had her reticule to 
the countess and only her stern but handsome face really 
joined in the dance what was expressed by the whole 
of the count plump figure in marya dmitrievna found expression 
only in her more and more beaming face and quivering 
nose but if the count getting more and more into 
the swing of it charmed the by the of his 
and the with which he about on his light feet 
marya dmitrievna produced no less by slight least effort to 
move her shoulders or her arms when turning or her 
foot everyone appreciated in of her size and habitual severity 
the dance grew and the other couples could not attract 
a moment attention to their own and did not even 
try to do so all were watching the count and 
marya dmitrievna natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress 
them to  at papa though as it was they 
never took their eyes off the in the of the 
dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to the

on his heels until turning his partner round to her

smiling and making a wide with his arm amid a

while tired footmen and were getting the supper count bezukhov 
had a the doctors impossible after a was to the 
dying man made for the of and in his house 
there was the and of usual at such moments outside 
the house the a group of who hid whenever a 
carriage drove up waited in of an important order for 
an the military of moscow who had been in sending 
to after the count health came himself that evening to 
a last to the celebrated grandee of catherine court count 
bezukhov  the reception room was crowded everyone stood up 
respectfully when the military having stayed about half an hour 
alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their 
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from 
the glances fixed on him by the doctors and relatives 
of the family prince vasili who had grown and during 
the last few days him to the door repeating something 
to him several times in low tones  when the 
military had gone prince vasili sat down all alone on 
a chair in the ballroom crossing one high over the 
other his elbow on his knee and his face with 
his hand after sitting so for a while he rose 
and looking about him with frightened eyes went with hurried 
steps down the long leading to the back of the 
house to the room of the eldest princess  those 
who were in the lit reception room spoke in nervous 
and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying 
man room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of 
curiosity or at his door which slightly when opened  
 of human life are fixed and may not be 
o said an old to a lady who had taken 
a seat beside him and was listening naively to his 
words   wonder is it not too late to 
asked the lady adding the as if she had no 
opinion of her own on the subject   it 
is a great replied the passing his hand over the 
thin of hair back across his bald head   
was that the military himself was being asked at the 
other side of the room  young he is  
 and he is over i hear the count no 
longer recognizes anyone they wished to the of   
knew someone who received that seven times  the second 
princess had just come from the with her eyes red 
from weeping and sat down beside dr lorrain who was 
sitting in a graceful under a portrait of catherine his 
elbow on a table   said the doctor in 
answer to a remark about the weather  weather is 
beautiful princess and besides in moscow one as if one 
were in the country   indeed replied the princess 
with a sigh  he may have something to drink 
 lorrain considered   he taken his   
 the doctor glanced at his watch   a 
glass of water and put a pinch of cream of 
and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant 
by a pinch   has been a a german 
doctor was saying to an aide  one after de 
  what a well man he was remarked the 
aide  who will inherit his wealth he added in 
a whisper   go begging replied the german with 
a smile  everyone again looked toward the door which 
as the second princess went in with the drink she 
had prepared to lorrain the german doctor went up to 
lorrain   you think he can last till morning 
asked the german addressing lorrain in french which he badly 
 lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely finger 
before his nose   not later said he in 
a low voice and he moved away with a smile 
of self at being able clearly to understand and state 
the patient condition   meanwhile prince vasili had opened 
the door into the princess room  in this room 
it was almost dark only two tiny were burning before 
the and there was a pleasant of flowers and burnt 
the room was crowded with small of and little tables 
the of a high white feather bed was just visible 
behind a a small dog began to   is 
it you cousin  she rose and smoothed her hair 
which was as usual so that it seemed to be 
made of one piece with her head and covered with 
  anything happened she asked  am so terrified 
  there is no change i only came to 
have a talk about business  muttered the prince himself 
on the chair she had just  have made the 
place warm i must say he remarked  sit down 
let have a talk       
     thought perhaps something had happened 
she said with her unchanging severe expression and sitting down 
opposite the prince she prepared to listen   wished 
to get a nap mon cousin but i can  
 my dear said prince vasili taking her hand and 
bending it downwards as was his habit  it was 
plain that this  to much that they both understood 
without  the princess who had a straight body long 
for her legs looked at prince vasili with no sign 
of in her prominent gray eyes then she shook her 
head and glanced up at the with a sigh this 
might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and 
devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long 
prince vasili understood it as an expression of weariness  
 i he said  you think it is for 
me i am as worn out as a post horse 
but still i must have a talk with you a 
very serious talk  prince vasili said no more and 
his began to nervously now on one side now on 
the other giving his face an unpleasant expression which was 
never to be seen on it in a drawing room 
his eyes too seemed strange at one moment they looked 
sly and at the next glanced round in alarm  
the princess holding her little dog on her with her 
thin bony hands looked attentively into prince vasili eyes evidently 
not to be the first to break silence if she 
had to wait till morning   you see my 
dear princess and cousin catherine continued prince vasili returning to 
his apparently not without an inner  such a moment 
as this one must think of everything one must think 
of the future of all of you i love you 
all like children of my own as you know  
the princess continued to look at him without moving and 
with the same dull expression   then of course 
my family has also to be considered prince vasili went 
on pushing away a little table without looking at her 
 know that we three sisters and my wife the 
count only direct i know i know how hard it 
is for you to talk or think of such matters 
it is no for me but my dear i am 
getting on for and must be prepared for anything do 
you know i have sent for pierre the count pointing 
to his portrait  demanded that he should be called 
 prince vasili looked questioningly at the princess but could 
not make out whether she was considering what he had 
just said or whether she was simply looking at him 
  is one thing i constantly god to grant 
mon cousin she replied  it is that he would 
be to him and would allow his noble soul to 
leave this   yes of course interrupted prince vasili 
rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him 
the little table that he had pushed away  in 
short the fact is you know yourself that last winter 
the count made a will by which he left all 
his property not to us his direct but to pierre 
  has made enough quietly remarked the princess  
he cannot leave the to pierre pierre is illegitimate  
 my dear said prince vasili suddenly the little table 
and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly  if 
a letter has been written to the emperor in which 
the count asks for pierre do you understand that in 
consideration of the count his request would be  the 
princess smiled as people do who think they know more 
about the subject under than those they are talking with 
  can tell you more continued prince vasili her 
hand  letter was written though it was not sent 
and the emperor knew of it the only question is 
has it been destroyed or not if not then as 
soon as all is over and prince vasili to intimate 
what he meant by the words all is over  
the count papers are opened the will and letter will 
be delivered to the emperor and the will certainly be 
pierre will get everything as the son   our 
asked the princess smiling ironically as if anything might happen 
only not that   my poor it is as 
clear as he will then be the heir to everything 
and you won get anything you must know my dear 
whether the will and letter were written and whether they 
have been destroyed or not and if they have somehow 
been you ought to know where they are and must 
find them because   next the princess interrupted smiling 
and not changing the expression of her eyes  am 
a woman and you think we are all stupid but 
i know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un  
she added as if that this of the word would 
prove to prince vasili the of his    
     a    really 
can you understand you are so intelligent how is it 
you don see that if the count has written a 
letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as 
it follows that pierre will not be pierre but will 
become count bezukhov and will then inherit everything under the 
will and if the will and letter are not destroyed 
then you will have nothing but the of having been 
qui  that certain       
  and all that follows    know 
the will was made but i also know that it 
is invalid and you mon cousin seem to consider me 
a fool said the princess with the expression women when 
they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging  
 dear princess catherine began prince vasili  came here 
not to with you but to talk about your interests 
as with a a good kind true relation and i 
tell you for the tenth time that if the letter 
to the emperor and the will in pierre favor are 
among the count papers then my dear girl you and 
your sisters are not if you don believe me then 
believe an i have just been talking to dmitri  
family  he says the same  at this a 
change evidently took place in the princess ideas her thin 
lips grew white though her eyes did not change and 
her voice when she began to speak passed through such 
as she herself evidently did not expect   would 
be a fine thing said she  never wanted anything 
and i don now  she pushed the little dog 
off her and smoothed her dress   this is 
gratitude is for those who have everything for his sake 
she cried  splendid fine i don want anything prince 
  but you are not the only one there 
are your sisters replied prince vasili  but the princess 
did not listen to him   i knew it 
long ago but had forgotten i knew that i could 
expect nothing but and this house   you or 
do you not know where that will is prince vasili 
his more than ever   i was a fool 
i still believed in people loved them and myself but 
only the base the succeed i know who has been 
 the princess wished to rise but the prince held 
her by the hand she had the air of one 
who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race 
she gave her companion an angry glance   is 
still time my dear you must remember that it was 
all done in a moment of anger of illness and 
was afterwards forgotten our duty my dear is to his 
mistake to ease his last moments by not letting him 
commit this and not to let him die feeling that 
he is unhappy those who   everything for him 
chimed in the princess who would again have had not 
the prince still held her fast  he never could 
appreciate it no mon cousin she added with a sigh 
 shall always remember that in this world one must 
expect no reward that in this world there is neither 
honor nor in this world one has to be and 
cruel   come come be i know your excellent 
heart   i have a wicked heart   
know your heart repeated the prince  value your friendship 
and wish you to have as good an opinion of 
me don upset yourself and let us talk while there 
is still time be it a day or be it 
but an hour tell me all you know about the 
will and above all where it is you must know 
we will take it at once and show it to 
the count he has no doubt forgotten it and will 
wish to it you understand that my sole desire is 
to carry out his wishes that is my only reason 
for being here i came simply to help him and 
you   i see it all i know who 
has been know cried the princess   not the 
point my dear   that of yours that sweet 
princess drubetskaya that anna mikhaylovna whom i would not take 
for a the woman   not let us lose 
any time   don talk to me last winter 
she herself in here and told the count such things 
about us especially about can them it made the count 
quite ill and he would not see us for a 
whole i know it was then he wrote this paper 
but i thought the thing was invalid   got 
to it at last did you not tell me about 
it sooner   in the that he under his 
said the princess his question  i know yes if 
i have a sin a great sin it is hatred 
of that woman almost the princess now quite changed  
what does she come herself in here for but i 
will give her a piece of my mind the time 
will come      chapter   
while these conversations were going on in the reception room 
and the princess room a carriage pierre  had been 
sent for and anna mikhaylovna  found it necessary to 
him was into the court of count bezukhov house as 
the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the anna 
mikhaylovna having turned with words of to her companion realized 
that he was in his corner and him up himself 
pierre followed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only 
then began to think of the interview with his dying 
father which him he noticed that they had not come 
to the front entrance but to the back door while 
he was getting down from the carriage steps two men 
who looked like ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid 
in the of the wall for a moment pierre noticed 
several other men of the same kind hiding in the 
of the house on both sides but neither anna mikhaylovna 
nor the footman nor the who could not help seeing 
these people took any notice of them  seems to 
be all right pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovna she 
hurriedly ascended the lit stone staircase calling to pierre who 
was behind to follow though he did not see why 
it was necessary for him to go to the count 
at all still less why he had to go by 
the back stairs yet by anna mikhaylovna air of assurance 
and pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary halfway 
up the stairs they were almost over by some men 
who carrying came running downstairs their these men pressed close 
to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass 
and did not the least surprise at seeing them there 
  this the way to the princesses apartments asked 
anna mikhaylovna of one of them   replied a 
footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were 
now  door to the left ma   the 
count did not ask for me said pierre when he 
reached the landing  better go to my own room 
 anna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come 
up   my friend she said touching his arm 
as she had done her son when speaking to him 
that  me i suffer no less than you do 
but be a man   really i better go 
away he asked looking kindly at her over his spectacles 
  my dear friend forget the that may have 
been done you think that he is your father perhaps 
in the of death she  have loved you like 
a son from the first yourself to me pierre i 
shall not forget your interests  pierre did not understand 
a word but the conviction that all this had to 
be grew and he followed anna mikhaylovna who was already 
opening a door  this door led into a back 
anteroom an old man a of the princesses sat in 
a corner a pierre had never been in this part 
of the house and did not even know of the 
of these rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was 
hurrying past with a on a as  dear and 
 sweet asked about the princess health and then led 
pierre along a stone passage the first door on the 
left led into the princesses apartments the maid with the 
in her had not closed the door  in the 
house was done in at that time and pierre and 
anna mikhaylovna in passing glanced into the room where prince 
vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking 
seeing them pass prince vasili drew back with obvious impatience 
while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of 
desperation the door with all her might  this was 
so unlike her usual and the fear on prince vasili 
face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre 
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his anna 
mikhaylovna no surprise she only smiled and as if to 
say that this was no more than she had expected 
  a man my friend i will look after 
your interests said she in reply to his look and 
went still along the passage  pierre could not make 
out what it was all about and still less what 
 over his interests meant but he decided that all 
these things had to be from the passage they went 
into a large lit room adjoining the count reception room 
it was one of those but cold apartments known to 
pierre only from the front but even in this room 
there now stood an empty and water had been on 
the they were met by a with a and by 
a who passed out on without heeding them they went 
into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian 
opening into the conservatory with its large and full length 
portrait of catherine the great the same people were still 
sitting here in almost the same positions as before to 
one another all became silent and turned to look at 
the pale tear anna mikhaylovna as she entered and at 
the big stout figure of pierre who hanging his head 
followed her  anna mikhaylovna face expressed a consciousness that 
the moment had arrived with the air of a practical 
petersburg lady she now keeping pierre close beside her entered 
the room even more boldly than that she felt that 
as she brought with her the person the dying man 
wished to see her own was a glance at all 
those in the room and noticing the count there she 
up to him with a sort of not exactly yet 
to grow suddenly and respectfully received the first of one 
and then of another   be thanked that you 
are in time said she to one of the  
we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man 
is the count son she added more softly  a 
terrible moment  having said this she went up to 
the doctor   doctor said she  young man 
is the count son is there any hope  the 
doctor a glance and silently shrugged his shoulders anna mikhaylovna 
with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes 
almost the latter and moved away from the doctor to 
pierre to him in a particularly and tenderly sad voice 
she said   in his mercy and pointing out 
a small sofa for him to sit and wait for 
her she went silently toward the door that everyone was 
watching and it very slightly as she behind it  
pierre having made up his mind to obey his moved 
toward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna 
mikhaylovna had he noticed that the eyes of all in 
the room turned to him with something more than curiosity 
and sympathy he noticed that they whispered to one another 
significant looks at him with a kind of and even 
a such as he had never before received was shown 
him a strange lady the one who had been talking 
to the rose and offered him her seat an aide 
picked up and returned a pierre had dropped the doctors 
became respectfully silent as he passed by and moved to 
make way for him at first pierre wished to take 
another seat so as not to trouble the lady and 
also to pick up the himself and to pass round 
the doctors who were not even in his way but 
all at once he felt that this would not do 
and that tonight he was a person to perform some 
sort of awful which everyone expected of him and that 
he was therefore to accept their he took the in 
silence from the aide and sat down in the lady 
chair placing his huge hands on his knees in the 
naive attitude of an and decided in his own mind 
that all was as it should be and that in 
order not to lose his head and do foolish things 
he must not act on his own ideas tonight but 
must himself up entirely to the will of those who 
were him  not two minutes had passed before prince 
vasili with head erect entered the room he was wearing 
his long coat with three stars on his breast he 
seemed to have grown since the morning his eyes seemed 
larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre 
he went up to him took his hand  thing 
he never used to do and drew it downwards as 
if wishing to whether it was firmly fixed on  
 courage my friend he has asked to see you 
that is well and he turned to go  but 
pierre thought it necessary to ask  is and not 
knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying 
man  count yet ashamed to call him   
 had another about half an hour ago courage my 
friend  pierre mind was in such a confused state 
that the word  suggested to him a blow from 
something he looked at prince vasili in and only later 
that a was an attack of illness prince vasili said 
something to lorrain in passing and went through the door 
on he could not walk well on and his whole 
body at each step the eldest princess followed him and 
the and and some also went in at the door 
through that door was heard a noise of things being 
moved about and at last anna mikhaylovna still with the 
same expression pale but resolute in the of duty ran 
out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said  
 mercy is is about to be come  pierre 
went in at the door on the soft and noticed 
that the strange lady the aide and some of the 
all followed him in as if there were now no 
further need for to enter that room    
  chapter   pierre well knew this large 
room divided by and an its round with the part 
of the room behind the with a high silk on 
one side and on the other an immense case was 
with red light like a russian during evening service under 
the stood a long invalid chair and in that chair 
on evidently changed pierre saw to the by a bright 
green familiar figure of his father count bezukhov with that 
gray of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one 
of a and the deep noble wrinkles of his handsome 
face he lay just under the his large thick hands 
outside the into the right hand which was lying palm 
downwards a had been thrust between and and an old 
bending over from behind the chair held it in position 
by the chair stood the their long hair falling over 
their with lighted in their hands slowly and solemnly the 
service a little behind them stood the two younger princesses 
holding to their eyes and just in front of them 
their eldest sister with a and determined look steadily fixed 
on the as though to all that she could not 
answer for herself should she glance round anna mikhaylovna with 
a and all expression on her face stood by the 
door near the strange lady prince vasili in front of 
the door near the invalid chair a in his left 
hand was his left arm on the back of a 
velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose and 
was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes 
each time he touched his forehead his face wore a 
calm look of and resignation to the will of god 
 you do not understand these he seemed to be 
saying  much the worse for you  behind him 
stood the aide the doctors and the the men and 
women had as in all were silently crossing themselves and 
the reading of the service the subdued of deep bass 
voices and in the and the of feet were the 
only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna with an 
air of importance that showed that she felt she quite 
knew what she was about went across the room to 
where pierre was standing and gave him a he lit 
it and by those around him began crossing himself with 
the hand that held the  the rosy laughter youngest 
princess with the mole watched him she smiled hid her 
face in her handkerchief and remained with it for then 
looking up and seeing pierre she again began to laugh 
she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing 
but could not looking at him so to be out 
of she slipped quietly behind one of the in the 
midst of the service the voices of the suddenly ceased 
they whispered to one another and the old who was 
holding the count hand got up and said something to 
the ladies anna mikhaylovna stepped forward and over the dying 
man to lorrain from behind her back the french doctor 
held no he was against one of the in a 
attitude that he a in spite of all of faith 
understood the full importance of the now being performed and 
even of it he now approached the man with the 
step of one in full of life with his delicate 
white fingers raised from the green the hand that was 
free and turning sideways felt the and reflected a moment 
the man was given something to drink there was a 
stir around him then the people resumed their places and 
the service continued during this pierre noticed that prince vasili 
left the chair on which he had been and an 
air which that he knew what he was about and 
if others did not understand him it was so much 
the worse for them not go up to the dying 
man but passed by him joined the eldest princess and 
moved with her to the side of the room where 
stood the high with its on leaving the bed both 
prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back 
door but returned to their places one after the other 
before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention 
to this than to the rest of what went on 
having made up his mind once for all that what 
he saw around him that evening was in some way 
essential  the of the service ceased and the voice 
of the was heard respectfully the dying man on having 
received the the dying man lay as lifeless and as 
before around him everyone began to stir steps were audible 
and among which anna mikhaylovna was the most distinct  
pierre heard her say   he must be moved 
onto the bed here it will be impossible  the 
man was so by doctors princesses and that pierre could 
no longer see the face with its gray though he 
saw other faces as well he had not lost sight 
of for a single moment during the whole service he 
by the movements of those who crowded round the invalid 
chair that they had lifted the dying man and were 
moving him   hold of my arm or you 
drop him he heard one of the say in a 
frightened whisper  hold from here exclaimed different voices and 
the heavy breathing of the and the of their feet 
grew more hurried as if the weight they were carrying 
were too much for them  as the among whom 
was anna mikhaylovna passed the young man he caught a 
momentary between their heads and of the dying man high 
stout chest and powerful shoulders raised by those who were 
holding him under the and of his gray curly head 
this head with its remarkably broad and its handsome mouth 
and its cold expression was not by the of death 
it was the same as pierre remembered it three months 
before when the count had sent him to petersburg but 
now this head was swaying with the movements of the 
and the cold listless fixed itself upon nothing  after 
a few minutes beside the high those who had carried 
the man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched pierre hand and said 
 pierre went with her to the bed on which 
the man had been laid in a in keeping with 
the ceremony just he lay with his head high on 
the his hands were placed on the green silk the 
downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight 
at him but with a look the of which could 
not be understood by man either this look meant nothing 
but that as long as one has eyes they must 
look somewhere or it meant too much pierre not knowing 
what to do and glanced inquiringly at his anna mikhaylovna 
made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the 
man hand and moving her lips as if to send 
it a kiss pierre carefully his neck so as not 
to touch the followed her and pressed his lips to 
the large hand neither the hand nor a single muscle 
of the count face once more pierre looked questioningly at 
anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next 
anna mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood 
beside the bed pierre sat down his eyes asking if 
he were doing right anna mikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre 
fell into the naively of an evidently distressed that his 
stout and clumsy body took up so much room and 
doing his to look as small as possible he looked 
at the count who still gazed at the spot where 
pierre face had been before he sat down anna mikhaylovna 
indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance 
of these last moments of meeting between the father and 
son this about two minutes which to pierre seemed an 
hour suddenly the broad and lines of the count face 
began to the the handsome mouth was drawn to one 
side  now did pierre how near death his father 
was and from that distorted mouth an indistinct sound anna 
mikhaylovna looked attentively at the man eyes trying to guess 
what he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to 
some drink then named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper 
then pointed to the the eyes and face of the 
man showed impatience he made an effort to look at 
the who stood constantly at the head of the bed 
  to turn on the other side whispered the 
and got up to turn the count heavy body toward 
the wall  pierre rose to help him  while 
the count was being turned over one of his arms 
fell back and he made a effort to pull it 
forward whether he noticed the look of with which pierre 
regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought across 
his dying at any rate he glanced at the arm 
at pierre face and again at the arm and on 
his face a piteous smile appeared quite out of keeping 
with his features that seemed to his own at sight 
of this smile pierre felt an quivering in his breast 
and a in his nose and tears his eyes the 
man was turned on to his side with his face 
to the wall he   is said anna mikhaylovna 
that one of the princesses was coming to take her 
turn at watching  us go  pierre went out 
     chapter   there was 
now no one in the reception room except prince vasili 
and the eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait 
of catherine the great and talking eagerly as soon as 
they saw pierre and his companion they became silent and 
pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she 
whispered   can bear the sight of that woman 
  has had tea served in the small drawing 
room said prince vasili to anna mikhaylovna  and take 
something my poor anna mikhaylovna or you will not hold 
out  to pierre he said nothing merely giving his 
arm a below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna 
into the small drawing room   is nothing so 
after a night as a cup of this russian tea 
lorrain was saying with an air of animation as he 
stood tea from a delicate cup before a table on 
which tea and a cold supper were laid in the 
small room around the table all who were at count 
bezukhov house that night had gathered to themselves pierre well 
remembered this small drawing room with its and little tables 
during balls given at the house pierre who did not 
know how to dance had liked sitting in this room 
to watch the ladies who as they passed through in 
their ball dresses with diamonds and on their bare shoulders 
looked at themselves in the lighted which repeated their reflections 
several times now this same room was lighted by two 
candles on one small table tea things and supper dishes 
stood in and in the middle of the night a 
of people sat there not but and betraying by every 
word and movement that they none of them forgot what 
was and what was about to happen in the pierre 
did not eat anything though he would very much have 
liked to he looked inquiringly at his and saw that 
she was again going on to the reception room where 
they had left prince vasili and the eldest princess pierre 
concluded that this also was essential and after a short 
followed her anna mikhaylovna was standing beside the princess and 
they were both speaking in   me princess to 
know what is necessary and what is not necessary said 
the younger of the two evidently in the same state 
of excitement as when she had the door of her 
room   my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna but 
blocking the way to the and the other from passing 
 this be too much for poor uncle at a 
moment when he conversation at a moment when his soul 
is already prepared  prince vasili was seated in an 
easy chair in his familiar attitude with one high above 
the other his which were so that they looked below 
were but he wore the air of a man little 
concerned in what the two ladies were saying   
my dear anna mikhaylovna let do as she you know 
how fond the count is of her   don 
even know what is in this paper said the younger 
of the two ladies addressing prince vasili and pointing to 
an she held in her hand  i know is 
that his real will is in his table and this 
is a paper he has forgotten  she tried to 
pass anna mikhaylovna but the latter so as to her 
path   know my dear kind princess said anna 
mikhaylovna the so firmly that it was plain she would 
not let go easily  princess i beg and you 
have some pity on him je vous  the princess 
did not reply their in the for the were the 
only sounds audible but it was evident that if the 
princess did speak her words would not be to anna 
mikhaylovna though the latter held on her voice lost none 
of its and softness   my dear come here 
i think he will not be out of place in 
a family is it not so prince   don 
you speak cousin suddenly the princess so loud that those 
in the drawing room heard her and were startled  
do you remain silent when heaven knows who herself to 
interfere making a scene on the very of a dying 
man room she and tugged with all her might at 
the  but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or 
two to keep her hold on the and changed her 
 prince vasili rose  said he with reproach and 
surprise  is absurd come let go i tell you 
 the princess let go   you too  
but anna mikhaylovna did not obey him   go 
i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself 
will go and ask him i does that you  
 prince said anna mikhaylovna  such a solemn allow 
him a moment peace here pierre tell them your opinion 
said she turning to the young man who having come 
quite close was gazing with at the angry face of 
the princess which had lost all dignity and at the 
of prince vasili   that you will answer for 
the said prince vasili severely  don know what you 
are doing   woman shouted the princess unexpectedly at 
anna mikhaylovna and snatching the from her  prince vasili 
bent his head and spread out his hands  at 
this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so 
long and which had always opened so quietly burst open 
and against the wall and the second of the three 
sisters rushed out her hands   are you doing 
she cried vehemently  is dying and you leave me 
alone with him  her sister dropped the anna mikhaylovna 
quickly caught up the object of and ran into the 
the eldest princess and prince vasili themselves followed her a 
few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a 
pale hard face again her at sight of pierre her 
expression showed an hatred   now you may be 
glad said she  is what you have been waiting 
for and into tears she hid her face in her 
handkerchief and rushed from the room  prince vasili came 
next he to the sofa on which pierre was sitting 
and dropped onto it his face with his hand pierre 
noticed that he was pale and that his quivered and 
shook as if in an   my friend said 
he taking pierre by the elbow and there was in 
his voice a and weakness pierre had never observed in 
it before  often we sin how much we and 
all for what i am near dear friend i too 
all will end in death all death is awful and 
he burst into tears  anna mikhaylovna came out last 
she approached pierre with quiet steps   she said 
 pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the 
young man on his forehead him with her tears then 
after a pause she said   is no more 
 pierre looked at her over his spectacles   
i will go with you try to nothing gives such 
relief as tears  she led him into the dark 
drawing room and pierre was glad no one could see 
his face anna mikhaylovna left him and when she returned 
he was fast with his head on his arm  
in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre   
my dear this is a great for us all not 
to speak of you but god will support you you 
are young and are now i hope in command of 
an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened 
i know you well enough to be sure that this 
will not turn your head but it duties on you 
and you must be a man  pierre was silent 
  later on i may tell you my dear 
boy that if i had not been there god only 
knows what would have happened you know uncle promised me 
only the day before yesterday not to forget boris but 
he had no time i hope my dear friend you 
will carry out your father wish  pierre understood nothing 
of all this and looked in silence at princess anna 
mikhaylovna after her talk with pierre anna mikhaylovna returned to 
the rostovs and went to bed on waking in the 
morning she told the rostovs and all her the of 
count bezukhov death she said the count had died as 
she would herself wish to die that his end was 
not only touching but as to the last meeting between 
father and son it was so touching that she could 
not think of it without tears and did not know 
which had behaved better during those awful moments father who 
so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken 
such pathetic words to the son or pierre whom it 
had been to see so was he with though he 
tried hard to hide it in order not to his 
dying father  is painful but it does one good 
it the soul to see such men as the old 
count and his worthy son said she of the behavior 
of the eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke but 
in and as a great secret     
 chapter   at bald hills prince nicholas bolkonski 
the arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was 
expected but this did not upset the regular of life 
in the old prince household general in chief prince nicholas 
 in society  king of prussia ever since the 
emperor had him to his country had lived there with 
his daughter princess mary and her companion mademoiselle though in 
the new he was free to return to the he 
still continued to live in the country that anyone who 
wanted to see him could come the hundred from moscow 
to bald hills while he himself no one and nothing 
he used to say that there are only two of 
human and and only two and intelligence he himself his 
daughter education and to these two in her gave her 
lessons in and till she was twenty and arranged her 
life so that her whole time was occupied he was 
himself always occupied his in higher turning on a in 
the garden or the building that was always going on 
at his as is a condition in his household was 
carried to the highest point of he always came to 
table under precisely the same and not only at the 
same hour but at the same minute with those about 
him from his daughter to his serfs the prince was 
sharp and so that without being a man he inspired 
such fear and respect as few men would have although 
he was in and had now no influence in political 
affairs every high official appointed to the in which the 
prince lay considered it his duty to visit him and 
waited in the lofty just as the or princess mary 
did till the prince appeared to the appointed hour everyone 
sitting in this experienced the same feeling of respect and 
even fear when the high study door opened and showed 
the figure of a rather small old man with small 
hands and gray eyebrows which when he frowned sometimes hid 
the gleam of his eyes  on the morning of 
the day that the young were to arrive princess mary 
entered the as usual at the time appointed for the 
morning greeting crossing herself with and repeating a silent every 
morning she came in like that and every morning that 
the interview might pass off well  an old who 
was sitting in the rose quietly and said in a 
whisper  walk in  through the door came the 
regular of a the princess timidly opened the door which 
moved and easily she paused at the entrance the prince 
was at the and after glancing round continued his work 
 the enormous study was full of things evidently in 
constant use the large table covered with and the tall 
glass with in the locks the high for while standing 
up on which lay an open exercise book and the 
with laid ready to hand and around indicated and the 
motion of the small foot in a embroidered with silver 
and the firm pressure of the hand showed that the 
prince still possessed the and of old age after a 
few more of the he removed his foot from the 
his dropped it into a attached to the and approaching 
the table his daughter he never gave his children a 
so he simply held out his  yet and regarding 
her tenderly and attentively said severely   well all 
right then sit down he took the exercise book lessons 
in written by himself and drew up a chair with 
his foot   tomorrow said he quickly finding the 
page and making a from one paragraph to another with 
his hard  the princess bent over the exercise book 
on the table   a bit here a letter 
for you said the old man suddenly taking a letter 
addressed in a woman hand from a bag hanging above 
the table onto which he threw it  at the 
sight of the letter red showed themselves on the princess 
face she took it quickly and bent her head over 
it   asked the prince with a cold smile 
that showed his still sound teeth   it from 
julie replied the princess with a timid glance and a 
timid smile   let two more pass but the 
third i read said the prince sternly  afraid you 
write much nonsense i read the third   this 
if you like father said the princess blushing still more 
and holding out the letter   third i said 
the third cried the prince pushing the letter away and 
his elbows on the table he drew toward him the 
exercise book   he began over the book close 
to his daughter and placing an arm on the back 
of the chair on which she sat so that she 
felt herself on all sides by the of old age 
and tobacco which she had known so long  these 
are equal please note that the angle  the princess 
looked in a scared way at her father eyes close 
to her the red on her face came and went 
and it was plain that she understood nothing and was 
so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any 
of her father further however clear they might be whether 
it was the teacher or the this same thing happened 
every day the princess eyes grew she could not see 
and could not hear anything but was only conscious of 
her stern father face close to her of his and 
the smell of him and could think only of how 
to get away quickly to her own room to make 
out the problem in peace the old man was beside 
himself moved the chair on which he was sitting backward 
and forward made to control himself and not become but 
almost always did become and sometimes the exercise book away 
 the princess gave a wrong answer   now 
isn she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book 
aside and turning away but rising immediately he up and 
down lightly touched his daughter hair and sat down again 
 he drew up his chair and continued to explain 
  won do princess it won do said he 
when princess mary having taken and closed the exercise book 
with the next day was about to leave  are 
most important i don want to have you like our 
silly ladies get used to it and you like it 
and he her  will drive all the nonsense out 
of your head  she turned to go but he 
stopped her with a gesture and took an book from 
the high   is some sort of key to 
the that your has sent you i don interfere with 
anyone i have looked at it take it well now 
go go  he her on the shoulder and himself 
closed the door after her  princess mary went back 
to her room with the sad scared expression that left 
her and which made her plain face yet she sat 
down at her table on which stood and which was 
with and papers the princess was as as her father 
was she put down the book and eagerly broke the 
of her letter it was from her most intimate friend 
from childhood that same julie karagina who had been at 
the rostovs name party  julie wrote in french  
 dear and precious friend how terrible and a thing 
is though i tell myself that half my life and 
half my happiness are wrapped up in you and that 
in spite of the distance us our hearts are by 
my heart against fate and in spite of the and 
around me i cannot a certain secret sorrow that has 
been in my heart ever since we why are we 
not together as we were last summer in your big 
study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa why cannot 
i now as three months ago draw fresh strength from 
your look so gentle calm and a look i loved 
so well and seem to see before me as i 
write   having read thus far princess mary and 
glanced into the mirror which stood on her right it 
reflected a weak figure and thin face her eyes always 
sad now looked with particular at her in the glass 
 me thought the princess turning away and continuing to 
read but julie did not her friend the princess eyes 
deep and  seemed as if at times there from 
them of warm light so beautiful that very often in 
spite of the plainness of her face they gave her 
an more powerful than that of beauty but the princess 
never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes look 
they had when she was not thinking of herself as 
with everyone her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as 
soon as she looked in a glass she went on 
reading   all moscow of nothing but war one 
of my two is already abroad the other is with 
the guards who are starting on their march to the 
our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought 
to his precious person to the of war god grant 
that the who is the peace of europe may be 
by the whom it has pleased the in his goodness 
to give us as sovereign to say nothing of my 
this war has me of one of the associations my 
heart i mean young nicholas rostov who with his enthusiasm 
could not bear to remain and has left the university 
to join the army i will confess to you dear 
mary that in spite of his extreme youth his for 
the army was a great to me this young man 
of whom i spoke to you last summer is so 
noble and full of that real which one finds among 
our old men of twenty and particularly he is so 
frank and has so much heart he is so and 
that my relations with him as they were have been 
one of the to my poor heart which has already 
so much i will tell you about our and all 
that was said then that is still too fresh ah 
dear friend you are happy not to know these joys 
and you are for the latter are generally the i 
know very well that count nicholas is too young ever 
to be more to me than a friend but this 
sweet friendship this and were what my heart but enough 
of this the chief news about which all moscow is 
the death of old count bezukhov and his fancy the 
three princesses have received very little prince vasili nothing and 
it is monsieur pierre who has all the property and 
has besides been recognized as so that he is now 
count bezukhov and of the fortune in russia it is 
that prince vasili played a very part in this affair 
and that he returned to petersburg quite  i confess 
i understand very little about all these matters of and 
but i do know that since this young man whom 
we all used to know as plain monsieur pierre has 
become count bezukhov and the of one of the in 
russia i am much amused to watch the change in 
the tone and manners of the by daughters and of 
the young ladies themselves toward him though between you and 
me he always seemed to me a poor sort of 
fellow as for the past two years people have amused 
themselves by finding husbands for me  of whom i 
don even know the matchmaking of moscow now speak of 
me as the future countess but you will understand that 
i have no desire for the post a propos of 
do you know that a while ago that anna mikhaylovna 
told me under the of of a plan of for 
you it is neither more nor less than with prince 
vasili son anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying 
him to someone rich and and it is on you 
that his relations choice has i don know what you 
will think of it but i consider it my duty 
to let you know of it he is said to 
be very handsome and a terrible that is all i 
have been able to find out about him  but 
enough of gossip i am at the end of my 
second of paper and mamma has sent for me to 
go and dine at the apraksins read the book i 
am sending you it has an enormous success here though 
there are things in it difficult for the human mind 
to it is an book which and the soul adieu 
give my to monsieur your father and my to mademoiselle 
i embrace you as i love you  julie  
let me have news of your brother and his charming 
little wife   the princess pondered with a thoughtful 
smile and her eyes lit up so that her face 
was entirely then she suddenly rose and with her heavy 
went up to the table she took a of paper 
and her hand moved rapidly over it this is the 
reply she wrote also in french   dear and 
precious friend your letter of the  has given me 
great so you still love me my julie of which 
you say so much that is bad does not seem 
to have had its usual effect on you you complain 
of our what then should i say if i dared 
complain i who am of all who are dear to 
me ah if we had not to console us life 
would be very sad why do you suppose that i 
should look severely on your affection for that young man 
on such matters i am only severe with myself i 
understand such in others and if never having felt them 
i cannot of them neither do i them only it 
seems to me that christian love love of one love 
of one is and better than the which the beautiful 
eyes of a young man can in a and young 
girl like yourself  the news of count bezukhov death 
reached us before your letter and my father was much 
affected by it he says the count was the last 
but one of the great century and that it is 
his own turn now but that he will do all 
he can to let his turn come as late as 
possible god us from that terrible  i cannot agree 
with you about pierre whom i knew as a child 
he always seemed to me to have an excellent heart 
and that is the i value most in people as 
to his and the part played by prince vasili it 
is very sad for both ah my dear friend our 
saviour words that it is for a to go through 
the eye of a needle than for a rich man 
to enter the of god are true i pity prince 
vasili but am still more sorry for pierre so young 
and with such what he will be exposed if i 
were asked what i desire most on earth it would 
be to be than the a thousand dear friend for 
the you have sent me and which has such success 
in moscow yet since you tell me that among some 
good things it others which our weak human understanding cannot 
it seems to me rather to spend time in reading 
what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i 
never could understand the some people have for their minds 
by on that merely their and their giving them a 
bent for quite contrary to christian let us rather read 
the and let us not to what they contain for 
how can we that we are know the terrible and 
secrets of while we remain in this which an between 
us and the let us rather ourselves to those which 
our saviour has left for our here below let us 
try to to them and follow them and let us 
be that the less we let our human minds roam 
the better we shall please god who all knowledge that 
does not come from him and the less we to 
what he has been pleased to from us the sooner 
will he its to us through his spirit  my 
father has not spoken to me of a but has 
only told me that he has received a letter and 
is expecting a visit from prince vasili in regard to 
this of for me i will tell you dear sweet 
friend that i look on as a to which we 
must however painful it may be to me should the 
lay the duties of wife and mother upon me i 
shall try to perform them as as i can without 
myself by my toward him whom he may give me 
for husband  i have had a letter from my 
brother who his arrival at bald hills with his wife 
this pleasure will be but a one however for he 
will leave us again to take part in this unhappy 
war into which we have been drawn god knows how 
or why not only where you are the heart of 
affairs and of the world the talk all of war 
even here amid and the calm of nature consider of 
the country of war are heard and felt my father 
of nothing but and things of which i understand nothing 
and the day before yesterday during my walk through the 
village i a scene it was a of from our 
people and starting to join the army you should have 
seen the state of the mothers and children of the 
men who were going and should have heard the it 
seems as though mankind has forgotten the of its saviour 
who preached love and forgiveness of that men the greatest 
to in one another  adieu dear and kind friend 
may our saviour and his most mother keep you in 
their and all care  mary    you 
are sending off a letter princess i have already mine 
i have written to my poor mother said the smiling 
mademoiselle rapidly in her pleasant tones and with r she 
brought into princess mary mournful and gloomy world a quite 
different careless and self   i must warn you 
she added lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself 
with pleasure and speaking with exaggerated  prince has been 
michael he is in a very bad very be prepared 
  dear friend replied princess mary  have asked 
you never to warn me of the my father is 
in i do not allow myself to judge him and 
would not have others do so  the princess glanced 
at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes 
late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into 
the sitting room with a look of alarm between twelve 
and two o as the day was out the prince 
rested and the princess played the clavichord    
  chapter   the gray was sitting listening 
to the of the prince who was in his large 
study from the far side of the house through the 
closed doors came the sound of difficult times repeated a 
by  just then a closed carriage and another with 
a drove up to the porch prince andrew got out 
of the carriage helped his little wife to and let 
her pass into the house before him old wearing a 
put his head out of the door of the in 
a whisper that the prince was and hastily closed the 
door knew that neither the son arrival nor any other 
must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the 
day prince andrew apparently knew this as well as he 
looked at his watch as if to whether his father 
had changed since he was at home last and having 
himself that they had not he turned to his wife 
  will get up in twenty minutes let us 
go across to mary room he said  the little 
princess had grown during this time but her eyes and 
her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to 
speak just as merrily and prettily as ever   
this is a she said to her husband looking around 
with the expression with which people compliment their host at 
a ball  come quick quick and with a glance 
round she smiled at at her husband and at the 
footman who accompanied them   that mary let go 
quietly and take her by surprise  prince andrew followed 
her with a but sad expression   grown older 
he said in passing to the old man who kissed 
his hand  before they reached the room from which 
the sounds of the clavichord came the pretty fair mademoiselle 
rushed out apparently beside herself with   what joy 
for the princess exclaimed she  last i must let 
her know   no please not you are mademoiselle 
said the little princess kissing her  know you already 
through my sister friendship for you she was not expecting 
us  they went up to the door of the 
sitting room from which came the sound of the passage 
of the prince andrew stopped and made a grimace as 
if expecting something unpleasant  the little princess entered the 
room the passage broke off in the middle a cry 
was heard then princess mary heavy and the sound of 
kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who 
had only met once before for a short time at 
his were in each other arms warmly pressing their lips 
to place they happened to touch mademoiselle stood near them 
pressing her hand to her heart with a smile and 
obviously ready to cry or to laugh prince andrew shrugged 
his shoulders and frowned as of music do when they 
hear a note the two women let go of one 
another and then as if afraid of being too late 
seized each other hands kissing them and pulling them away 
and again began kissing each other on the face and 
then to prince andrew surprise both began to cry and 
kissed again mademoiselle also began to cry prince andrew evidently 
felt ill at ease but to the two women it 
seemed quite natural that they should cry and apparently it 
never entered their heads that it could have been at 
this meeting   my dear ah mary they suddenly 
exclaimed and then laughed  last night were not expecting 
us  mary you have got  you have grown 
  knew the princess at once put in mademoiselle 
  i had no idea exclaimed princess mary  
andrew i did not see you  prince andrew and 
his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he 
told her she was still the same as ever princess 
mary had turned toward her brother and through her tears 
the warm gentle look of her large eyes very beautiful 
at that moment rested on prince andrew face  the 
little princess talked her short downy upper lip continually and 
rapidly touching her rosy lip when necessary and drawing up 
again next moment when her face broke into a smile 
of teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an they 
had had on the hill which might have been serious 
for her in her condition and immediately after that them 
that she had left all her clothes in petersburg and 
that heaven knew what she would have to dress in 
here and that andrew had quite changed and that had 
married an old man and that there was a for 
mary a real one but that they would talk of 
that later princess mary was still looking silently at her 
brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and 
sadness it was plain that she was following a train 
of thought of her sister words in the midst of 
a description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her 
brother   you are really going to the war 
andrew she said sighing  lise too   and 
even tomorrow replied her brother   is leaving me 
here god knows why when he might have had  
princess mary did not listen to the end but continuing 
her train of thought turned to her sister with a 
tender glance at her figure   it certain she 
said  the face of the little princess changed she 
and said  quite certain ah it is very dreadful 
 her lip she brought her face close to her 
sister and unexpectedly again began to cry   rest 
said prince andrew with a frown  you lise take 
her to your room and i go to father how 
is he just the same   just the same 
though i don know what your opinion will be answered 
the princess joyfully   are the hours the same 
and the in the and the asked prince andrew with 
a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that in spite of 
all his love and respect for his father he was 
aware of his   hours are the same and 
the and also the and my lessons said princess mary 
as if her lessons in were among the greatest of 
her life  when the twenty minutes had elapsed and 
the time had come for the old prince to get 
up came to call the young prince to his father 
the old man made a from his usual in honor 
of his son arrival he gave orders to admit him 
to his apartments while he dressed for dinner the old 
prince always dressed in old style wearing an coat and 
hair and when prince andrew entered his father room  
with the look and manner he wore in drawing rooms 
but with the animated face with which he talked to 
pierre the old man was sitting on a large chair 
wrapped in a mantle his head to   here 
the wants to buonaparte said the old man shaking his 
head as much as the tail which was holding fast 
to would allow   at least must him properly 
or else if he goes on like this he soon 
have us too for his how are you and he 
held out his  the old man was in a 
good after his nap before dinner  used to say

glances at his son from under his thick eyebrows prince 
andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot 
indicated to him he made no reply on his father 
favorite topic fun of the military men of the day 
and more particularly of bonaparte   father i have

smile that showed that his father did not prevent his 
son from and him  i have not yet had

shaking his to see whether it was firmly and his 
by the hand  house for your wife is ready

said he rising from his chair and pacing up and 
down the room followed by who ran after him him 
different of  of how will they cross  prince 
andrew seeing that his father began first reluctantly but gradually 
with more and more animation and from habit changing from 
russian to french as he went on explain the plan 
of for the coming he explained how an army thousand 
strong was to prussia so as to bring her out 
of her neutrality and draw her into the war how 
part of that army was to join some forces at 
how two hundred and twenty thousand with a hundred thousand 
russians were to in and on the how fifty thousand 
russians and as many english were to land at and 
how a force of five hundred thousand men was to 
attack the french from different sides the old prince did 
not the least interest during this but as if he 
were not listening to it continued to dress while about 
and three times unexpectedly interrupted once he stopped it by 
shouting  white one the white one  this meant 
that was not him the waistcoat he wanted another time 
he interrupted saying   will she soon be and 
shaking his head said  bad go on go on 
 the third came when prince andrew was finishing his 
description the old man began to sing in the cracked 
voice of old age  dieu     
      is going to the 
wars god knows when he      
return   his son only smiled   don 
say it a plan i of said the son  
am only telling you what it is napoleon has also 
formed his plan by now not worse than this one 
  you told me nothing new and the old 
man repeated and rapidly   go to the dining 
room      chapter   at 
the appointed hour the prince and entered the dining room 
where his daughter princess mary and mademoiselle were already awaiting 
him together with his who by a strange of his 
was to table though the position of that insignificant was 
such as could certainly not have him to expect that 
honor the prince who generally kept very to social and 
even important government to his table had unexpectedly michael  
always went into a corner to blow his nose on 
his checked handkerchief to the theory that all men are 
and had more than once on his daughter that michael 
was  a worse than you or i at dinner 
the prince usually spoke to the michael more often than 
to anyone else  in the dining room which like 
all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty the 
members of the household and the footmen behind each chair 
waiting for the prince to enter the head butler napkin 
on arm was the setting of the table making signs 
to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to 
the door by which the prince was to enter prince 
andrew was looking at a large frame new to him 
the tree of the bolkonski opposite which another such frame 
with a badly portrait  by the hand of the 
belonging to the of a prince in a of and 
of the prince andrew looking again at that tree shook 
his head laughing as a man who looks at a 
portrait so of the as to be amusing   
thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary 
who had come up to him  princess mary looked 
at her brother in surprise she did not understand what 
he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her 
with and was question   has his continued prince 
andrew  with his powerful mind in such nonsense  
princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brother 
and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were 
heard coming from the study the prince walked in quickly 
and jauntily as was his as if intentionally the of 
his manners with the of his house at that moment 
the great clock struck two and another with a tone 
joined in from the drawing room the prince stood still 
his lively eyes from under their thick eyebrows sternly scanned 
all present and rested on the little princess she felt 
as do when the the of fear and respect which 
the old man inspired in all around him he stroked 
her hair and then her awkwardly on the back of 
her neck   glad glad to see you he 
said looking attentively into her eyes and then quickly went 
to his place and sat down  down sit down 
sit down michael  he indicated a place beside him 
to his daughter a footman moved the chair for her 
  said the old man his eyes on her 
figure  been in a that bad  he laughed 
in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips 
only and not with his eyes   must walk 
walk as much as possible as much as possible he 
said  the little princess did not or did not 
wish to hear his words she was silent and seemed 
confused the prince asked her about her father and she 
began to smile and talk he asked about and she 
became still more animated and away giving him greetings from 
people and the town gossip   apraksina poor thing 
has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes 
out she said growing more and more lively  as 
she became animated the prince looked at her more and 
more sternly and suddenly as if he had studied her 
and had formed a definite idea of her he turned 
away and addressed michael   michael our bonaparte will 
be having a bad time of it prince andrew  
always spoke thus of his son  been telling me 
what forces are being against him while you and i 
never thought much of him  michael did not at 
all know when  and i had said such things 
about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a 
on which to the prince favorite topic he looked inquiringly 
at the young prince wondering what would follow   
is a great said the prince to his son pointing 
to the  and the conversation again turned on the 
war on bonaparte and the and of the day the 
old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men 
of the day were mere who did not know the 
a of war or of politics and that bonaparte was 
an insignificant little only because there were no longer any 
or suvorovs left to him but he was also convinced 
that there were no political difficulties in europe and no 
real war but only a sort of show at which 
the men of the day were playing to do something 
real prince andrew gaily bore with his father of the 
new men and drew him on and listened to him 
with evident pleasure   past always seems good said 
he  did not suvorov himself fall into a trap 
set him and from which he did not know how 
to escape   told you that who cried the 
prince  and he away his plate which briskly caught 
 consider prince andrew two and suvorov would have been 
a if suvorov had had a free hand but he 
had the on his hands it would have the devil 
himself when you get there you find out what those 
are suvorov couldn manage them so what has michael kutuzov 
no my dear boy he continued  and your won 
get on against buonaparte you have to call in the 
french so that birds of a feather may fight together 
the german has been sent to new in to the 
frenchman he said to the invitation made that year to 
to enter the russian service  were the suvorovs and 
no lad either you fellows have all lost your or 
i have mine may god help you but we see 
what will happen buonaparte has become a great commander among 
them   don at all say that all the 
are good said prince andrew  am only surprised at 
your opinion of bonaparte you may laugh as much as 
you like but all the same bonaparte is a great 
general   cried the old prince to the who 
busy with his roast meat he had been forgotten  
i tell you buonaparte was a great here he says 
the same thing   be sure your excellency replied 
the  the prince again laughed his frigid laugh  
 was born with a silver in his mouth he 
has got splendid soldiers besides he began by and only 
have failed to beat the since the world began everybody 
has the they beat no one one another he made 
his reputation them  and the prince began explaining all 
the which to him bonaparte had made in his and 
even in politics his son made no rejoinder but it 
was evident that were he was as little able as 
his father to change his opinion he listened from a 
reply and wondered how this old man living alone in 
the country for so many years could know and discuss 
so and all the military and political   think 
i an old man and don understand the present state 
of affairs concluded his father  it me i don 
sleep at night come now where has this great commander 
of yours shown his he concluded   would take 
too long to tell answered the son   then 
go to your buonaparte mademoiselle here another of that emperor 
of yours he exclaimed in excellent french   know 
prince i am not a   hummed the prince 
out of and with a laugh still more so he 
the table  the little princess during the whole and 
the rest of the dinner sat silent glancing with a 
frightened look now at her father and now at princess 
mary when they left the table she took her sister 
arm and drew her into another room   a 
clever man your father is said she  that is 
why i am afraid of him   he is 
so kind answered princess mary      
chapter   prince andrew was to leave next evening 
the old prince not altering his as usual after dinner 
the little princess was in her sister room prince andrew 
in a coat without had been with his in the 
rooms assigned to him after the carriage himself and seeing 
the put in he ordered the horses to be only 
those things he always kept with him remained in his 
room a small box a large with silver plate two 
turkish and a saber present from his father who had 
brought it from the of all these of prince andrew 
were in very good order new clean and in carefully 
tied with  when starting on a or changing their 
of life men capable of are generally in a serious 
frame of mind at such moments one the past and 
for the future prince andrew face looked very thoughtful and 
tender with his hands behind him he briskly from corner 
to corner of the room looking straight before him and 
shaking his head did he fear going to the war 
or was he sad at leaving his wife both but 
evidently he did not wish to be seen in that 
mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly his 
hands stopped at a table as if tying the of 
the small box and assumed his usual and expression it 
was the heavy of princess mary that he heard  
 hear you have given orders to she cried  
had apparently been running  i did so wish to 
have another talk with you alone god knows how long 
we may again be you are not angry with me 
for coming you have changed so she added as if 
to explain such a question  she smiled as she 
uttered his pet name  it was obviously strange to 
her to think that this stern handsome man should be 
slender boy who had been her in childhood   
where is lise he asked answering her question only by 
a smile   was so tired that she has 
on the sofa in my room oh andrew what a 
treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down 
on the sofa facing her brother  is quite a 
child such a dear merry child i have grown so 
fond of her  prince andrew was silent but the 
princess noticed the ironical and look that showed itself on 
his face   must be to little who is 
free from them andrew don forget that she has grown 
up and been educated in society and so her position 
now is not a rosy one we should enter into 
everyone situation  think what it must be for her 
poor thing after what she has been used to to 
be from her husband and be left alone in the 
country in her condition it very hard    
     to understand all is to 
forgive all   prince andrew smiled as he looked 
at his sister as we smile at those we think 
we thoroughly understand   live in the country and 
don think the life terrible he replied   that 
different why speak of me i don want any other 
life and can for i know no other but think 
andrew for a young society woman to be in the 
country during the best years of her life all alone 
papa is always busy and i well you know what 
poor i have for a woman used to the best 
society there is only mademoiselle   don like your 
mademoiselle at all said prince andrew   she is 
very nice and kind and above all she much to 
be pitied she has no one no one to tell 
the truth i don need her and she even in 
my way you know i always was a and now 
am even more so i like being alone father her 
very much she and michael are the two people to 
whom he is always gentle and kind because he has 
been a benefactor to them both as says  don 
love people so much for the good they have done 
us as for the good we have done them father 
took her when she was after losing her own father 
she is very good and my father her way of 
reading she to him in the and splendidly   
be quite frank mary i expect father character sometimes makes 
things trying for you doesn it prince andrew asked suddenly 
 princess mary was first surprised and then at this 
question   me for me trying for me said 
she   always was rather and now i should 
think he getting very trying said prince andrew apparently speaking 
lightly of their father in order to or test his 
sister   are good in every way andrew but 
you have a kind of intellectual pride said the princess 
following the train of her own thoughts rather than the 
of the conversation that a great sin how can one 
judge father but even if one might what feeling except 
could such a man as my father and i am 
so and happy with him i only wish you were 
all as happy as i am  her brother shook 
his head   only thing that is hard for 
me i will tell you the truth andrew is father 
way of treating i don understand how a man of 
his immense can to see what is as clear as 
day and can go so far that is the only 
thing that makes me unhappy but even in this i 
can see lately a of his has been less of 
late and there was a he received and had a 
long talk with   my dear i am afraid 
you and your are your said prince andrew yet tenderly 
  mon i only and hope that god will 
hear me andrew she said timidly after a moment silence

refuse it will give you no trouble and is nothing 
of you but it will me promise said she putting 
her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out 
what she was holding inside it as if what she 
held were the subject of her request and must not 
be shown before the request was  she looked timidly 
at her brother   if it were a great 
deal of trouble answered prince andrew as if what it 
was about   what you please i know you

joke had brought to his sister face he and added

you and bring you to himself for in him alone 
is truth and peace said she in a voice with 
solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a 
small dark of the saviour in a gold setting on 
a finely silver chain  she herself kissed the and 
it to andrew   andrew for my sake  
of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes those 
eyes lit up the whole of her thin face and 
made it beautiful her brother would have taken the but 
she stopped him andrew understood himself and kissed the there 
was a look of tenderness for he was touched but 
also a gleam of irony on his face   
you my dear she kissed him on the forehead and 
sat down again on the sofa they were silent for 
a while   i was saying to you andrew 
be kind and as you always used to be don 
judge lise she began  is so sweet so good 
and her position now is a very hard one  
 do not think i have of my wife to

was silent as if she felt guilty   have 
said nothing to you but you have already been talked 
to and i am sorry for that he went on 
 the grew deeper on her forehead neck and she 
tried to say something but could not her brother had 
guessed right the little princess had been crying after dinner 
and had spoken of her about her and how she 
it and had of her fate her father and her 
husband after crying she had prince andrew felt sorry for 
his sister   this i can reproach have not 
and never shall reproach my wife with anything and i 
cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her and 
that always will be so in circumstances i may be 
placed but if you want to know the truth if 
you want to know whether i am happy no is 
she happy no but why this is so i don 
know  as he said this he rose went to 
his sister and kissed her forehead his fine eyes lit 
up with a thoughtful kindly and brightness but he was 
looking not at his sister but over her head toward 
the of the open doorway   us go to 
her i must say good or and and i come 
in a moment he called to his  here take 
these away put this on the seat and this to 
the right  princess mary rose and moved to the 
door then stopped and said  if you had faith 
you would have turned to god and asked him to 
give you the love you do not feel and your 
would have been answered   may be said prince 
andrew  i come immediately  on the way to 
his sister room in the passage which connected one with 
the other prince andrew met mademoiselle smiling sweetly it was 
the third time that day that with an ecstatic and 
smile she had met him in   i thought 
you were in your room she said for some reason 
blushing and dropping her eyes  prince andrew looked sternly 
at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over 
his face he said nothing to her but looked at 
her forehead and hair without looking at her eyes with 
such that the blushed and went away without a word 
when he reached his sister room his wife was already 
and her merry voice hurrying one word after another came 
through the open door she was speaking as usual in 
french and as if after long self she wished to 
make up for lost time   but imagine the 
old countess with curls and her mouth full of teeth 
as if she were trying to old age mary  
this very sentence about countess and this same laugh prince 
andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence 
of others some five times he entered the room softly 
the little princess plump and rosy was sitting in an 
easy chair with her work in her hands talking repeating 
petersburg and even phrases prince andrew came up stroked her 
hair and asked if she felt rested after their she 
answered him and continued her chatter  the with six

little princess prince andrew had been called to his father

when prince andrew entered the study the old man in 
his old spectacles and white gown in which he received

glanced round   and he went on

touched his    do you thank me for

spluttered and  you have anything to say say it

stopped and as if not understanding fixed his stern eyes 
on his son   know that no one can

andrew evidently confused  know that out of a million 
only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and 
mine they have been telling her things she has had

to himself finishing what he was  do it

his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook 
it looked straight into his son face with eyes which

laugh  the son thus admitting that his father had 
understood him the old man continued to and his letter 
snatching up and down the the and the paper with 
his accustomed   to be done she pretty i

unexpectedly and then in a querulous voice suddenly  if

 they stood silent facing one another the old man 
sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son something in 
the lower part of the old prince face   
said good go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry 
voice opening his door   is it what asked 
both princesses when they saw for a moment at the 
door prince andrew and the figure of the old man 
in a white gown and shouting in an angry voice 
 prince andrew and made no reply   he 
said turning to his wife  and this  sounded 
coldly as if he were saying  go through your 
  already said the little princess turning pale and 
looking with dismay at her husband  he embraced her 
she screamed and fell on his shoulder  he the 
shoulder she leaned on looked into her face and carefully 
placed her in an easy chair   mary said 
he gently to his sister taking her by the hand 
and kissing her and then he left the room with 
steps  the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle 
her princess mary her sister still looked with her beautiful 
eyes full of tears at the door through which prince 
andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross 
in his direction from the study like came the sound 
of the old man angrily his nose hardly had prince 
andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the 
stern figure of the old man in the white gown 
looked out   that all right said he and 
looking angrily at the little princess he shook his head 
and the door      book two 
      chapter i   
in  a russian army was occupying the and of 
the of austria and yet other from russia were settling 
near the of and the on whom they were was 
the of the commander kutuzov  on   one 
of the infantry that had just reached had half a 
mile from the town waiting to be by the commander 
in chief despite the un appearance of the and stone 
and hills in the distance despite the fact that the 
 gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians 
the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment 
preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia 
 on the evening of the last day march an 
order had been received that the commander in chief would 
the regiment on the march though the words of the 
order were not clear to the commander and the question 
whether the were to be in order or not it 
was decided at a between the to present the regiment 
in order on the that it is always better to 
 too low than not bow low enough so the 
soldiers after a twenty march were kept and all night 
long without their eyes while the adjutants and company and 
and by morning the regiment of the crowd it had 
been on its last march the day before a well 
of two thousand men each of whom knew his place 
and his duty had every and every in place and 
shone with and not only was all in order but 
had it pleased the commander in chief to look under 
the he would have found on every man a clean 
shirt and in every the appointed number of  and 
all as the soldiers say there was only one which 
no one could be at ease it was the state 
of the soldiers more than half the men were in 
but this defect was not to any of the commander 
for in spite of repeated had not been by the 
and the regiment had some seven hundred  the commander 
of the regiment was an elderly stout and thick general 
with eyebrows and and from chest to back than across 
the shoulders he had on a uniform showing the where 
it had been and thick gold which seemed to stand 
rather than lie down on his shoulders he had the 
air of a man one of the most solemn duties 
of his life he walked about in front of the 
line and at every step pulled himself up slightly his 
back it was plain that the commander his regiment in 
it and that his whole mind was by it yet 
his seemed to indicate that besides military matters social interests 
and the fair occupied no small part of his thoughts 
  michael sir he said addressing one of the 
who smilingly pressed forward  was plain that they both 
felt happy  had our hands full last night however 
i think the regiment is not a bad one eh 
 the commander the irony and laughed   would 
not be turned off the field even on the  
 asked the commander  at that moment on the 
road from the town on which had been two men 
appeared on horse back they were an aide followed by 
a cossack  the aide was sent to the order 
which had not been clearly the day before that the 
commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in 
the state in which it had been on the march 
in their and and without any  a member of 
the from vienna had come to kutuzov the day before 
with and for him to join up with the army 
of the and and kutuzov not considering this meant among 
other in support of his to show the general the 
wretched state in which the arrived from russia with this 
object he intended to meet the regiment so the worse 
the condition it was in the better pleased the commander 
in chief would be though the aide did not know 
these circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the 
men should be in their and in order and that 
the commander in chief would be dissatisfied on hearing this 
the commander his head silently shrugged his shoulders and spread 
out his arms with a gesture   fine mess 
we made of it he remarked   now didn 
i tell you michael that if it was said  
the march it meant in said he to the commander 
 my god he added forward  he shouted in 
a voice accustomed to command  major how soon will 
he be here he asked the aide with a politeness 
evidently to the he was referring to   an 
hour time i should say   we have time 
to change clothes   don know general  the 
commander going up to the line himself ordered the soldiers 
to change into their the company ran off to their 
the major began bustling  were not in very good 
condition and instantly the squares that had up to then 
been in regular order and silent began to and and 
with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and 
fro up their with a of their shoulders and pulling 
the over their heads their and drawing the sleeves on 
with arms  in half an hour all was again 
in order only the squares had become gray instead of 
black the commander walked with his steps to the front 
of the regiment and examined it from a distance  
 is this this he shouted and stood still  
of the third company   of the third company 
wanted by the general commander to the general third company 
to the commander the words passed along the lines and 
an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer  
when the eager but words had reached their in a 
cry of  general to the third company the missing 
officer appeared from behind his company and though he was 
a middle man and not in the habit of running 
awkwardly stumbling on his toward the general the captain face 
showed the of a who is told to a he 
has not learned appeared on his nose the redness of 
which was evidently to and his mouth nervously the general 
looked the captain up and down as he came up 
his as he approached   will soon be your 
men in what is this shouted the commander forward his 
and pointing at a in the ranks of the third 
company in a of which with the others  have 
you been after the commander in chief is expected and 
you leave your place eh i you to dress the 
men in fancy for a eh  the commander of 
the company with his eyes fixed on his superior pressed 
two fingers more and more to his cap as if 
in this pressure lay his only hope of   
why don you speak whom have you got there dressed 
up as a said the commander with an   
excellency   your excellency what your excellency but what 
about your excellency knows   excellency it the officer 
dolokhov who has been to the ranks said the captain 
softly   has he been degraded into a field 
or into a if a he should be dressed in 
uniform like the others   excellency you gave him 
leave yourself on the march   him leave leave 
that just like you young men said the commander down 
a little  indeed one says a word to you 
and you what he added with irritation  beg you 
to dress your men  and the commander turning to 
look at the adjutant his steps down the line he 
was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and 
up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse 
for having at an officer for an badge at another 
because his line was not straight he reached the third 
company   are you standing where your your shouted 
the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice 
while there were still five men between him and dolokhov 
with his uniform  dolokhov slowly his bent knee looking 
straight with his clear insolent eyes in the general face 
  a blue coat off with it major change 
his coat the he did not finish   i 
must obey orders but i am not to endure dolokhov 
hurriedly interrupted   talking in the ranks no talking 
no talking   to endure dolokhov concluded in loud 
ringing tones  the eyes of the general and the 
met the general became silent angrily pulling down his scarf 
  request you to have the goodness to change 
your coat he said as he turned away   
   chapter ii    coming shouted 
the at that moment  the commander flushing ran to 
his horse seized the with hands threw his body across 
the himself drew his saber and with a happy and 
resolute countenance opening his mouth prepared to the regiment like 
a its and became   shouted the commander in 
a soul voice which expressed joy for himself severity for 
the regiment and for the approaching chief  along the 
broad country road on both sides by came a high 
light blue slightly on its and drawn by six horses 
at a behind the the and a of beside kutuzov 
sat an general in a white uniform that looked strange 
among the russian black ones the stopped in front of 
the regiment kutuzov and the general were talking in low 
voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as heavily he stepped down 
from the carriage just as if those two thousand men 
gazing at him and the commander did not exist  
the word of command rang out and again the regiment 
quivered as with a sound it arms then a dead 
silence the voice of the commander in chief was heard 
the regiment  to your and again all became silent 
at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved then 
he and the general in white accompanied by the walked 
between the ranks  from the way the commander the 
commander in chief and him with his eyes drawing himself 
up and from the way he walked through the ranks 
behind the bending forward and hardly able to restrain his 
movements and from the way he darted forward at every 
word or gesture of the commander in chief it was 
evident that he performed his duty as a with even 
greater than his duty as a commander to the and 
of its commander the regiment in with others that had 
reached at the same time was in splendid condition there 
were only  and everything was in good order except 
the  kutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to 
say a few friendly words to officers he had known 
in the turkish war sometimes also to the soldiers looking 
at their he several times shook his head sadly pointing 
them out to the general with an expression which seemed 
to say that he was not anyone but could not 
help noticing what a bad state of things it was 
the commander ran forward on each such occasion fearing to 
miss a single word of the commander in chief regarding 
the regiment behind kutuzov at a distance that allowed every 
softly spoken word to be heard followed some twenty men 
of his these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed 
of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome 
adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was his a 
tall staff officer stout with a kindly smiling handsome face 
and eyes could hardly keep from laughter by a hussar 
officer who walked beside him this hussar with a grave 
face and without a smile or a change in the 
expression of his fixed eyes watched the commander back and 
his every movement each time the commander started and bent 
forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the 
same manner laughed and the others to make them look 
at the  kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands 
of eyes which were starting from their to watch their 
chief on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped his 
not having expected this came closer to him   
said he the red captain who had been on account 
of the blue  one would have thought it impossible 
for a man to himself more than had done when 
he was by the commander but now that the commander 
in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such 
an that it seemed he could not have it had 
the commander in chief continued to look at him and 
so kutuzov who evidently understood his case and wished him 
nothing but good quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile 
over his and face   said he  officer 
are you satisfied with him he asked the commander  
and the latter that he was being reflected in the 
hussar officer as in a looking glass moved forward and 
answered  satisfied your excellency   all have our 
said kutuzov smiling and away from him  used to 
have a for  the commander was afraid he might 
be for this and did not answer the hussar at 
that moment noticed the face of the red captain and 
his drawn and his expression and with such that could 
not help laughing kutuzov turned round the officer evidently had 
complete control of his face and while kutuzov was turning 
managed to make a grimace and then a most serious 
deferential and innocent expression  the third company was the 
last and kutuzov pondered apparently trying to something prince andrew 
stepped forward from among the and said in french  
 told me to you of the officer dolokhov to 
the ranks in this regiment   is dolokhov asked 
kutuzov  dolokhov who had already changed into a gray 
did not wait to be called the shapely figure of 
the fair with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from 
the ranks went up to the commander in chief and 
arms   you a to make kutuzov asked with 
a slight frown   is dolokhov said prince andrew 
  said kutuzov  hope this will be a 
to you do your duty the emperor is gracious and 
i forget you if you deserve well  the clear 
blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as 
boldly as they had looked at the commander by their 
expression to tear open the of that a commander in 
chief so widely from a private   thing i 
ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firm ringing 
voice  ask an opportunity to for my and prove 
my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia 
 kutuzov turned away the same smile of the eyes 
with which he had turned from captain again over his 
face he turned away with a grimace as if to 
say that everything dolokhov had said to him and everything 
he could say had long been known to him that 
he was weary of it and it was not at 
all what he wanted he turned away and went to 
the carriage  the regiment broke up into which went 
to their appointed near where they to receive and clothes 
and to rest after their hard   won bear 
me a said the commander the third company on its 
way to its and up to captain who was in 
front  commander face now that the inspection was over 
beamed with  in the emperor service it can be 
helped one is sometimes a bit on i am the 
first to you know me he was very pleased and 
he held out his hand to the captain   
mention it general as if i be so bold replied 
the captain his nose growing redder as he gave a 
smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that 
had been out by the end of a at  
 tell dolokhov that i won forget him may be 
quite easy and tell me please been meaning to ask 
is he behaving himself and in general   far 
as the service goes he is quite your excellency but 
his character said   what about his character asked 
the commander   different on different days answered the 
captain  day he is sensible well educated and good 
and the next he a wild in if you please 
he nearly killed a   well well remarked the 
commander  one must have pity on a young man 
in you know he has important connections well then you 
just   will your excellency said showing by his 
smile that he understood his commander wish   of 
course of course  the commander out dolokhov in the 
ranks and in his horse said to him   
the next affair  dolokhov looked round but did not 
say anything nor did the smile on his lips change 
  that all right continued the commander  cup 
of for the men from me he added so that 
the soldiers could hear  thank you all god be 
and he past that company and overtook the next one 
  he really a good fellow one can serve 
under him said to the beside him   a 
word a hearty one said the laughing  commander was 
nicknamed king of hearts  the cheerful mood of their 
officers after the inspection the soldiers the company on gaily 
the soldiers voices could be heard on every side  
 they said kutuzov was of one eye   
so he is quite   friend he is than 
you are and he noticed everything   he looked 
at my feet friend well thinks i   that 
other one with him the looked as if he were 
with white as i suppose they him up as they

have to do another four without   it fine 
when those gave us you just sit still and are 
drawn along   here friend the people are quite 
there they all seemed to be under the russian here 
they all regular   to the front came the 
captain order  and from the different ranks some twenty 
men ran to the front a their turned round facing 
the and his arm began a long soldiers song with 
the words  the sun was rising and  then 
on to glory led by father this song had been 
in the turkish and now being in austria the only 
change being that the words  were replaced by  
kutuzov  having out these last words as soldiers do 
and waved his arms as if something to the ground 
the handsome of forty sternly at the and screwed up 
his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were 
fixed on him he raised both arms as if carefully 
lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and 
holding it there for some suddenly it down and began 
  my oh my   my new chimed 
in twenty voices and the in spite of the burden 
of his equipment rushed out to the front and before 
the company his shoulders and his as if threatening someone 
the soldiers their arms and keeping time with long steps 
behind the company the sound of wheels the of and 
the of horses were heard kutuzov and his were returning 
to the town the commander in chief made a sign 
that the men should continue to march at ease and 
he and all his showed pleasure at the sound of 
the and the sight of the dancing and the gay 
and men in the second from the right beside which 
the carriage passed the company a blue notice it was 
dolokhov with particular grace and boldness in time to the 
song and looking at those past as if he pitied 
all who were not at that moment with the company 
the hussar cornet of kutuzov who had the commander fell 
back from the carriage and up to dolokhov  hussar 
cornet had at one time in petersburg belonged to the 
wild set led by dolokhov had met dolokhov abroad as 
a private and had not seen fit to recognize him 
but now that kutuzov had spoken to the he addressed 
him with the of an old friend   dear 
fellow how are you said he through the making his 
horse keep with the company   am i dolokhov 
answered coldly  am as you see  the lively 
song gave a special to the tone of free and 
easy gaiety with which spoke and to the of dolokhov 
reply   how do you get on with the 
officers inquired   right they are good fellows and 
how have you onto the staff   was attached 
i on duty  both were silent   let 
the fly from her wide right sleeve went the song 
an involuntary of courage and their conversation would probably have 
been different but for the effect of that song  
 it true that have been asked dolokhov   
devil only knows they say so   glad answered 
dolokhov and clearly as the song demanded   say 
come round some evening and we have a game of 
said   have you too much money   
come   can i not to i won drink 
and won play till i get   that only 
till the first   shall see  they were 
again silent   if you need anything one can 
at least be of use on the staff  dolokhov 
smiled  trouble if i want anything i won beg 
take it   never mind i only   
i only     health    
       a long long 
way         to 
my land   touched his horse with the spurs 
it from foot to foot uncertain with which to start 
then settled down past the company and overtook the carriage 
still keeping time to the song     
 chapter iii   on returning from the kutuzov 
took the general into his private room and calling his 
adjutant asked for some papers to the condition of the 
on their arrival and the that had come from the 
who was in command of the army prince andrew bolkonski 
came into the room with the papers kutuzov and the 
member of the were sitting at the table on which 
a plan was spread out   said kutuzov glancing 
at bolkonski as if by this he was asking the 
adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation 
in french   i can say general said he 
with a pleasant of expression and intonation that one to 
listen to each deliberately spoken word it was evident that 
kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice  
i can say general is that if the matter on 
my wishes the will of his majesty the emperor would 
have been long ago i should long ago have joined 
the and believe me on my that to me personally 
it would be a pleasure to hand over the command 
of the army into the hands of a better and 
more general whom austria has so many to lay down 
all this heavy responsibility but circumstances are sometimes too strong 
for us general  and kutuzov smiled in a way 
that seemed to say  are quite at liberty not 
to believe me and i don even care whether you 
do or not but you have no for telling me 
so and that is the whole point  the general 
looked dissatisfied but had no but to reply in the 
same tone   the contrary he said in a 
querulous and angry tone that with his words  the 
contrary your excellency in the common is highly by his 
majesty but we think the present delay is the splendid 
russian and their commander of the they have been accustomed 
to in their he concluded his evidently sentence  kutuzov 
bowed with the same smile   that is my 
conviction and by the last letter with which his the 
has me i imagine that the under the direction of 
so a as general have by now already gained a 
and no longer need our said kutuzov  the general 
frowned though there was no definite news of an there 
were many circumstances the unfavorable that were and so kutuzov 
of an sounded much like irony but kutuzov went on 
smiling with the same expression which seemed to say that 
he had a right to suppose so and in fact 
the last letter he had received from army him of 
a and the position of the army was very  
 me that letter said kutuzov turning to prince andrew 
 have a look at it kutuzov with an ironical 
smile about the corners of his mouth read to the 
general the following passage in german from the letter  
 we have fully concentrated forces of nearly thousand men 
with which to attack and the should he cross the 
also as we are of we cannot be of the 
of both sides of the so that should the not 
cross the we can cross the throw ourselves on his 
line of the river lower down and his intention should 
he try to direct his whole force against our faithful 
we shall therefore the moment when the imperial russian army 
will be fully and shall then in with it easily 
find a way to prepare for the the fate he 
  kutuzov deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked 
at the member of the and attentively   you 
know the your excellency one to expect the said the 
general evidently wishing to have done with and to come 
to business he looked round at the aide   
me general interrupted kutuzov also turning to prince andrew  
here my dear fellow get from all the reports from 
our here are two from count and here is one 
from his the and here are these he said him 
several papers  a in french out of all this 
showing all the news we have had of the movements 
of the army and then give it to his excellency 
 prince andrew bowed his head in token of having 
understood from the first not only what had been said 
but also what kutuzov would have liked to tell him 
he gathered up the papers and with a bow to 
both stepped softly over the and went out into the 
waiting room  though not much time had passed since 
prince andrew had left russia he had changed greatly during 
that period in the expression of his face in his 
movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of 
his former affected languor and he now looked like a 
man who has time to think of the he makes 
on others but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work 
his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around 
him his smile and glance were and more attractive  
kutuzov whom he had in had received him very kindly 
promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other 
adjutants and had taken him to vienna and given him 
the more serious from vienna kutuzov wrote to his old 
prince andrew father   your son fair to become 
an officer distinguished by his industry and expedition i consider 
myself to have such a by me   on 
kutuzov staff among his fellow officers and in the army 
generally prince andrew had as he had had in petersburg 
society two quite opposite some a him to be different 
from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of 
him listened to him and him and with them prince 
andrew was natural and pleasant others the him and considered 
him cold and disagreeable but among these people prince andrew 
knew how to take his stand so that they respected 
and even feared him  coming out of kutuzov room 
into the waiting room with the papers in his hand 
prince andrew came up to his the aide on duty 
who was sitting at the window with a book  
 prince asked   am ordered to write a 
explaining why we are not   why is it 
 prince andrew shrugged his shoulders   news from 
    it were true that he has 
been news would have come   said prince andrew 
moving toward the outer door  but at that instant 
a tall general in a with the order of on 
his neck and a black round his head who had 
evidently just arrived entered quickly the door prince andrew stopped 
short   in chief kutuzov said the newly arrived 
general speaking quickly with a german accent looking to both 
sides and straight toward the inner door   commander 
in chief is engaged said going hurriedly up to the 
general and blocking his way to the door  shall 
i announce  the general looked disdainfully down at who 
was rather short as if surprised that anyone should not 
know him   commander in chief is engaged repeated 
 the general face clouded his lips quivered and trembled 
he took out a hurriedly something in out the gave 
it to stepped quickly to the window and threw himself 
into a chair gazing at those in the room as 
if asking  do they look at me then he 
lifted his head his neck as if he intended to 
say something but immediately with affected indifference began to to 
himself a queer sound which immediately broke off the door 
of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the 
doorway the general with the head bent forward as though 
running away from some danger and making long quick with 
his thin legs went up to kutuzov   le 
he uttered in a broken voice  kutuzov face as 
he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly for a 
few moments then wrinkles ran over his face like a 
and his forehead became again he bowed his head respectfully 
closed his eyes silently let enter his room before him 
and closed the door himself behind him  the report 
which had been that the had been and that the 
whole army had at to be correct within half an 
hour adjutants had been sent in directions with orders which 
showed that the russian who had been would also soon 
have to meet the  prince andrew was one of 
those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the 
general progress of the war when he saw and heard 
the of his he understood that half the was lost 
understood all the difficulties of the russian army position and 
imagined what it and the part he would have to 
play he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of 
the humiliation of austria and that in a week time 
he might perhaps see and take part in the first 
russian with the french since suvorov met them he feared 
that bonaparte might all the courage of the russian and 
at the same time could not admit the idea of 
his hero being  and by these thoughts prince andrew 
went toward his room to write to his father to 
whom he wrote every day in the he met with 
whom he a room and the they were as usual 
laughing   are you so asked noticing prince andrew 
pale face and eyes   nothing to be gay 
about answered bolkonski  just as prince andrew met and 
there came toward them from the other end of the 
an general who on kutuzov staff in of the of 
the russian army and the member of the who had 
arrived the previous evening there was room enough in the 
wide for the to pass the three officers quite easily 
but pushing aside with his arm said in a voice 
  coming they coming stand aside make way please 
make way  the were passing by looking as if 
they wished to avoid attentions on the face of the 
there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of which he seemed 
unable to suppress   excellency said he in german 
forward and addressing the general  have the honor to 
congratulate you  he bowed his head and scraped first 
with one foot and then with the other awkwardly like 
a child at a dancing  the member of the 
looked at him severely but seeing the of his stupid 
smile could not but give him a moment attention he 
screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening  
 have the honor to congratulate you general has arrived 
quite well only a little just here he added pointing 
with a beaming smile to his head  the general 
frowned turned away and went on    said 
he angrily after he had gone a few steps  
        god what 
  with a laugh threw his arms round prince 
andrew but bolkonski turning still pushed him away with an 
angry look and turned to the nervous irritation by the 
appearance of the news of his and the thought of 
what lay before the russian army found in anger at 
  you sir choose to make a of yourself 
he said with a slight of the lower  can 
prevent your doing so but i warn you that if 
you to play the fool in my presence i will 
you to behave yourself  and were so surprised by 
this outburst that they gazed at bolkonski silently with wide 
eyes   the matter i only them said  
 am not with you please be silent cried bolkonski 
and taking arm he left who did not know what 
to say   what the matter old fellow said 
trying to soothe him   the matter exclaimed prince 
andrew standing still in his excitement  you understand that 
either we are officers serving our and our country in 
the and at the of our common cause or we 
are merely who care nothing for their business l de 
vous la le  he said as if his views 
by this french sentence  un de comme vous un 
vous vous  only a could himself in this way 
he added in russian pronouncing the word with a french 
accent noticed that could still hear him    
      thousand men and the 
army of our      destroyed and 
you find that a cause for     
     is all very well for 
that good fellow      of whom 
you have made a friend but not for you not 
for      you   he 
waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer 
but he turned and went out of the   
   chapter iv   the pavlograd hussars 
were two from the in which nicholas rostov served as 
a cadet was in the german village of the best 
in the village were assigned to cavalry the commander known

morning from a expedition rostov in his cadet uniform with 
a to his horse up to the porch swung his

in the as if to part from his horse and 
at last down and called to his   dear

the horse  him up and down my dear fellow 
he continued with that gay which young people show to 
everyone when they are happy   your excellency answered 
the gaily tossing his head   walk him up 
and down well  another hussar also rushed toward the 
horse but had already thrown the of the over the 
horse head it was evident that the cadet was with 
his tips and that it paid to serve him rostov 
the horse neck and then his and lingered for a 
moment   what a horse he will be he 
thought with a smile and holding up his saber his 
spurs he ran up the steps of the porch his 
who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap in hand 
was from the looked out and his face immediately brightened 
on seeing rostov   he said winking with a 
merry smile evidently pleased to the young man   
      very good morning a 
very good morning     said rostov with 
the same gay smile which did not leave his eager 
face  alexander  said he quoting words often repeated 
by the german        
 already         
for the for the russians      
for emperor alexander   the german laughed came out 
of the pulled off his cap and it above his 
head cried   die      
    for the whole world   
rostov waved his cap above his head like the german 
and cried laughing  die though neither the german his 
nor rostov back with his from for had any reason 
for they looked at each other with joyful and love 
their heads in token of their affection and smiling the 
german returning to his and rostov going to the he 
occupied with   about your he asked whom all

the window and saw coming home was a small man 
with a red face sparkling black eyes and black mustache 
and hair he wore an unfastened cloak wide breeches hanging 
down in and a on the back of his head 
he came up to the porch hanging his head  
 he shouted loudly and angrily  it off

answered rostov  have already been for the and have 
seen   and i been losing i lost yesterday 
like a fool cried not pronouncing his r  ill

began and went on there tea  puckering up his 
face though smiling and showing his short strong teeth he 
began with fingers of both hands to ruffle up his 
thick black hair   what devil made me go 
to that  officer nicknamed  he said rubbing his 
forehead and whole face with both hands  fancy he 
didn let me a single not one  he took 
the lighted pipe that was offered to him it in 
his and it on the floor making the fly while 
he continued to   one the and it as 
soon as one it gives the and the  he 
the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away 
then he remained silent for a while and all at 
once looked with his black eyes at rostov   
at least we had some women here but there nothing 
one to do but if we could only get to 
soon who there he said turning to the door as 
he heard a of heavy and the of spurs that 
came to a stop and a cough   said 
 face puckered still more   he muttered down

watched movements and when the latter threw up his arms 
in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found glanced 
at rostov   you not been playing  rostov 
felt fixed on him raised his eyes and instantly dropped 
them again all the blood which had seemed somewhere below 
his rushed to his face and eyes he could not 
draw   there hasn been anyone in the room

threatening gesture  the purse isn found i you i

the shoulders and him against the wall   let

and neck stood out like  are mad i tell

him  but rostov pulled away his arm and with 
as much anger as though were his firmly fixed his 
eyes on his face   you understand what you 
saying he said in a voice  was no one 
else in the room except myself so that if it 
is not so then  he could not finish and 
ran out of the room   may the devil 
take you and were the last words rostov heard  
rostov went to   is not in he gone 
to said  something happened he added surprised at the 
cadet face   nothing   only just him 
said the  the were two away from and rostov 
without returning home took a horse and there there was 
an in the village which the officers rostov up to 
it and saw horse at the porch  in the 
second room of the the lieutenant was sitting over a 
dish of and a bottle of wine   you 
come here too young man he said smiling and raising 
his eyebrows   said rostov as if it cost 
him a great deal to utter the word and he 
sat down at the table  both were silent there 
were two and a russian officer in the room no 
one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter 
of knives and the of the lieutenant  when had 
finished his he took out of his a purse and 
drawing its rings aside with his small white turned fingers 
drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave 
it to the   be quick he said  
the was a new one rostov rose and went up 
to   me to look at your purse he 
said in a low almost voice  with eyes but 
eyebrows still raised him the purse   it a 
nice purse yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and 
added  at it young man  rostov took the 
purse in his hand examined it and the money in 
it and looked at the lieutenant was looking about in 
his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry 
  we get to vienna i get rid of 
it there but in these wretched little there nowhere to 
spend it said he  let me have it young 
man i going  rostov did not speak   
you are you going to have too they you quite 
here continued  then let me have it  he 
out his hand to take hold of the purse rostov 
let go of it took the purse and began slipping 
it into the of his breeches with his eyebrows lifted 
and his mouth slightly open as if to say  
yes i am putting my purse in my and that 
quite simple and is no one else business   
young man he said with a sigh and from under 
his lifted brows he glanced into rostov eyes  some 
as of an electric from eyes to rostov and back 
and back again and again in an instant   
here said rostov hold of arm and almost him to 
the window  money is you took it he whispered 
just above   what how you what said  
but these words came like a piteous cry and an 
entreaty for as soon as rostov heard them an enormous 
of doubt fell from him he was glad and at 
the same instant began to pity the man who stood 
before him but the task he had had to be 
  only knows what the people here may imagine 
muttered taking up his cap and moving toward a small 
empty room  must have an   know it 
and shall prove it said rostov    every 
muscle of pale terrified face began to his eyes still 
from side to side but with a downward look not 
rising to rostov face and his were audible   
don a young fellow here is this wretched money take 
it he threw it on the table  have an 
old father and mother  rostov took the money eyes 
and went out of the room without a word but 
at the door he stopped and then his steps  
god he said with tears in his eyes  could 
you do it   said drawing nearer to him 
  touch me said rostov drawing back  you 
need it take the money and he threw the purse 
to him and ran out of the    
  chapter v   that same evening there 
was an animated among the officers in   i 
tell you rostov that you must to the colonel said 
a tall staff captain with enormous and many wrinkles on 
his large features to rostov who was crimson with excitement 
 the staff captain had twice been to the ranks 
for affairs of honor and had twice his   
will allow no one to call me a cried rostov 
 told me i and i told him he and 
there it he may keep me on duty every day 
or may place me under but no one can make 
me because if he as commander of this regiment thinks 
it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then  
 just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen 
interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass stroking his 
long mustache  tell the colonel in the presence of 
other officers that an officer has   not to 
that the conversation began in the presence of other officers 
perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them but 
i am not a diplomatist that why i joined the 
hussars thinking that here one would not need and he 
tells me that i am lying let him give me 
satisfaction   all right no one thinks you a 
but that not the point ask whether it is not 
out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction 
of his commander  sat his mustache and listening to 
the conversation evidently with no wish to take part in 
it he answered the staff captain question by a of 
his head   speak to the colonel about this 
business before other officers continued the staff captain   
colonel was called  you up   did not 
me up he said i was telling an   
have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense 
to him and must   on any account exclaimed 
rostov   did not expect this of you said 
the staff captain seriously and severely  don wish to 
but man it not only to him but to the 
whole regiment of us to all round the case is 
this you ought to have thought the matter over and 
taken advice but no you go and it all straight 
out before the officers now what was the colonel to 
do have the officer tried and the whole regiment the 
whole regiment because of one is that how you look 
at it we don see it like that and was 
a he told you you were saying what was not 
true it not pleasant but what to be done my 
dear fellow you yourself in it and now when one 
wants to the thing over some your and you wish 
to make the whole affair public you are offended at 
being put on duty a bit but why not to 
an old and honorable officer may be he is an 
honorable and old colonel you quick at taking but you 
don mind the whole regiment the staff captain voice began 
to  have been in the regiment next to no 
time my lad you here today and tomorrow you be 
appointed adjutant somewhere and can your fingers when it is 
said  are among the pavlograd officers but it not 
all the same to us am i not right it

the staff captain  we old fellows who have grown

regiment we the honor of the regiment and knows it 
oh we do it old fellow and all this is 
not right it not right you may take or not 
but i always stick to mother truth it not right 
 and the staff captain rose and turned away from 
rostov   devil take it shouted up  then 
now then   rostov growing red and pale looked 
first at one officer and then at the other  
 gentlemen no you think i quite understand you wrong 
to think that of me i for me for the 
honor of the regiment i ah well i show that 
in and for me the honor of the flag well

staff captain beginning to rostov by his as if in 
of his  and your excellency yes go

the over the  and  on  the russian 
were crossing the river at the russian train the and 
of were through the town of on both sides of 
the bridge  it was a warm day the wide 
that opened out before the on which the russian stood 
the bridge was at times veiled by a of rain 
and then suddenly spread out in the far could be 
clearly seen as though down below the little town could 
be seen with its white red its and its bridge 
on both sides of which of russian at the of 
the an island and a with a park by the 
of the of the and the became visible and the 
left bank of the covered with with a of green 
and the of a stood out a wild forest and 
far away on the other side of the the horse 
could be discerned  among the field on the of 
the hill the general in command of the stood with 
a staff officer the country through his a little behind 
them who had been sent to the by the commander 
in chief was sitting on the of a carriage a 
cossack who accompanied him had him a and a and 
was treating some officers to and real the officers gathered 
round him some on their knees some turkish fashion on 
the grass   the prince who built that was 
no fool it a fine place why are you not 
anything gentlemen was saying   you very much prince 
answered one of the officers pleased to be talking to 
a staff officer of such importance  a lovely place 
we passed close to the park and saw two and 
what a splendid house   prince said another who 
would have liked to take another but felt shy and 
therefore pretended to be the our have already got there 
look there in the behind the village three of them 
are something they that he remarked with evident approval  
 they will said  but what i should like 
added he a in his handsome mouth  be to 
slip in over there  he pointed with a smile 
to a and his eyes and   would be 
fine gentlemen  the officers laughed   to the 
a bit they say there are italian girls among them 
on my word i give five years of my life 
for it   must be feeling dull too said 
one of the officers laughing  meanwhile the staff officer 
standing in front pointed out something to the general who 
looked through his field glass   so it is 
so it is said the general angrily lowering the field 
glass and shrugging his shoulders  it is they be 
on at the crossing and why are they there  
on the opposite side the could be seen by the 
eye and from their a milk cloud then came the 
report of a and our could be seen hurrying to 
the crossing  rose and went up to the general 
smiling   not your excellency like a little he 
said   a bad business said the general without 
answering him  men have been time   i 
better ride over your excellency asked   please do 
answered the general and he repeated the order that had 
already once been given in  tell the hussars that 
they are to cross last and to fire the bridge 
as i ordered and the material on the bridge must 
be   good answered  he called the cossack 
with his horse told him to put away the and 
and swung his heavy person easily into the   
really call in on the he said to the officers 
who watched him smilingly and he off by the path 
down the hill   then let see how far 
it will carry captain just try said the general turning 
to an officer  a little fun to pass the 
time   to your the officer  in a 
moment the men came running gaily from their and began 
  came the command  number one jumped briskly 
aside the rang out with a and a above the 
heads of our below the hill and fell far short 
of the a little smoke showing the spot where it 
burst  the faces of officers and men brightened up 
at the sound everyone got up and began watching the 
movements of our below as plainly visible as if but 
a stone throw away and the movements of the approaching 
farther off at the same instant the sun came fully 
out from behind the and the clear sound of the 
and the of the bright in a single joyous and 
     chapter vii   two 
of the had already across the bridge where there was 
a crush halfway across stood prince who had from his 
horse and whose big body was against the he looked 
back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps 
behind him holding two horses by their each time prince 
tried to move on soldiers and pushed him back again 
and pressed him against the and all he could do 
was to smile   a fine fellow you are 
friend said the cossack to a with a who was 
pressing onto the who were crowded together close to his 
wheels and his horses  a fellow you can wait 
a moment don you see the general wants to pass 
 but the took no notice of the word  
and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way 
 there boys keep to the left wait a bit 
but the soldiers crowded together shoulder to shoulder their moved 
over the bridge in a looking down over the prince 
saw the little waves of the which and round the 
of the bridge each other along looking on the bridge 
he saw uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder covered long 
and under the faces with broad and listless tired expressions 
and feet that moved through the that covered the of 
the bridge sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like 
a of white on the waves of the an officer 
in a cloak and with a type of face different 
from that of the men his way along sometimes like 
a of wood in the river an hussar on foot 
an or a was carried through the waves of infantry 
and sometimes like a down the river an officers or 
company high covered and in on all sides moved across 
the bridge   as if a had burst said 
the cossack  there many more of you to come 
  million all but one replied a in a 
coat with a and passed on followed by another an 
old man   he  meant the  at 
the bridge now said the old to a  forget 
to yourself  that passed on and after him came 
another sitting on a   the devil have the 
been to said an running behind the and in the 
back of it  and he also passed on with 
the then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been 
drinking   then old fellow he gives him one 
in the teeth with the end of his a whose 
was well tucked up said gaily with a wide swing 
of his arm   the was just answered another 
with a loud laugh and they too passed on so 
that did not learn who had been struck on the 
teeth or what the had to do with it  
 how they he just a ball and they think 
they all be killed a was saying angrily and  
 it past me the ball i mean said a 
young with an enormous mouth hardly from laughing  felt 
like dying of i did  my word i got 
that frightened said he as if bragging of having been 
frightened  that one also passed then followed a unlike 
any that had gone before it was a german with 
a pair of horses led by a german and seemed 
with a whole of a fine with a large was 
attached to the behind a woman with an baby an 
old woman and a german girl with bright red were 
sitting on some feather evidently these were allowed to pass 
by special the eyes of all the soldiers turned toward 
the women and while the was passing at foot all 
the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones every 
face bore almost the same smile expressing thoughts about the 
women   see the german is making too  
 me the said another addressing the german who angry 
and frightened strode along with eyes   how she 
made herself oh the   you should be on 
them   have seen as much before now  
 are you going asked an infantry officer who was 
an also half smiling as he looked at the handsome 
girl  the german closed his eyes that he did 
not understand   it if you like said the 
officer giving the girl an  the girl smiled and 
took it like the rest of the men on the 
bridge did not take his eyes off the women till 
they had passed when they had gone by the same 
stream of soldiers followed with the same kind of talk 
and at last all stopped as often happens the horses 
of a became at the end of the bridge and 
the whole crowd had to wait   why are 
they stopping there no proper order said the soldiers  
are you to devil take you can you wait it 
be worse if he the bridge see here an officer 
in too voices were saying in the crowd as the 
men looked at one another and all pressed toward the 
from the bridge  looking down at the of the 
under the bridge suddenly heard a sound new to him 
of something swiftly approaching something big that into the water 
  see where it to a near by said 
sternly looking round at the sound   us to 
get along said another uneasily  the crowd moved on 
again realized that it was a ball   cossack 
my horse he said  then you there get out 
of the way make way  with great difficulty he 
managed to get to his horse and shouting continually he 
moved on the soldiers themselves to make way for him 
but again pressed on him so that they his and 
those him were not to for they were themselves pressed 
still from behind   you came a voice from 
behind him  looked round and saw some fifteen away 
but by the living of moving infantry red and with 
his cap on the back of his black head and 
a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder   these 
these to let me pass shouted evidently in a fit 
of his eyes with their and rolling as he waved 
his saber in a small bare hand as red as 
his face   joyfully replied  up with you 
  can pass shouted showing his white teeth and 
his black which its ears as the touched it and 
white from his bit the of the bridge with his 
and apparently ready to jump over the had his let 
him  is this they like just like out of 
the way let us pass stop there you devil with 
the i you with my saber he shouted drawing his 
saber from its and it  the soldiers crowded against 
one another with terrified faces and joined   it 
you not drunk today said when the other had up 
to him   don even give one time to 
answered  keep the to and all day if they 
mean to fight let fight but the devil knows what 
this is   a you are today said looking 
at new cloak and  smiled took out of his 
a handkerchief that a smell of and put it to 
nose   course i going into i my teeth 
and scented myself  the figure of followed by his 
cossack and the of who his sword and shouted had 
such an effect that they managed to through to the 
farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry beside 
the bridge found the colonel to whom he had to 
the order and having done this he back  having 
the way stopped at the end of the bridge holding 
in his that was and the ground eager to its 
fellows he watched his draw nearer then the of as 
of several horses on the of the bridge and the 
officers in front and men four spread across the bridge 
and began to on his side of it  the 
infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in 
the and gazed with that particular feeling of ill and 
with which of different arms usually one another at the 
clean hussars who moved past them in regular order  
 only fit for a fair said one   
good are they they led about just for show remarked 
another   up the dust you infantry an hussar 
whose horse had over some foot soldiers   like 
to put you on a two days march with a 
your fine would soon get a bit rubbed said an 
wiping the off his face with his sleeve  up 
there you more like a than a man   
now they ought to put you on a horse you 
look fine said a a thin little who bent under 
the weight of his   a stick between your 
legs that suit you for a horse the hussar shouted 
back      chapter viii   
the last of the infantry hurriedly the bridge together as 
they approached it as if passing through a at last 
the had all the crush was less and the last 
came onto the bridge only of hussars remained on the 
farther side of the bridge facing the who could be 
seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was 
not yet visible from the bridge for the as seen 
from the valley through which the river was formed by 
the rising ground only half a mile away at the 
foot of the hill lay over which a few groups 
of our cossack were moving suddenly on the road at 
the top of the high ground and in blue uniform 
were seen these were the french a group of cossack 
down the hill at a all the officers and men 
of though they tried to talk of other things and 
to look in other directions thought only of what was 
there on the and kept constantly looking at the on 
the which they knew to be the the weather had 
again since and the sun was upon the and the 
dark hills around it it was calm and at the 
calls and the shouts of the could be heard from 
the hill there was no one now between the and 
the except a few an empty space of some seven 
hundred was all that them the ceased and that stern 
threatening and line which two was all the more clearly 
felt   step that line which the line the 
living from the dead lies suffering and death and what 
is there who is there that field that tree that 
lit up by the sun no one knows but one 
wants to know you fear and yet long to cross 
that line and know that sooner or later it must 
be and you will have to find out what is 
there just as you will have to learn what lies 
the other side of death but you are strong cheerful 
and and are by other such animated and men so 
thinks or at any rate anyone who comes in sight 
of the and that feeling gives a particular glamour and 
glad of to everything that takes place at such moments 
 on the high ground where the was the smoke 
of a rose and a ball over the heads of 
the hussar the officers who had been standing together off 
to their places the hussars began carefully their horses silence 
fell on the whole all were looking at the in 
front and at the commander awaiting the word of command 
a second and a third ball past evidently they were 
at the hussars but the balls with over the heads 
of the and fell somewhere them the hussars did not 
look round but at the sound of each as at 
the word of command the whole with its rows of 
faces so alike yet so different holding its while the 
ball past rose in the and back again the soldiers 
without turning their heads glanced at one another to see 
their comrades every face from to that of the showed 
one common expression of irritation and excitement around and mouth 
the frowned looking at the soldiers as if threatening to 
them cadet every time a ball past rostov on the 
left on his handsome horse despite its game the happy 
air of a called up before a large audience for 
an in which he sure he will distinguish himself he 
was glancing at everyone with a clear bright expression as 
if asking them to notice how he sat under fire 
but despite himself on his face too that same indication 
of something new and stern showed round the mouth  
 that there cadet that not look at me cried 
who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning 
his horse in front of the  the black face 
of and his whole short figure with the hand and 
fingers in which he held the of his saber looked 
just as it usually did especially toward evening when he 
had his second bottle he was only redder than usual 
with his head thrown back like birds when they drink 
pressing his spurs into the sides of his good horse 
and sitting as though falling in the he to the 
other of the and shouted in a voice to the 
men to look to their he up to the staff 
captain on his broad steady came at a walk to 
meet him his face with its long mustache was serious 
as always only his eyes were than usual   
what about it said he to  won come to 
a fight you see shall retire   devil only 
knows what they about muttered  he cried noticing the 
cadet bright face  got it at last  and 
he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov felt 
perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge 
up to him   excellency let us attack them 
i them off   indeed said the colonel in 
a bored voice puckering up his face as if off 
a fly  why are you stopping here don you 
see the are lead the back  the the bridge 
and drew out of of fire without having lost a 
single man the second that had been in the front 
line followed them across and the last the farther side 
of the river  the two pavlograd having the bridge 
up the hill one after the other their colonel came 
up to and at a not far from rostov without 
taking any notice of him although they were now meeting 
for the first time since their rostov feeling that he 
was at the front and in the power of a 
man toward whom he now that he had been to 
did not lift his eyes from the colonel back his 
covered with light hair and his red neck it seemed 
to rostov that was only not to notice him and 
that his whole aim now was to test the cadet 
courage so he drew himself up and looked around him 
merrily then it seemed to him that so near in 
order to show him his courage next he thought that 
his would send the on a desperate attack just to 
him then he imagined how after the attack would come 
up to him as he lay and would the hand 
of  the high figure of familiar to the as 
he had but recently left their regiment up to the 
colonel after his from had not remained in the regiment 
saying he was not such a fool as to slave 
at the front when he could get more by doing 
nothing on the staff and had succeeded in himself as 
an officer to prince he now came to his former 
chief with an order from the commander of the  
 he said addressing rostov with an air of gloomy 
gravity and glancing round at his comrades  is an 
order to stop and fire the bridge   order 
to who asked the colonel   don myself know 
 who replied the cornet in a serious tone  
the prince told me to  and tell the colonel 
that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge 
 was followed by an officer of the who up 
to the colonel of hussars with the same order after 
him the stout came up on a cossack horse that 
could scarcely carry his weight   this colonel he 
shouted as he approached  told you to fire the 
bridge and now someone has gone and they are all 
beside themselves over there and one can make anything out 
 the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to 
  spoke to me of material said he  
you said nothing about it   my dear sir 
said as he drew up taking off his cap and 
smoothing his hair with with his plump hand  i 
telling you to fire the bridge when material had been 
put in position   am not your  sir 
staff officer and you did not tell me to burn 
the bridge i know the service and it is my 
habit orders to obey you said the bridge would be 
but who would it burn i could not know by 
the spirit   that always the way said with 
a of the hand  did you get here said 
he turning to   the same business but you 
are let me you out   were saying staff 
officer continued the colonel in an offended tone   
interrupted the officer of the  must be quick or 
the will bring up his to use  the colonel 
looked silently at the officer of the at the stout 
staff officer and at and he frowned   will 
the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as 
if to announce that in spite of all the he 
had to endure he would still do the right thing 
 striking his horse with his long muscular legs as 
if it were to for everything the colonel moved forward 
and ordered the second that in which rostov was serving 
under to return to the bridge   it just 
as i thought said rostov to himself  wishes to 
test me his heart and the blood rushed to his 
face  him see whether i am a he thought 
 again on all the bright faces of the the 
serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire 
rostov watched his the colonel find in his face of 
his own but the colonel did not once glance at 
rostov and looked as he always did when at the 
front solemn and stern then came the word of command 
  sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him 
 their in the and their spurs the hussars hastily 
not knowing what they were to do the men were 
crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he 
had no time he was afraid of falling behind the 
hussars so much afraid that his heart stood still his 
hand trembled as he gave his horse into an and 
he felt the blood rush to his heart with a 
past him back and shouting something rostov saw nothing but 
the hussars running all around him their spurs and their 
  shouted someone behind him  rostov did not 
think what this call for meant he ran on trying 
only to be of the others but just at the 
bridge not looking at the ground he came on some 
trodden and fell on his hands the others him  
 captain he heard the voice of the colonel who 
having had pulled up his horse near the bridge with 
a cheerful face  rostov wiping his hands on his 
breeches looked at his and was about to run on 
thinking that the farther he went to the front the 
better but without looking at or rostov shouted to him 
  that running on the middle of the bridge 
to the right come back cadet he cried angrily and 
turning to who showing off his courage had on to 
the of the bridge   run captain you should 
he said   every has its answered turning in 
his   meanwhile and the officer of the were 
standing together out of of the watching now the small 
group of men with dark with and blue breeches who 
were near the bridge and then at what was approaching 
in the distance from the opposite side blue and groups 
with horses easily as   they burn the bridge 
or not who get there first will they get there 
and fire the bridge or will the french get within 
and them out these were the questions each man of 
the on the high ground above the bridge asked himself 
with a heart the bridge and the hussars in the 
bright evening light and the blue from the other side 
with their and   the hussars will get it 
hot said  are within now   have taken 
so many men said the officer of the   
enough answered  fellows could have done the job just 
as well   your excellency put in his eyes 
fixed on the hussars but still with that naive air 
that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking 
in or in  your excellency how you look at 
things send two men and who then would give us 
the and ribbon but now even if they do get 
the may be recommended for and he may get a 
ribbon our knows how things are done   now 
said the officer of the   he pointed to 
the french the of which were being and hurriedly removed 
 on the french side amid the groups with a 
cloud of smoke appeared then a second and a third 
almost and at the moment when the first report was 
heard a fourth was seen then two reports one after 
another and a third   oh as if in 
the officer of the by the arm  a man 
has   i think   i were i 
would never go to war said turning away  the 
french were hastily the infantry in their blue toward the 
bridge at a run smoke appeared again but at and 
cracked and rattled onto the bridge but this time could 
not see what was there as a cloud of smoke 
from it the hussars had succeeded in setting it on 
fire and the french were now at them no longer 
to them but because the were and there was someone 
to fire at  the french had time to fire 
three of before the hussars got back to their horses 
two were and the went too high but the last 
round fell in the midst of a group of hussars 
and three of them over  rostov by his relations 
with had paused on the bridge not knowing what to 
do there was no one to down  he had 
always imagined to himself nor could he help to fire 
the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw 
with him like the other soldiers he stood looking about 
him when suddenly he heard a on the bridge as 
if were being and the hussar to him fell against 
the with a rostov ran up to him with the 
others again someone shouted  four men seized the hussar 
and began lifting him   for sake let me 
alone cried the man but still he was lifted and 
laid on the  nicholas rostov turned away and as 
if searching for something gazed into the distance at the 
of the at the sky and at the sun how 
beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how 
deep how bright and was the setting sun with what 
soft the of the shone and still were the blue 
the river the the and the veiled in the of 
their there was peace and happiness  should wish for 
nothing else nothing if only i were there thought rostov 
 myself alone and in that there is so much 
happiness but here suffering fear and this and there are 
shouting again and again are all running back somewhere and 
i shall run with them and it death is here 
above me and around another instant and i shall never 
again see the sun this water that  at that 
instant the sun began to hide behind the and other 
came into before rostov and the fear of death and 
of the and love of the sun and of life 
all into one feeling of agitation   god who 
art in that heaven save forgive and me rostov whispered 
 the hussars ran back to the men who held 
their horses their voices sounded louder and calmer the from 
sight   so you smelt shouted just above his 
  all over but i am a a thought 
rostov and sighing deeply he took his horse which stood 
resting one foot from the and began to   
that he asked   and no mistake cried  
worked like and it work an attack pleasant work away 
at the dogs but this sort of thing is the 
very devil with them at you like a  and 
up to a group that had stopped near rostov of 
the colonel and the officer from the   it 
seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this 
was true no one had taken any notice for everyone 
knew the which the cadet under fire for the first 
time had experienced   something for you to report 
said  if i don get to a   
the prince that i the bridge said the colonel and 
gaily   if he asks about the   
said the colonel in his bass voice  hussars and 
one out he added unable to restrain a happy smile 
and pronouncing the phrase  out with ringing   
   chapter ix   by the french 
army of a hundred thousand men under the command of 
bonaparte a that was to it losing confidence in its 
suffering from shortness of and compelled to act under of 
war unlike anything that had been the russian army of 
thirty thousand men by kutuzov was hurriedly along the stopping 
where by the and actions only as far as necessary 
to it to without losing its heavy equipment there had 
been actions at and but despite the courage and even 
by the which the russians fought the only of these 
actions was a yet more that had at and had 
joined kutuzov at now from the russian army and kutuzov 
was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces 
the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought 
of instead of an offensive the plan of which carefully 
prepared in accord with the modern science of had been 
to kutuzov when he was in vienna by the the 
sole and almost aim remaining for him was to effect 
a with the forces that were from russia without losing 
his army as had done at  on the twenty 
of kutuzov with his army to the left bank of 
the and took up a position for the first time 
with the river between himself and the main body of 
the french on the he attacked which was on the 
left bank and broke it up in this for the 
first time were taken and two for the first time 
after a the russian had and after a fight had 
not only held the field but had the french though 
the were ill exhausted and had lost a third of 
their number in killed and though a number of and 
had been on the other side of the with a 
letter in which kutuzov them to the of the and 
though the big and the in into military could no 
longer all the and yet the stand made at and 
the over raised the of the army the whole army 
and at most joyful though were of the imaginary of 
from russia of some gained by the and of the 
of the frightened bonaparte  prince andrew during the battle 
had been in on the general who was killed in 
the his horse had been under him and his own 
arm slightly by a as a mark of the commander 
in chief special favor he was sent with the news 
of this to the court now no longer at vienna 
 was by the french but at despite his apparently 
delicate build prince andrew could endure far better than many 
very muscular men and on the night of the battle 
having arrived at but not weary with from to kutuzov 
he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to to 
be so sent meant not only a reward but an 
important step toward  the night was dark but the 
road showed black in the snow that had the previous 
day day of the battle his of the battle to 
himself the his news of a would create or the 
send given him by the commander in chief and his 
fellow officers prince andrew was along in a post the 
of a man who has at length to a long 
happiness as soon as he closed his eyes his ears 
seemed filled with the of the wheels and the of 
then he began to imagine that the russians were running 
away and that he himself was killed but he quickly 
roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning 
that this was not so but that on the contrary 
the french had run away he again recalled all the 
of the and his own calm courage during the battle 
and feeling he off the dark night was followed by 
a bright cheerful morning the snow was in the the 
horses quickly and on both sides of the road were 
of different kinds and  at one of the post 
he overtook a of russian the russian officer in of 
the lolled back in the front shouting and a with 
coarse in each of the long german six or more 
pale dirty men were being over the road some of 
them were talking  heard russian words others were the 
more severely looked silently with the interest of children at 
the hurrying past them  prince andrew told his to 
stop and asked a in what they had been  
before yesterday on the answered the prince andrew took out 
his purse and gave the three gold   for 
them all he said to the officer who came up 
  well soon he continued turning to the soldiers 
 to do still   news sir asked the 
officer evidently anxious to start a conversation   news 
go on he shouted to the and they on  
it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over 
the of and found himself by high the lights of 
and street fine carriages and all that of a large 
and active town which is always so attractive to a 
after life despite his and night prince andrew when he 
drove up to the felt even more vigorous and than 
he had done the day before only his eyes and 
his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary and he again 
recalled the of the battle no longer but definite and 
in the form in which he imagined himself them to 
the emperor he imagined the questions that might be put 
to him and the he would give he expected to 
be at once to the emperor at the chief entrance 
to the however an official came running out to meet 
him and learning that he was a special led him 
to another entrance   the right from the there 
you will find the adjutant on duty said the official 
 will conduct you to the of war  the 
adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait 
and went in to the of war five minutes later 
he returned and with particular prince andrew before him along 
a to the where the of war was at work 
the adjutant by his appeared to wish to off any 
at familiarity on the part of the russian  prince 
andrew joyous feeling was as he approached the door of 
the room he felt offended and without his noticing it 
the feeling of immediately turned into one of which was 
quite for his mind instantly suggested to him a point 
of which gave him a right to the adjutant and 
the  from the smell of they probably think it 
easy to gain he thought his eyes disdainfully he entered 
the room of the of war with peculiarly steps this 
feeling of was when he saw the seated at a 
large table reading some papers and making notes on them 
and for the first two or three minutes taking no 
notice of his arrival a stood at each side of 
the bent bald head with its gray he went on 
reading to the end without raising his eyes at the 
opening of the door and the sound of footsteps  
 this and it said he to his adjutant him 
the papers and still taking no notice of the special 
 prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzov 
army interested the of war less than any of the 
other matters he was concerned with or he wanted to 
give the russian special that  that is a matter 
of indifference to me he thought the drew the remaining 
papers together arranged them and then raised his head he 
had an intellectual and head but the instant he turned 
to prince andrew the firm intelligent expression on his face 
changed in a way evidently and habitual to him his 
face took on the stupid artificial smile  does not 
even to hide its of a man who is continually 
receiving many one after another   general field kutuzov 
he asked  hope it is good news there has 
been an with a it was high time  he 
took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began 
to read it with a mournful expression   my 
god my god he exclaimed in german  a what 
a  having glanced through the dispatch he laid it 
on the table and looked at prince andrew evidently considering 
something   what a you say the affair was 
but is not captured again he pondered  am very 
glad you have brought good news though death is a 
heavy to pay for the his majesty will no doubt 
wish to see you but not today i thank you 
you must have a rest be at the tomorrow after 
the however i will let you know  the stupid 
smile which had left his face while he was speaking 
  revoir thank you very much his majesty will 
probably desire to see you he added his head  
when prince andrew left the he felt that all the 
interest and happiness the had him had been now left 
in the indifferent hands of the of war and the 
polite adjutant the whole of his thoughts instantaneously changed the 
battle seemed the memory of a long past   
   chapter x   prince andrew stayed 
at with a russian acquaintance of his in the service 
  my dear prince i could not have a 
more visitor said as he came out to meet prince 
andrew  put the prince things in my said he 
to the who was bolkonski in  you a of 
eh splendid and i am sitting here ill as you 
see  after and prince andrew came into the diplomat 
luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for 
him settled down beside the fire  after his and 
the during which he had been of all the of 
and all the of life prince andrew felt a pleasant 
sense of among luxurious such as he had been accustomed 
to from childhood besides it was pleasant after his reception 
by the to speak if not in russian  they 
were speaking french at least with a russian who would 
he the general russian to the which was then particularly 
strong  was a man of thirty a bachelor and 
of the same circle as prince andrew they had known 
each other in petersburg but had become more intimate when 
prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov just as prince 
andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising 
high in the military profession so to an even greater 
gave promise of rising in his career he still a 
young man but no longer a young diplomat as he 
had entered the service at the age of sixteen had 
been in paris and and now held a rather important 
post in vienna both the foreign and our ambassador in 
vienna knew him and him he was not one of 
those many who are because they have certain qualities avoid 
doing certain things and speak french he was one of 
those who work knew how to do it and despite 
his would sometimes spend a whole night at his table 
he worked well the of his work it was not 
the question  for but the question  that interested 
him what the matter might be he did not care 
but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a or 
report and were not only for what he wrote but 
also for his in and conversing with those in the 
highest  liked conversation as he liked work only when 
it could be made witty in society he always an 
opportunity to say something striking and took part in a 
conversation only when that was possible his conversation was always 
with finished phrases of general interest these were prepared in 
the inner of his mind in a form as if 
intentionally so that insignificant society people might carry them from 
drawing room to drawing room and in fact were about 
in the drawing rooms and often had an influence on 
matters considered important  his thin worn sallow face was 
covered with deep wrinkles which always looked as clean and 
well washed as the tips of one fingers after a 
russian the movement of these wrinkles formed the play of 
expression on his face now his forehead would into deep 
folds and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would 
and deep wrinkles would his his small deep eyes always 
and looked out straight   now tell me about 
your said he  bolkonski very modestly without once himself 
described the and his reception by the of war  
 received me and my news as one a dog 
in a game of said he in  smiled and 
the wrinkles on his face   mon cher he 
remarked his from a distance and puckering the skin above 
his left eye  la je the russian army des 
plus          
 my dear fellow with all my respect for the 
     russian army i must say 
that your was not      particularly 
victorious   he went on talking in this way 
in french uttering only those words in russian on which 
he wished to put a emphasis   now you 
with all your forces fall on the unfortunate and his 
one and even then through your fingers where the  
 seriously said prince andrew  can at any rate 
say without that it was a little better than at 
  didn you one just one for us  
 not everything happens as one expects or with the 
of a we had expected as i told you to 
get at their by seven in the morning but had 
not reached it by five in the   why 
didn you do it at seven in the morning you 
ought to have been there at seven in the morning 
returned with a smile  ought to have been there 
at seven in the morning   did you not 
succeed in on bonaparte by that he had better leave 
genoa alone prince andrew in the same tone   
know interrupted  thinking it very easy to take sitting 
on a sofa by the fire that is true but 
still why didn you him so don be surprised if 
not only the of war but also his most august 
majesty the emperor and king is not much delighted by 
your even i a poor secretary of the russian do 
not feel any need in token of my joy to 
give my a or let him go with his to 
the true we have no here  he looked straight 
at prince andrew and suddenly his forehead   is 
now my turn to ask you  mon cher said 
bolkonski  confess i do not understand perhaps there are 
here my intelligence but i can make it out loses 
a whole army the and the give no signs of 
life and make after kutuzov alone at last a real 
the spell of the of the french and the of 
war does not even care to hear the   
just it my dear fellow you see it for the 
for russia for the faith all that is beautiful but 
what do we i mean the court care for your 
bring us nice news of a by the or  
as good as another as you know and even if 
it is only over a fire of bonaparte that will 
be another story and we fire off some but this 
sort of thing seems done on purpose to us the 
does nothing the himself you vienna give up its defense 
much as to say  is with us but heaven 
help you and your capital the one general whom we 
all loved you to a and then you congratulate us 
on the admit that more irritating news than yours could 
not have been it as if it had been done 
on purpose on purpose besides suppose you did gain a 
brilliant if even the gained a what effect would that 
have on the general course of it too late now 
when vienna is occupied by the french army   
occupied vienna occupied   only occupied but bonaparte is 
at and the count our dear count goes to him 
for orders  after the and of the his reception 
and especially after having bolkonski felt that he could not 
take in the full of the words he heard  
 was here this morning continued  showed me a 
letter in which the of the french in vienna was 
fully described prince le you see that your is not 
a matter for great and that you can be received 
as a   i don care about that i 
don care at all said prince andrew beginning to understand 
that his news of the battle before was really of 
small importance in of such as the fall of austria 
capital  is it vienna was taken what of the 
bridge and its celebrated and prince we heard reports that 
prince was vienna he said   is on this 
on our side of the river and is us it 
very badly i think but still he is us but 
vienna is on the other side no the bridge has 
not yet been taken and i hope it will not 
be for it is and orders have been given to 
blow it up we should long ago have been in 
the of and you and your army would have spent 
a bad of an hour between two   still 
this does not mean that the is over said prince 
andrew   i think it is the here think 
so too but they say so it will be as 
i said at the beginning of the it won be 
your at or at all that will decide the matter 
but those who it said quoting one of his own 
the wrinkles on his forehead and  only question is 
what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander 
and the king of prussia in if prussia the austria 
hand will be forced and there will be war if 
not it is merely a question of settling where the 
of the new are to be drawn up   
an extraordinary prince andrew suddenly exclaimed his small hand and 
striking the table with it  what luck the man 
has   said inquiringly puckering up his forehead to 
indicate that he was about to say something witty  
he repeated the  think however now that he down 
for austria at il faut faire grace de l  
i shall certainly an and call him simply bonaparte  
       must let him 
off the    apart said prince andrew  
you really think the is over   is what 
i think austria has been made a fool of and 
she is not used to it she will and she 
has been in the first place because her have been 
say the russian army army is destroyed her capital taken 
and all this for the  of his majesty and 
therefore is between ourselves feel that we are being my 
tells me of with france and for peace a secret 
peace concluded separately        
fine eyes    cried prince andrew  would 
be too base   we live we shall see 
replied his face again becoming as a sign that the 
conversation was at an end  when prince andrew reached 
the room prepared for him and lay down in a 
clean shirt on the feather bed with its and he 
felt that the battle of which he had brought was 
far far away from him the alliance with prussia austria 
bonaparte new tomorrow and and the audience with the emperor 
occupied his thoughts  he closed his eyes and immediately 
a sound of of and the of carriage wheels seemed 
to his ears and now again drawn out in a 
thin line the were the hill the french were and 
he felt his heart as he forward beside with the 
merrily all around and he experienced the joy of living 
as he had not done since childhood  he up 
  that all happened he said and smiling to 
himself like a child he fell into a deep youthful 
     chapter xi   next 
day he late his the first thought that came into 
his mind was that today he had to be to 
the emperor he remembered the of war the polite adjutant 
and last night conversation having dressed for his at court 
in full uniform which he had not worn for a 
long time he went into study fresh animated and handsome 
with his hand in the study were four gentlemen of 
the corps with prince hippolyte kuragin who was a secretary 
to the bolkonski was already acquainted introduced him to the 
others  the gentlemen assembled at were young wealthy gay 
society men who here as in vienna formed a special 
set which their called  this set almost of evidently 
had its own interests which had nothing to do with 
war or politics but related to high society to certain 
women and to the official side of the service these 
gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves an honor 
they did not to many from politeness and to start 
conversation they asked him a few questions about the army 
and the battle and then the talk went off into 
merry and gossip        
ours    the best of it was said 
one telling of the of a fellow diplomat  the 
told him that his appointment to london was a and 
that he was so to regard it can you fancy 
the figure he cut   the of it gentlemen 
am giving kuragin away to you that that man and 
this don wicked fellow is taking of it  prince 
hippolyte was in a chair with his legs over its 
arm he began to laugh   me about that 
he said   you don you cried several voices 
  bolkonski don know said turning to prince andrew 
 all the of the french army  nearly said 
of the russian army are nothing to what this man 
has been doing among the women   femme est 
la de l  announced prince hippolyte and began looking 
through a lorgnette at his legs     
    is man companion   and 
the rest of  burst out laughing in hippolyte face 
and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whom had to 
admit had almost been on his wife account was the 
of this set   i must give you a 
treat whispered to bolkonski  is when he politics should 
see his gravity  he sat down beside hippolyte and 
his forehead began talking to him about politics prince andrew 
and the others gathered round these two   cannot 
express a feeling of alliance began hippolyte gazing round with 
importance at the others  expressing as in its last 
note you understand besides unless his majesty the emperor from 
the of our alliance   i have not finished 
he said to prince andrew him by the arm  
believe that will be than and he paused  one 
cannot the of our dispatch of  that is how 
it will end and he bolkonski arm to indicate that 
he had now quite finished   i know thee 
by the in mouth said and the of hair on 
his head moved with satisfaction  everybody laughed and hippolyte 
louder than anyone he was evidently distressed and but could 
not restrain the wild laughter that his usually features  
 now gentlemen said  is my in this house

     chapter xii   at 
the prince andrew stood among the officers as he had 
been told to and the emperor merely looked fixedly into 
his face and just nodded to him with his long 
head but after it was over the adjutant he had 
seen the previous day bolkonski that the emperor desired to 
give him an audience the emperor received him standing in 
the middle of the room before the conversation began prince 
andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed 
confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say 
  me when did the battle begin he asked 
hurriedly  prince andrew replied then followed other questions just 
as simple  kutuzov well when had he left and 
so on the emperor spoke as if his sole aim 
were to put a given number of questions to these 
questions as was only too evident did not interest him 
  what o did the battle begin asked the 
emperor   cannot inform your majesty at what o 
the battle began at the front but at where i 
was our attack began after five in the replied bolkonski 
growing more animated and expecting that he would have a 
to give a account which he had ready in his 
mind of all he knew and had seen but the 
emperor smiled and interrupted him   many   
where to where your majesty   to   
and a half your majesty   french have the 
left bank   to the the last of them 
on during the night   there sufficient in  
 has not been to the  the emperor interrupted 
him   what o was general killed   
seven o i believe   seven o it very 
sad very sad  the emperor thanked prince andrew and 
bowed prince andrew and was immediately by on all sides 
everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words yesterday 
adjutant him for not having stayed at the and offered 
him his own house the of war came up and 
him on the order of the third which the emperor 
was on him the empress him to see her majesty 
the also wished to see him he did not know 
whom to answer and for a few his thoughts then 
the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder led him 
to the window and began to talk to him  
contrary to the news he had brought was joyfully received 
a service was arranged kutuzov was the grand cross of 
and the whole army received bolkonski was everywhere and had 
to spend the whole morning calling on the between four 
and five in the having made all his calls he 
was returning to house thinking out a letter to his 
father about the battle and his visit to at the 
door he found a half full of man was a 
with some difficulty out of the front door  before 
returning to prince andrew had gone to a to provide 
himself with some for the and had spent some time 
in the   is it he asked   
your excellency said with difficulty rolling the into the  
are to move on still farther the is again at 
our heels   what asked prince andrew  came 
out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement 
  now confess that this is delightful said he 
 affair of the bridge at vienna they have without 
striking a blow  prince andrew could not understand  
 where do you come from not to know what 
every in the town knows   come from the 
i heard nothing there   you didn see that 
everybody is up   did not what is it 
all about inquired prince andrew   it all about 
why the french have the bridge that was and the 
bridge was not up so is now rushing along the 
road to and will be here in a day or 
two   here but why did they not blow 
up the bridge if it was   is what 
i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why 
 bolkonski shrugged his shoulders   if the bridge 
is it means that the army too is lost it 
will be cut off said he   just it 
answered  the french entered vienna as i told you 
very well next day which was yesterday those gentlemen  
and and ride to the bridge  that all three 
are  says one of them  know the bridge 
is and and that there are menacing at its head 
and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered 
to blow up the bridge and not let us cross 
but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if 
we take this bridge so let us three go and 
take it  let say the others and off they 
go and take the bridge cross it and now with 
their whole army are on this side of the on 
us you and your lines of     
   the    said prince andrew 
sadly and seriously this news him and yet he was 
pleased  as soon as he learned that the russian 
army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to 
him that it was he who was to lead it 
out of this position that here was the that would 
lift him from the ranks of officers and him the 
first step to listening to he was already how on 
reaching the army he would give an opinion at the 
war which would be the only one that could save 
the army and how he alone would be with the 
executing of the plan   this he said  
 am not went on  is or these gentlemen 
ride onto the bridge alone and white they assure the 
officer on duty that they the are on their way 
to with prince he them enter the tete  they 
him a thousand saying that the war is over that 
the emperor is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that they 
desire to see prince and so on the officer for 
these gentlemen embrace the officers sit on the and meanwhile 
a french gets to the bridge the of material into 
the water and the tete at length the lieutenant general 
our dear prince himself  foe flower of the army 
hero of the turkish wars are ended we can one 
another hand the emperor napoleon with impatience to make prince 
acquaintance in a word those gentlemen indeed so him with 
fine words and he is so flattered by his rapidly 
with the french and so by the sight of mantle 
and faire faire sur l  in spite of the 
animation of his speech did not forget to pause after 
this to give time for its appreciation  french to 
the the and the bridge is taken but what is 
best of all he went on his excitement under the 
delightful interest of his own story  that the in 
of the which was to give the signal to fire 
the and blow up the bridge this seeing that the 
french were running onto the bridge was about to fire 
but stayed his hand the who was evidently than his 
general goes up to and says  you are being 
here are the french seeing that all is lost if 
the is allowed to speak to with feigned  is 
a true and says  don recognize the world if 
you allow a to you like that it was a 
of prince his dignity at stake and orders the to 
be come you must own that this affair of the 
bridge is delightful it is not exactly nor   
          
    that their fire gets into his 
eyes and he that      he 
ought to be at the    may be 
said prince andrew the gray the smoke of the sounds 
of and the glory that him   that either 
that the court in too bad a light replied  
not nor nor it is just as at it is 
seemed to be trying to find the right expression  
nous  is it is a bit of we are 
he concluded feeling that he had produced a good epigram 
a fresh one that would be repeated his puckered became 
as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile 
he began to his   are you off to 
he said suddenly to prince andrew who had and was 
going toward his room   am going away  
 to   the army   you meant 
to stay another two days   now i am 
off at once  and prince andrew after giving directions 
about his went to his room   you know 
mon cher said following him  have been thinking about 
you why are you going  and in of the 
of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face 
 prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no 
reply   are you going i know you think 
it your duty to back to the army now that 
it is in danger i understand that mon cher it 
is   at all said prince andrew   
as you are a be a one look at the 
other side of the question and you will see that 
your duty on the contrary is to take care of 
yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit 
for anything else you have not been ordered to return 
and have not been dismissed from here therefore you can 
stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes 
us they say we are going to and is a 
very town you and i will travel in my  
 stop cried bolkonski   am speaking sincerely as 
a friend consider where and why are you going when 
you might remain here you are by one of two 
things and the skin over his left puckered  you 
will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded or 
you will and with kutuzov whole army  and his 
feeling that the was   cannot about it replied 
prince andrew coldly but he thought  am going to 
save the army   dear fellow you are a 
hero said      chapter xiii  
 that same night having taken leave of the of 
war bolkonski set off to the army not knowing where 
he would find it and fearing to be captured by 
the french on the way to  in everybody attached 
to the court was up and the heavy was already 
being to near prince andrew struck the high road along 
which the russian army was moving with great and in 
the greatest the road was so with that it was 
impossible to get by in a carriage prince andrew took 
a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander and 
and weary making his way past the in search of 
the commander in chief and of his own very reports 
of the position of the army reached him as he 
went along and the appearance of the in their flight 
these   l de l a des de l 
nous faire le sort sort de l d  he 
remembered these words in bonaparte to his army at the 
beginning of the and they in him at the of 
his hero a feeling of pride and a hope of 
glory  should there be nothing left but to die 
he thought  if need be i shall do it 
no worse than others       
   russian army which has been brought from 
the of      the earth by 
english gold we shall cause to the same   
   fate fate of the army at  
 he looked with at the confused of and again 
and of all kinds one another and blocking the road 
three and sometimes four from all sides behind and before 
as far as could reach there were the of wheels 
the of and carriages the of horses the of shouts 
the of horses and the of soldiers and officers all 
along the sides of the road horses were to be 
seen some some not and broken beside which soldiers sat 
waiting for something and again soldiers from their of whom 
set off to the or returned from them and at 
each or of the road the were yet and the 
of shouting more soldiers knee in pushed the and themselves 
cracked slipped broke and were strained with shouting the officers 
the march backward and forward between the their voices were 
but feebly heard amid the and one saw by their 
faces that they of the of this   is 
our dear russian army thought bolkonski words  wishing to 
find out where the commander in chief was he up 
to a opposite to him came a strange one evidently 
up by soldiers out of any and looking like something 
between a a and a a was and a woman 
in sat behind the under the of the prince andrew 
up and was just putting his question to a when 
his attention was by the desperate of the woman in 
the an officer in of was the who was the 
woman for trying to get of others and the of 
his fell on the of the the woman screamed seeing 
prince andrew she leaned out from behind the and her 
thin arms from under the shawl cried   aide 
aide for heaven sake me what will become of us 
i am the wife of the doctor of the they 
won let us pass we are left behind and have 
lost our people   you into a shouted the 
angry officer to the  back with your   
aide help me what does it all mean screamed the 
doctor wife   let this pass don you see 
it a woman said prince andrew up to the officer 
 the officer glanced at him and without turned again 
to the  you to on back   them 
pass i tell you repeated prince andrew his lips  
 who are you cried the officer turning on him 
with tipsy  are you are you in command here 
eh i am commander here not you go back or 
i you into a repeated he this expression evidently pleased 
him   was a nice for the little aide 
came a voice from behind  prince andrew saw that 
the officer was in that state of tipsy when a 
man does not know what he is saying he saw 
that his of the doctor wife in her queer trap 
might him to what he more than anything in the 
world but his him on before the officer finished his 
sentence prince andrew his face distorted with up to him 
and raised his   let  the officer his 
arm and hastily away   all the of these 
fellows on the staff that there this he muttered  
as you like  prince andrew without lifting his eyes 
hastily away from the doctor wife who was calling him 
her and with a sense of the of this humiliating 
scene he on to the village where he was told 
that the commander in chief was  on reaching the 
village he and went to the house intending to rest 
if but for a moment eat something and try to 
sort out the stinging and thoughts that confused his mind 
 is a of and not an army he was 
thinking as he went up to the window of the 
first house when a familiar voice called him by name 
 he turned round handsome face looked out of the 
little window moving his lips as he something and his 
arm called him to enter   bolkonski don you 
hear eh come quick he shouted  entering the house 
prince andrew saw and another adjutant having something to eat 
they hastily turned round to him asking if he had 
any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and 
alarm this was particularly on usually laughing countenance   
is the commander in chief asked bolkonski   in 
that house answered the adjutant   is it true 
that it peace and asked   was going to 
ask you i know nothing except that it was all 
i could do to get here   we my 
dear boy it terrible i was wrong to laugh at 
we getting it still worse said  sit down and 
have something to eat   won be able to 
find either your or anything else now prince and god 
only knows where your man peter is said the other 
adjutant   are   are to spend the 
night in   i have got all i need 
into for two horses said  made up splendid for 
me to cross the with it a bad old fellow 
but what the matter with you you must be ill 
to shiver like that he added noticing that prince andrew 
as at an electric   nothing replied prince andrew 
 he had just remembered his with the doctor wife 
and the officer   is the commander in chief 
doing here he asked   can make out at 
all said   all i can make out is 
that everything is quite said prince andrew and he went 
off to the house where the commander in chief was 
 passing by kutuzov carriage and the exhausted horses of 
his with their who were talking loudly together prince andrew 
entered the passage kutuzov himself he was told was in 
the house with prince and was the general who had 
succeeded in the passage little was on his heels in 
front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turned up 
was hastily at a tub turned bottom face looked worn 
too had evidently not all night he glanced at prince 
andrew and did not even nod to him   
line have you written it he continued to the clerk 
   can write so fast your honor said 
the clerk glancing angrily and at  through the door 
came the sounds of kutuzov voice and dissatisfied interrupted by 
another an voice from the sound of these voices the 
way looked at him the manner of the exhausted clerk 
the fact that the clerk and were on the floor 
by a tub so near to the commander in chief 
and from the laughter of the holding the horses near 
the window prince andrew felt that something important and was 
about to happen  he turned to with questions  
 prince said  for   about   
of the sort orders are for a battle  prince 
andrew moved toward the door from voices were heard just 
as he was going to open it the sounds ceased 
the door opened and kutuzov with his nose and face 
appeared in the doorway prince andrew stood right in front 
of kutuzov but the expression of the commander in chief 
one sound eye showed him to be so with thoughts 
and as to be oblivious of his presence he looked 
straight at his adjutant face without him   have 
you finished said he to   moment your excellency 
 a middle man of medium height with a firm 
face of oriental type came out after the commander in 
chief   have the honor to present myself repeated 
prince andrew rather loudly kutuzov an   from vienna 
very good later later  kutuzov went out into the 
porch with   good prince said he to  
and may be with you in your great  his 
face suddenly and tears came into his eyes with his 
left hand he drew toward him and with his right 
on which he wore a ring he made the sign 
of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual 
his but kissed him on the neck instead   
be with you kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage 
 in with me said he to bolkonski   
excellency i should like to be of use here allow 
me to remain with prince   in said kutuzov 
and noticing that bolkonski still he added  need good 
officers myself need them myself  they got into the 
carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence  
 is still much much before us he said as 
if with an old man he understood all that was 
passing in bolkonski mind  a tenth part of his 
returns i shall thank god he added as if speaking 
to himself  prince andrew glanced at kutuzov face only 
a foot from him and noticed the carefully washed of 
the near his where an had his skull and the 
empty eye  he has a right to speak so 
of those men death thought bolkonski   is why 
i beg to be sent to that he said  
kutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what 
he had been saying and sat in thought five minutes 
later gently swaying on the soft of the carriage he 
turned to prince andrew there was not a trace of 
agitation on his face with delicate irony he prince andrew 
about the of his interview with the emperor about the 
remarks he had heard at court the affair and about 
some ladies they both knew      
chapter xiv   on  kutuzov had received through 
a news that the army he was in an almost 
hopeless position the that the french after crossing the bridge 
at vienna were in immense force upon kutuzov line of 
with the that were from russia if kutuzov decided to 
remain at napoleon army of one hundred and fifty thousand 
men would cut him off completely and his exhausted army 
of forty thousand and he would find himself in the 
position of at if kutuzov decided to the road him 
with the from russia he would have to march with 
no road into of the himself against superior forces of 
the and all hope of a with if kutuzov decided 
to along the road from to to with the from 
russia he being on that road by the french who 
had the vienna bridge and by his and having to 
accept battle on the march against an three times as 
strong who would him in from two sides  kutuzov 
chose this latter course  the french the having the 
vienna bridge were by forced toward which lay off on 
the line of kutuzov if he reached before the french 
there would be great hope of the army to let 
the french him at meant the of his whole army 
to a such as that of or to utter but 
to the french with his whole army was impossible the 
road for the french from vienna to was and better 
than the road for the russians from to  the 
night he received the news kutuzov sent four thousand strong 
to the right across the hills from the to the 
vienna road was to make this march without resting and 
to halt facing vienna with to his and if he 
succeeded in the french he was to delay them as 
long as possible kutuzov himself with all his took the 
road to  thirty that night across hills with his 
ill soldiers and losing a third of his men as 
by the way came out on the vienna road at 
a few hours of the french who were approaching from 
vienna kutuzov with his had still to march for some 
days before he could reach with his four thousand exhausted 
men would have to for days the whole army that 
came upon him at which was clearly impossible but a 
of fate made the impossible possible the success of the 
trick that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands 
of the french without a fight led to try to 
kutuzov in a way meeting weak on the road he 
it to be kutuzov whole army to be able to 
crush it absolutely he the arrival of the rest of 
the who were on their way from vienna and with 
this object offered a three days truce on condition that 
both should remain in position without moving declared that for 
peace were already and that he therefore offered this truce 
to avoid unnecessary count the general occupying the believed and 
leaving exposed another to the russian line to announce the 
peace and to the russian army the three days truce 
replied that he was not either to accept or refuse 
a truce and sent his adjutant to kutuzov to report 
the he had received  a truce was kutuzov sole 
of gaining time giving exhausted some rest and letting the 
and heavy  movements were from the french if but 
one nearer the of a truce gave the only and 
a quite of the army on receiving the news he 
immediately adjutant general wintzingerode who was in on him to 
the wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce 
but also to terms of and meanwhile kutuzov sent his 
adjutants back to to the the movements of the of 
the army along the road exhausted and which alone covered 
this movement of the and of the whole army had 
to remain in face of an eight times as strong 
as itself  kutuzov expectations that the of  were 
in no way might give time for part of the 
to pass and also that mistake would very soon be 
discovered correct as soon as bonaparte  was at sixteen 
from received dispatch with the of a truce and a 
he a and wrote the following letter to   
 brumaire   at eight o in the morning 
 to prince  i cannot find words to express 
to you my you command only my and have no 
right to arrange an without my order you are causing 
me to lose the of a break the immediately and 
march on the inform him that the general who that 
had no right to do so and that no one 
but the emperor of russia has that right  if 
however the emperor of russia that i will it but 
it is only a trick march on the russian army 
you are in a position to seize its and  
the russian emperor aide is an officers are nothing when 
they have no this one had none the let themselves 
be at the crossing of the vienna bridge you are 
letting yourself be by an aide of the emperor  
napoleon   bonaparte adjutant full with this menacing letter 
to bonaparte himself not to his moved with all the 
guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a 
ready escape and four thousand men merrily lighted and themselves 
their for the first time for three days and not 
one of them knew or imagined what was in store 
for him      chapter xv  
 between three and four o in the prince andrew 
who had in his request to kutuzov arrived at and 
himself to bonaparte adjutant had not yet reached and the 
battle had not yet in no one knew anything of 
the general position of affairs they talked of peace but 
did not believe in its others talked of a battle 
but also in the of an knowing bolkonski to be 
a favorite and adjutant received him with and special of 
favor explaining to him that there would probably be an 
that day or the next and giving him full liberty 
to remain with him during the battle or to join 
the and have an eye on the order of  
is also very important   there will hardly be 
an today said as if to reassure prince andrew  
 he is one of the ordinary little staff sent 
to a he can get his reward just as well 
in the but if he wishes to stay with me 
let him he be of use here if he a 
officer thought prince andrew without asked the prince to ride 
round the position to see the disposition of the forces 
so as to know his should he be sent to 
an order the officer on duty a handsome dressed man 
with a diamond ring on his who was fond of 
speaking french though he spoke it badly offered to conduct 
prince andrew  on all sides they saw rain officers 
with faces who seemed to be something and soldiers doors 
and from the village   now prince we can 
stop those fellows said the staff officer pointing to the 
soldiers  officers don keep them in hand and there 
he pointed to a  crowd in and sit this 
morning i turned them all out and now look it 
full again i must go there prince and them a 
bit it won take a moment   let go 
in and i will get myself a and some said 
prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat 
anything   didn you mention it prince i would 
have offered you something  they and entered the several 
officers with flushed and weary faces were sitting at the 
table and drinking   what does this mean gentlemen 
said the staff officer in the tone of a man 
who has repeated the same thing more than once  
know it won do to leave your like this the 
prince gave orders that no one should leave his post 
now you captain and he turned to a thin dirty 
little officer who without his  had given them to 
the to dry in only his stockings rose when they 
entered smiling not   you ashamed of yourself captain 
he continued  would think that as an officer you 
would set a good example yet here you are without 
your the alarm will be sounded and you be in 
a pretty position without your  staff officer smiled  
return to your gentlemen all of you all he added 
in a tone of command  prince andrew smiled as 
he looked at the officer who silent and smiling from 
one foot to the other glanced inquiringly with his large 
intelligent kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff officer 
  soldiers say it without said captain smiling in 
his uncomfortable position evidently wishing to a tone but before 
he had finished he felt that his was and had 
not come off he grew confused   return to 
your said the staff officer trying to his gravity  
prince andrew glanced again at the officer small figure there 
was something peculiar about it quite rather but attractive  
the staff officer and prince andrew their horses and on 
 having the village continually meeting and soldiers and officers 
of they saw on their left some being thrown up 
the of which showed up red several of soldiers in 
their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind in these like 
a host of white of red were continually being thrown 
up from behind the bank by unseen hands prince andrew 
and the officer up looked at the and went on 
again just behind it they came upon some of soldiers 
continually replaced by others who ran from the they had 
to hold their and put their horses to a to 
escape from the of these   l des monsieur 
le prince  said the staff officer    
     is a pleasure one gets 
in prince   they up the opposite hill from 
there the french could already be seen prince andrew stopped 
and began the position   our said the staff 
officer indicating the highest point  in of the queer 
fellow we saw without his you can see everything from 
there let go there prince   you very much 
i will go on alone said prince andrew wishing to 
rid himself of this staff officer company  don trouble 
yourself further  the staff officer remained behind and prince 
andrew on alone  the farther forward and nearer the 
he went the more and cheerful were the the greatest 
and had been in the train he had passed that 
morning on the road seven away from the french at 
also some and alarm could be felt but the nearer 
prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident 
was the appearance of our the soldiers in their were 
ranged in lines the major and company officers were counting 
the men the last man in each section in the 
and telling him to hold his hand up soldiers over 
the whole place were and and were building with merry 
chatter and laughter around the sat others dressed and their 
and or or and crowding round the and in one 
company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly 
at the waiting till the which a was carrying in 
a to an officer who sat on a before his 
had been tasted  another company a one for not 
all the had crowded round a broad major who tilting 
a filled one after another the held out to him 
the soldiers lifted the to their lips with faces them 
rolling the in their and walked away from the major 
with brightened expressions their lips and wiping them on the 
sleeves of their all their faces were as serene as 
if all this were at home awaiting and not within 
sight of the before an in which at least half 
of them would be left on the field after passing 
a regiment and in the lines of the fellows busy 
with affairs the of the commander higher than and different 
from the others prince andrew came out in front of 
a of before whom lay a man two soldiers held 
him while two others were their and striking him on 
his bare back the man unnaturally a stout major was 
pacing up and down the line and of the kept 
repeating   a shame for a to a must 
be honorable and but if he his fellows there is 
no honor in him he a go on go on 
 so the sound of the and the desperate but 
unnatural continued   on go on said the major 
 a young officer with a and expression on his 
face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly 
at the adjutant as he by  prince andrew having 
reached the front line along it our front line and 
that of the were far apart on the right and 
left but in the center where the men with a 
flag of truce had passed that morning the lines were 
so near together that the men could see one another 
faces and speak to one another besides the soldiers who 
formed the line on either side there were many who 
and laughing stared at their strange foreign  since early 
morning an not to the line officers had been unable 
to keep sight away the soldiers the line like a 
curiosity no longer looked at the french but paid attention 
to the sight and grew weary waiting to be relieved 
prince andrew to have a look at the french  
 look there one was saying to another pointing to 
a russian who had gone up to the line with 
an officer and was rapidly and talking to a french 
 to him fine isn it it all the can 
do to keep up with him there now   
a bit and listen it fine answered who was considered 
an at french  the to whom the was dolokhov 
prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what 
he was saying dolokhov had come from the left where 
their regiment was with his captain   then go 
on go on the officer bending forward and trying not 
to lose a word of the speech which was to 
him  please more what he saying  dolokhov did 
not answer the captain he had been drawn into a 
hot with the french they were naturally talking about the 
the frenchman the with the russians was trying to prove 
that the russians had and had fled all the way 
from while dolokhov that the russians had not but had 
the french   have orders to drive you off 
here and we shall drive you off said dolokhov  
 take care you and your are not all captured 
said the french  the french and laughed   
make you dance as we did under suvorov  said 
dolokhov         vous 
   est  asked a frenchman   
      he about   
 history said another that it to a former war 
 emperor will your as he has taught the others 
  began dolokhov but the frenchman interrupted him  
 bonaparte he is the emperor cried he angrily  
 devil skin your emperor  and dolokhov at him 
in coarse russian and his walked away   us 
go he said to the captain   that the 
way to talk french said the soldiers  you have 
a try  turning to the french and began to 
meaningless sounds very fast  he said trying to give 
an intonation to his voice   came of such 
and good laughter from the soldiers that it the french 
so much so that the only thing left to do 
seemed to be to the the and all return home 
as quickly as possible  but the remained the in 
and looked out just as and the one another as 
before      chapter xvi   
having round the whole line from right to left prince 
andrew made his way up to the from which the 
staff officer had told him the whole field could be 
seen here he and stopped beside the of the four 
before the an was pacing up and down he stood 
at attention when the officer arrived but at a sign 
resumed his measured monotonous pacing behind the were their and 
still farther back and to the left not far from 
the was a small newly from which came the sound 
of officers voices in eager conversation  it was true 
that a over nearly the whole russian position and the 
greater part of the opened out from this just facing 
it on the of the opposite hill the village of 
could be seen and in three places to left and 
right the french amid the smoke of their the greater 
part of whom were evidently in the village itself and 
behind the hill to the left from that village amid 
the smoke was something a but it was impossible to 
see it clearly with the eye our right was on 
a rather which the french position our infantry were there 
and at the point the in the center where stood 
and from which prince andrew was surveying the position was 
the and most direct and to the brook us from 
on the left our were close to a in which 
smoked the of our infantry who were wood the french 
line was than ours and it was plain that they 
could easily us on both sides behind our position was 
a and deep making it difficult for and cavalry to 
retire prince andrew took out his and on the a 
plan of the position he made some notes on two 
intending to mention them to his idea was first to 
all the in the center and to the cavalry to 
the other side of the prince andrew being always near 
the commander in chief following the movements and general orders 
and constantly accounts of to himself the course of in 
the in broad he imagined only important  the the 
right he said to himself  and the must hold 
their position till from the center come up in that 
case the could make a if they attack our center 
we having the center on this high ground shall the 
left under its and to the by so he all 
the time he had been beside the he had heard 
the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens 
had not understood a word of what they were saying 
suddenly however he was struck by a voice coming from 
the and its tone was so sincere that he could 
not but listen   friend said a pleasant and 
as it seemed to prince andrew a familiar voice  
i say is that if it were possible to know 
what is death none of us would be afraid of 
it that so friend  another a younger voice interrupted 
him  or not you can escape it   
the same one is afraid oh you clever people said 
a third voice interrupting them both  course you men 
are very because you can take everything along with you 
and  and the of the voice evidently an infantry 
officer laughed   one is afraid continued the first 
speaker he of the familiar voice  is afraid of 
the that what it is we may say about the 
soul going to the sky we know there is no 
sky but only an  the voice again interrupted the 
officer   stand us some of your it said 
  thought prince andrew  the captain who stood 
up in the without his he recognized the agreeable voice 
with pleasure   certainly said  still to a 
future life  he did not finish just then there 
was a in the air nearer and nearer and louder 
louder and a ball as if it had not finished 
saying what was necessary into the ground near the with 
human force up a of earth the ground seemed to 
at the terrible  and immediately with a short pipe 
in the corner of his mouth and his kind intelligent 
face rather pale rushed out of the followed by the 
of the voice a infantry officer who hurried off to 
his company up his coat as he ran   
   chapter xvii   his horse again 
prince andrew lingered with the looking at the from the 
that had sent the ball his eyes ran rapidly over 
the wide space but he only saw that the of 
the french now swayed and that there really was a 
to their left the smoke above it had not yet 
dispersed two probably adjutants were up the hill a small 
but distinctly visible was moving down the hill probably to 
the front line the smoke of the first had not 
yet dispersed before another appeared followed by a report the 
battle had prince andrew turned his horse and back to 
to find prince he heard the behind him growing louder 
and more evidently our had to reply from the bottom 
of the where the had taken place came the report 
of  had just arrived at a with bonaparte stern 
letter and and anxious to his had at once moved 
his forces to attack the center and both the russian 
wings before evening and before the arrival of the emperor 
to crush the that stood before him   has 
here it is thought prince andrew feeling the blood rush 
to his heart  where and how will my present 
itself  passing between the that had been and drinking 
a of an hour before he saw everywhere the same 
movement of soldiers ranks and getting their ready and on 
all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled 
his heart  has here it is dreadful but was 
what the face of each and each officer seemed to 
say  before he had reached the that were being 
thrown up he saw in the light of the dull 
evening men coming toward him the wearing a cossack cloak 
and cap and a white horse was prince prince andrew 
stopped waiting for him to come up prince in his 
horse and prince andrew nodded to him he still looked 
while prince andrew told him what he had seen  
the feeling  has here it is was seen even 
on prince hard brown face with its half dull sleepy 
eyes prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that face 
and wished he could tell what if anything this man 
was thinking and feeling at that moment  there anything 
at all behind that face prince andrew asked himself as 
he looked prince bent his head in sign of with 
what prince andrew told him and said  good in 
a tone that seemed to that everything that took place 
and was to him was exactly what he had prince 
andrew out of with his ride spoke quickly prince uttering 
his words with an oriental accent spoke particularly slowly as 
if to the fact that there was no need to 
however he put his horse to a in the direction 
of prince andrew followed with the behind prince an officer 
of the the prince adjutant an officer the staff officer 
on duty a fine horse and a civilian who had 
asked to be present at the battle out of curiosity 
the a stout full man looked around him with a 
naive smile of satisfaction and a strange appearance among the 
hussars and adjutants in his coat as he on his 
horse with a officer   wants to see a 
battle said to bolkonski pointing to the  he a 
in the of his already   leave off said 
the with a beaming but rather smile as if flattered 
at being made the subject of joke and trying to 
appear than he really was   is very strange 
mon monsieur prince said the staff officer  remembered that 
in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a 
prince but could not get it quite right  by 
this time they were all approaching and a ball struck 
the ground in front of them   that that 
has asked the with a naive smile   french 
answered   that what they hit with asked the 
 awful  he seemed to with satisfaction he had 
hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly which 
suddenly ended with a into something soft f and a 
cossack a little to their right and behind the to 
earth with his horse and the staff officer bent over 
their and turned their horses away the stopped facing the 
cossack and examined him with attentive curiosity the cossack was 
dead but the horse still  prince screwed up his 
eyes looked round and seeing the cause of the turned 
away with indifference as if to say  it worth 
while noticing trifles he in his horse with the case 
of a and slightly bending over his saber which had 
caught in his cloak it was an old saber of 
a kind no longer in general use prince andrew remembered 
the story of suvorov giving his saber to in and 
the was particularly pleasant at that moment they had reached 
the at which prince andrew had been when he examined 
the   company asked prince of an standing by 
the  he asked  company but he really meant 
 you frightened here and the understood him   
your excellency shouted the red in a merry voice standing 
to attention   yes muttered as if considering something 
and he past the to the  as he approached 
a ringing from it him and his and in the 
smoke that suddenly the they could see the who had 
seized it to it quickly back to its former position 
a huge broad number one holding a his legs far 
apart to the while number two with a hand placed 
a in the mouth the short round captain stumbling over 
the tail of the carriage moved forward and not noticing 
the general looked out his eyes with his small hand 
  it two lines more and it will be 
just right cried he in a voice to which he 
tried to a note ill to his weak figure  
two he   called to him and raising three 
fingers to his cap with a and awkward gesture not 
at all like a military but like a approached the 
general though had been intended to the valley he was 
balls at the village of visible just opposite in front 
of which large of french were  no one had 
given orders where and at what to fire but after 
his major for whom he had great respect he had 
decided that it would be a good thing to set 
fire to the village  good said in reply to 
the officer report and began deliberately to the whole before 
him the french had on our right below the height 
on which the regiment was in the hollow where the 
the soul rolling and of was heard and much farther 
to the right the the officer of the pointed out 
to a french that was us to the left the 
by the wood prince ordered two from the center to 
be sent to the right the officer of the to 
remark to the prince that if these went away the 
would remain without support prince turned to the officer and 
with his dull eyes looked at him in silence it 
seemed to prince andrew that the officer remark was just 
and that really no answer could be made to it 
but at that moment an adjutant up with a from 
the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news 
that immense of the french were coming down upon them 
and that his regiment was in and was upon the 
prince bowed his head in sign of and approval he 
off at a walk to the right and sent an 
adjutant to the with orders to attack the french but 
this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news 
that the commander of the had already the in the 
ground as a heavy fire had been opened on him 
and he was losing men and so had hastened to 
throw some into the wood   good said  
as he was leaving the was heard on the left 
also and as it was too far to the left 
for him to have time to go there himself prince 
sent to tell the general in command  one who 
had his regiment before kutuzov at that he must as 
quickly as possible behind the hollow in the as the 
right would probably not be able to the attack very 
long about and the that had been in support of 
his all was forgotten prince andrew listened attentively to with 
the officers and the orders he gave them and to 
his surprise found that no orders were really given but 
that prince tried to make it appear that everything done 
by necessity by or by the will of was done 
if not by his direct command at least in accord 
with his intentions prince andrew noticed however that though what 
happened was to and was of the commander will to 
the tact showed his presence was very officers who approached 
him with disturbed became calm soldiers and officers greeted him 
gaily grew more cheerful in his presence and were evidently 
anxious to display their courage before him    
  chapter xviii   prince having reached the 
highest point of our right began to where the of 
was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing 
could be seen the nearer they got to the hollow 
the less they could see but the more they felt 
the of the they began to meet men one with 
a head and no cap was being along by two 
soldiers who him under the arms there was a in 
his and he was blood a had evidently hit him 
in the or mouth another was by himself but without 
his aloud and his arm which had just been hurt 
while blood from it was over his as from a 
bottle he had that moment been and his face showed 
fear rather than suffering crossing a road they a and 
saw several men lying on the ground they also met 
a crowd of soldiers some of whom were the soldiers 
were the hill breathing heavily and despite the general presence 
were talking loudly and gesticulating in front of them rows 
of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke and 
an officer sight of rushed shouting after the crowd of 
soldiers them back up to the ranks along which now 
here and now there the sound of voices and the 
shouts of command the whole air with smoke the faces 
of the soldiers were with it some were using their 
others putting on the or taking from their while others 
were though who they were at could not be seen 
for the smoke which there was no wind to carry 
away a pleasant and of were often heard  is 
this thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers  
can be an attack for they are not moving it 
can be a square they are not drawn up for 
that  the commander of the regiment a thin old 
man with a pleasant smile drooping more than half over 
his old eyes giving him a expression up to and 
him as a host an he that his regiment had 
been attacked by french cavalry and that though the attack 
had been he had lost more than half his men 
he said the attack had been this military to describe 
what had occurred to his regiment but in he did 
not himself know what had happened during that half to 
the to him and could not say with whether the 
attack had been or his regiment had been broken up 
all he knew was that at the of the balls 
and began flying all over his regiment and men and 
that afterwards someone had shouted  and our men had 
they were still not at the cavalry which had but 
at french infantry who had come into the hollow and 
were at our men prince bowed his head as a 
sign that this was exactly what he had desired and 
expected turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring 
down the two of the whom they had just passed 
prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on prince 
face at this moment it expressed the concentrated and happy 
resolution you see on the face of a man who 
on a hot day takes a final run before into 
the water the dull sleepy expression was no longer there 
nor the affectation of profound thought the round steady eyes 
looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on 
anything although his movements were still and measured  the 
commander of the regiment turned to prince him to go 
back as it was too dangerous to remain where they 
were  your excellency for god sake he kept saying 
glancing for support at an officer of the who turned 
away from him  you see and he drew attention 
to the and continually around them he spoke in the 
tone of entreaty and reproach that a to a who 
has picked up an  are used to it but 
you sir will your hands he spoke as if those 
could not kill him and his half eyes gave still 
more to his words the staff officer joined in the 
colonel but did not reply he only gave an order 
to and so as to give room for the two 
approaching while he was speaking the of smoke that had 
the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move 
from right to left as if drawn by an invisible 
hand and the hill opposite with the french moving about 
on it opened out before them all eyes on this 
french against them and down over the ground one could 
already see the soldiers distinguish the officers from the men 
and see the against its staff   march splendidly 
remarked someone in  the head of the had already 
into the hollow the would take place on this side 
of it  the remains of our regiment which had 
been in rapidly formed up and moved to the right 
from behind it the came two of the in fine 
order before they had reached the of the of men 
in step could be heard on their left to a 
company commander a fine round man with a stupid and 
happy expression same man who had rushed out of the 
at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but 
how a fellow he would appear as he passed the 
commander  with the self of a man on he 
stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along 
himself to his full height without the effort his ease 
with the heavy of the soldiers who were keeping step 
with him he carried close to his a sword  
curved and not like a real and looked now at 
the superior officers and now back at the men without 
losing step his whole powerful body turning it was as 
if all the of his soul were concentrated on passing 
the commander in the best possible manner and feeling that 
he was doing it well he was happy  left 
left he seemed to to himself at each step and 
in time to this with stern but faces the wall 
of soldiers with and in step and each one of 
these of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at 
each step  left left a fat major a and 
falling out of step a who had behind his face 
showing alarm at his ran at a to catch up 
with his company a ball the air over the heads 
of and his and fell into the to the measure 
of  left  up came the company commander voice 
in tones the soldiers passed in a round something where 
the ball had and an old on the a officer 
who had stopped beside the dead men ran to catch 
up his line and falling into step with a looked 
back angrily and through the silence and the regular of 
feet the ground in one seemed to hear left left 
left   done said prince   to do 
our best your came a confused from the ranks a 
on the left turned his eyes on as he shouted 
with an expression that seemed to say  know that 
ourselves another without looking round as though fearing to shouted 
with his mouth wide open and passed on  the 
order was given to halt and down  round the 
ranks that had past him and he gave the to 
a cossack took off and over his felt coat his 
legs and set his cap straight the head of the 
french with its officers leading appeared from below the hill 
  with god said in a resolute voice turning 
for a moment to the front line and slightly his 
arms he went forward uneasily over the rough field with 
the awkward of a prince andrew felt that an invisible 
power was leading him forward and experienced great happiness  
the french were already near prince andrew beside could clearly 
distinguish their red and even their faces  distinctly saw 
an old french officer who with legs and turned climbed 
the hill with difficulty prince gave no further orders and 
silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks 
suddenly one after another rang out from the french smoke 
appeared all along their ranks and sounded several of our 
men fell among them the round officer who had so 
gaily and complacently but at the moment the first report 
was heard looked round and shouted    rang 
a long from our ranks and passing and one another 
they rushed in an but joyous and eager crowd down 
the hill at their foe      
chapter xix   the attack of the the of 
our right in the center forgotten which had managed to 
set fire to the village the french the french were 
putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and 
thus gave us time to the of the center to 
the other side of the in the ground at the 
was hurried and but the different did not get mixed 
but our left of the and infantry and the pavlograd 
hussars attacked and by superior french forces under and was 
thrown into had sent to the general that left with 
orders to immediately  not his hand from his cap 
turned his horse about and off but no sooner had 
he left than his courage failed him he was seized 
by and could not go where it was dangerous  
having reached the left instead of going to the front 
where the was he began to look for the general 
and his staff where they could not possibly be and 
so did not the order  the command of the 
left belonged by to the commander of the regiment kutuzov 
had at and in which dolokhov was serving as a 
private but the command of the extreme left had been 
assigned to the commander of the pavlograd regiment in which 
rostov was serving and a the two were much exasperated 
with one another and long after the had on the 
right and the french were already were engaged in with 
the sole object of one another but the both cavalry 
and infantry were by no means ready for the from 
to general they were not expecting a battle and were 
engaged in the cavalry the horses and the infantry collecting 
wood   higher i in rank said the german 
colonel of the hussars flushing and addressing an adjutant who 
had up  let him do what he vill but 
i cannot sacrifice my hussars ze  but was becoming 
and mingling together on the right and in the center 
while the of were already seen crossing the and up 
within twice the of a the general in command of 
the infantry went toward his horse with steps and having 
drew himself up very straight and tall and to the 
pavlograd commander the met with polite bows but with secret 
in their hearts   again colonel said the general 
 can leave half my men in the wood i 
beg of you i beg of you he repeated  
the position and prepare for an attack   of 
you yourself not to in is not your business suddenly 
replied the colonel  you in the cavalry   
am not in the cavalry colonel but i am a 
russian general and if you are not aware of the 
fact   your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching 
his horse and turning in the face  you be 
so goot to come to ze front and see position 
no goot i don to my men for your pleasure 
  forget yourself colonel i am not considering my 
own pleasure and i won allow it to be said 
 taking the colonel outburst as a challenge to his 
courage the general his chest and frowning beside him to 
the front line as if their would be settled there 
the they reached the front several over them and they 
in silence there was nothing fresh to be seen from 
the line for from where they had been before it 
had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to 
act among the and broken ground as well as that 
the french were our left the general and colonel looked 
sternly and significantly at one another like two preparing for 
battle each trying to signs of in the other both 
passed the as there was nothing to be said and 
neither wished to give occasion for it to be that 
he had been the first to leave the of fire 
they would have remained there for a long time each 
other courage had it not been that just then they 
heard the of and a almost behind them in the 
wood the french had attacked the men collecting wood in 
the it was no longer possible for the hussars to 
with the infantry they were cut off from the line 
of on the left by the french however the position 
it was now necessary to attack in order to cut 
away through for themselves  the in which rostov was 
serving had scarcely time to before it was facing the 
again as at the bridge there was nothing between the 
and the and again that terrible line of and fear 
the line the living from the dead between them all 
were conscious of this unseen line and the question whether 
they would cross it or not and how they would 
cross it agitated them all  the colonel to the 
front angrily gave some reply to questions put to him 
by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on 
having his own way gave an order no one said 
anything definite but the of an attack spread through the 
the command to form up rang out and the as 
they were drawn from their still no one moved the 
of the left infantry and hussars alike felt that the 
commander did not himself know what to do and this 
itself to the men   only they would be 
quick thought rostov feeling that at last the time had 
come to experience the joy of an attack of which 
he had so often heard from his fellow hussars  
 with god rang out voice  a  the 
horses began to in the front line pulled at the 
and started of his own accord  before him on 
the right rostov saw the front lines of his hussars 
and still farther a dark line which he could not 
see distinctly but took to be the could be heard 
but some way off   came the word of 
command and rostov felt drooping as he broke into a 
 rostov his horse movements and became more and more 
he had noticed a tree of him this tree had 
been in the middle of the line that had seemed 
so terrible now he had that line and not only 
was there nothing terrible but everything was becoming more and 
more happy and animated  how i will at him 
thought rostov the of his saber   came a 
of voices  anyone come my way now thought rostov 
his spurs into and letting him go at a full 
so that he the others the was already visible suddenly 
something like a seemed to over the rostov raised his 
saber ready to but at that instant the who was 
away from him and rostov felt as in a that 
he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but 
yet stayed on the same spot from behind him an 
hussar he knew against him and looked angrily at him 
horse and past   is it i am not 
moving i have i am killed rostov asked and answered 
at the same instant he was alone in the middle 
of a field instead of the moving horses and hussars 
he saw nothing before him but the earth and the 
around him there was warm blood under his arm  
i am and the horse is killed tried to rise 
on his but fell back his blood was from his 
head he but could not rise rostov also tried to 
rise but fell back his having become in the where 
our men were and where the french he did not 
know there was no one near  having his he 
rose  on which side was now the line that 
had so divided the two he asked himself and could 
not answer  something bad have happened to me he 
wondered as he got up and at that moment he 
felt that something was hanging on his left arm the 
felt as if it were not his he examined his 
hand carefully trying to find blood on it  here 
are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running 
toward him  will help me in front came a 
man wearing a strange and a blue cloak and with 
a nose then came two more and many more running 
behind one of them said something strange not in russian 
in among the of these men wearing was a russian 
hussar he was being held by the arms and his 
horse was being led behind him   must be 
one of ours a yes can it be that they 
will take me too who are these men thought rostov 
scarcely his eyes  they be french he looked at 
the approaching and though but a moment before he had 
been to get at them and them to their now 
seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes 
 are they why are they running can they be 
coming at me and why to kill me me whom 
everyone is so fond of he remembered his mother love 
for him and his family and his friends and the 
intention to kill him seemed impossible  perhaps they may 
do it for more than ten he stood not moving 
from the spot or the situation the frenchman the one 
with the nose was already so close that the expression 
of his face could be seen and the face of 
that man his hanging down holding his and running so 
lightly frightened rostov he seized his and instead of it 
it at the frenchman and ran with all his might 
toward the he did not now run with the feeling 
of doubt and with which he had trodden the bridge 
but with the feeling of a from the one single 
that of fear for his young and happy life possessed 
his whole being rapidly the he fled across the field 
with the impetuosity he used to show at now and 
then turning his good pale young face to look back 
a shudder of went through him  better not look 
he thought but having reached the he glanced round once 
more the french had behind and just as he looked 
round the first man changed his run to a walk 
and turning shouted something loudly to a farther back rostov 
paused  there some mistake thought he  can have 
wanted to kill me but at the same time his 
left arm felt as heavy as if a weight were 
tied to it he could run no more the frenchman 
also stopped and took aim rostov closed his eyes and 
stooped down one and then another past him he his 
last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with 
his right and reached the behind these were some russian 
     chapter xx   the 
infantry that had been caught in the of the wood 
ran out of it the different getting mixed and as 
a crowd one in his fear uttered the cry  
off that is so terrible in battle and that word 
the whole crowd with a feeling of   cut 
off we lost shouted the  the moment he heard 
the and the cry from behind the general realized that 
something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the thought 
that he an officer of many years service who had 
never been to might be held at for or so 
him that forgetting the cavalry colonel his own dignity as 
a general and above all quite forgetting the danger and 
all regard for self he clutched the of his and 
his horse to the regiment under a of which fell 
around but him his one desire was to know what 
was and at any cost correct or the mistake if 
he had made one so that he an officer of 
twenty years service who had never been should not be 
held to  having through the french he reached a 
field behind the across which our men of orders were 
running and the valley that moment of which the fate 
of had arrived would this crowd of soldiers attend to 
the voice of their commander or would they him continue 
their flight despite his desperate shouts that used to seem 
so terrible to the soldiers despite his countenance distorted out 
of all to his former self and the of his 
saber the soldiers all continued to run talking into the 
air and orders the which decided the fate of was 
evidently in a  the general had a fit of 
as a result of shouting and of the smoke and 
stopped in despair everything seemed lost but at that moment 
the french who were suddenly and without any apparent reason 
ran back and from the and russian showed themselves in 
the it was company which alone had its order in 
the wood and having in ambush in a now attacked 
the french unexpectedly only with a sword had rushed at 
the with such a desperate cry and such mad drunken 
that taken by surprise the french had thrown down their 
and run dolokhov running beside killed a frenchman at close 
and was the first to seize the french officer by 
his collar our returned the and the french who had 
nearly cut our left in half were for the moment 
our reserve were able to join up and the fight 
was at an end the commander and major had stopped 
beside a bridge letting the pass by them when a 
came up and took hold of the commander almost against 
him the man was wearing a coat of he had 
no or cap his head was and over his shoulder 
a french was he had an officer sword in his 
hand the was pale his blue eyes looked into the 
commander face and his lips were smiling though the commander 
was occupied in giving to major he could not help 
taking notice of the   excellency here are two 
said dolokhov pointing to the french sword and  have 
taken an officer i stopped the company dolokhov heavily from 
weariness and spoke in sentences  whole company can bear 
witness i beg you will remember this your excellency  
 right all right replied the commander and turned to 
major  but dolokhov did not go away he the 
handkerchief around his head pulled it off and showed the 
blood on his hair   wound i remained at 
the front remember your excellency   had been forgotten 
and only at the very end of the did prince 
still hearing the in the center send his staff officer 
and later prince andrew also to order the to retire 
as quickly as possible when the attached to had been 
moved away in the middle of the by someone order 
the had continued and was only not captured by the 
french because the could not that anyone could have the 
to continue from four quite on the contrary the of 
that led the french to suppose that here the center 
main russian forces were concentrated twice they had to attack 
this point but on each occasion had been driven back 
by from the four on the  soon after prince 
had left him had succeeded in setting fire to  
 at them it burning just see the smoke fine 
grand look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the up 
 all the without waiting for orders were being in 
the direction of the as if each other on the 
soldiers cried at each  that good look at it 
grand the fire by the was rapidly spreading the french 
that had the village went back but as though in 
for this the placed ten to the right of the 
village and began them at  in their childlike by 
the fire and their luck in the french our only 
noticed this when two balls and then four more fell 
among our one over two horses and another off a 
their once roused were however not but only changed character 
the horses were replaced by others from a reserve carriage 
the were carried away and the four were turned against 
the ten companion officer had been killed at the beginning 
of the and within an hour of the forty men 
of the had been but the were still as merry 
and lively as ever twice they noticed the french below 
them and then they at them  little moving feebly 
and awkwardly kept telling his to  my pipe for 
that one and then from it ran forward his eyes 
with his small hand to look at the french  
 at  he kept saying the by the wheels 
and the himself  amid the smoke by the reports 
which always made him jump not taking his pipe from 
his mouth ran from to now aiming now counting the 
now giving orders about dead or horses and fresh ones 
and shouting in his voice so high and his face 
grew more and more animated only when a man was 
killed or did he frown and turn away from the 
sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always 
the case about lifting the or dead the soldiers for 
the most part handsome fellows and as is always the 
case in an company a head and shoulders and twice 
as broad as their officer looked at their commander like 
children in an situation and the expression on his face 
was reflected on  to the terrible and the necessity 
for and did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of 
fear and the thought that he might be killed or 
badly never occurred to him on the contrary he became 
more and more it seemed to him that it was 
a very long time ago almost a day since he 
had first seen the and the first and that the 
corner of the field he stood on was well and 
familiar ground though he thought of everything considered everything and 
did everything the best of officers could do in his 
position he was in a state to or  from 
the sounds of his own around him the and of 
the balls from the flushed and faces of the bustling 
round the from the sight of the blood of men 
and horses from the little of smoke on the side 
 followed by a ball flying past and striking the 
earth a man a a horse from the sight of 
all these things a world of his own had taken 
of his and at that moment him pleasure the were 
in his fancy not but pipes from which were by 
an invisible   he again muttered to himself as 
a small cloud rose from the hill and was in 
a to the left by the wind   look 
out for the ball we throw it back   
do you want your honor asked an standing close by 
who heard him muttering   only a he answered 
  along our he said to himself   
was the name his fancy gave to the of the 
which was large and of an old pattern the french 
round their seemed to him like in that world the 
handsome number one of the second was  looked at 
him more often than at anyone else and took in 
his every movement the sound of at the foot of 
the hill now now seemed like someone breathing he listened 
to the and flow of these sounds    
    daughter of    breathing 
again breathing he muttered to himself  he imagined himself 
as an tall powerful man who was balls at the 
french with both hands   then dear old lady 
don let me down he was saying as he moved 
from the when a strange voice called above his head 
 captain  turned round in dismay it was the 
staff officer who had turned him out of the at 
he was shouting in a voice   you mad 
you have twice been ordered to and you   
are they down on me thought looking in alarm at 
his superior   don he muttered holding up two 
fingers to his cap   but the staff officer 
did not finish what he wanted to say a ball 
flying close to him him to and over his horse 
he paused and just as he was about to say 
something more another ball stopped him he turned his horse 
and off   all to retire he shouted from 
a distance  the soldiers laughed a moment later an 
adjutant arrived with the same order  it was prince 
andrew the first thing he saw on up to the 
space where were was an horse with a broken that 
lay beside the horses blood was from its as from 
a spring among the lay several dead men one ball 
after another passed over as he approached and he felt 
a nervous shudder run down his spine but the mere 
thought of being afraid roused him again  cannot be 
afraid thought he and slowly among the he delivered the 
order and did not leave the he decided to have 
the removed from their positions and in his presence together 
with across the and under a terrible fire from the 
french he attended to the of the   staff 
officer was here a minute ago but off said an 
to prince andrew  like your honor  prince andrew 
said nothing to they were both so busy as to 
seem not to notice one another when having up the 
only two that remained out of the four they began 
moving down the hill  and one were left behind 
prince andrew up to   till we meet again 
he said holding out his hand to   my 
dear fellow said  soul good my dear fellow and 
for some reason tears suddenly filled his eyes   
   chapter   the wind had and 
black merging with the smoke low over the field of 
battle on the it was growing dark and the glow 
of two was the more the was dying down but 
the of behind and on the right sounded and nearer 
as soon as with his continually round or coming upon 
men was out of of fire and had into the 
he was met by some of the staff among them 
the staff officer and who had been twice sent to 
but had never reached it interrupting one another they all 
gave and orders as to how to and him gave 
no orders and silently to speak because at every word 
he felt ready to without knowing why behind on his 
though the orders were to the many of them themselves 
after and begged for seats on the carriages the infantry 
officer who just before the battle had rushed out of 
was laid with a in his on  carriage at 
the foot of the hill a pale hussar cadet one 
hand with the other came up to and asked for 
a seat   for god sake i hurt my 
arm he said timidly  god sake i can walk 
for god sake  it was plain that this cadet 
had already asked for a lift and been refused he 
asked in a piteous voice   them to give 
me a seat for god sake   him a 
seat said  a cloak for him to sit on 
lad he said addressing his favorite  where is the 
officer   has been set down he died replied 
someone   him up sit down dear fellow sit

with one hand he the other he was pale and 
his trembled he was placed on  the from which 
they had removed the dead officer the cloak they spread 
under him was with blood which his breeches and arm 
  are you my lad said approaching the on 
which rostov sat   it a   what 
is this blood on the carriage inquired   was 
the officer your honor it answered the wiping away the 
blood with his coat sleeve as if for the state 
of his  it was all that they could do 
to get the up the rise by the infantry and 
having reached the village of they it had grown so 
dark that one could not distinguish the ten off and 
the had to suddenly near by on the right shouting 
and were again heard of in the this was the 
last french attack and was met by soldiers who had 
in the village they all rushed out of the village 
again but could not move and the and the cadet 
exchanged silent glances as they their fate the died down 
and soldiers talking eagerly out of a side street  
 hurt asked one   given it  hot 
they won make another now said another   couldn 
see a thing how they at their own fellows nothing 
could be seen pitch brother isn there something to drink 
 the french had been for the last time and 
again and again in the complete moved forward by the 
infantry as by a frame  in the it seemed 
as though a gloomy unseen river was always in one 
direction with and talk and the sound of and wheels 
amid the general the and voices of the were more 
distinctly heard than any other sound in the of the 
night the that the army was filled with their which 
seemed to into one with the of the night after 
a while the moving became agitated someone past on a 
white horse followed by his and said something in passing 
 did he say where to now halt is it 
did he thank us came eager questions from all sides 
the whole moving began pressing closer together and a report 
spread that they were ordered to halt evidently those in 
front had all remained where they were in the middle 
of the road  were lighted and the talk became 
more audible captain having given orders to his company sent 
a to find a or a doctor for the cadet 
and sat down by a the soldiers had on the 
road rostov too himself to the fire from cold and 
a shook his whole body was him but he kept 
by an in his arm for which he could find 
no position he kept his eyes and then again looking 
at the fire which seemed to him red and at 
the round figure of who was sitting cross like a 
beside him large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy 
and on rostov who saw that with his whole heart 
wished to help him but could not  from all 
sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry 
who were past and settling down all around the sound 
of voices the feet the horses moving in the of 
wood near and into one  it was no longer 
as before a dark unseen river through the but a 
dark sea and gradually after a rostov looked at and 
listened to what passed before and around him an came 
to the fire on his heels held his hands to 
the and turned away his face   don mind 
your honor he asked  lost my company your honor 
i don know where such bad luck  with the 
an infantry officer with a came up to the and 
addressing asked him to have the moved a to let 
a go past after he had gone two soldiers rushed 
to the they were and desperately each trying to from 
the other a they were both holding on to  
 picked it up i say you very one of 
them shouted  then a thin pale his neck with 
a band came up and in angry tones asked the 
for water   one die like a dog said 
he  told them to give the man some water 
then a cheerful ran up begging a little fire for 
the infantry   nice little hot for the infantry 
good luck to you fellow for the fire return it 
with interest said he carrying away into the a stick 
 next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a 
cloak and passed by the fire one of them  
 the devil has put the on the road he 
  dead carry him said another   up 
 and they into the with their   asked 
rostov in a whisper     honor you 
wanted by the general he is in the here said 
a coming up to   friend  rose and 
his and pulling it straight walked away from the fire 
 not far from the in a that had been 
prepared for him prince sat at dinner talking with some 
officers who had gathered at his the little old man 
with the half eyes was there a and the general 
who had served for twenty years flushed by a glass 
of and the dinner and the staff officer with the 
ring and uneasily glancing at them all and prince andrew 
pale with compressed lips and eyes  in a corner 
of the stood a captured from the french and the 
with the naive face was feeling its shaking his head 
in because the really interested him perhaps because it was 
hard for him as he was to look on at 
a dinner where there was no place for him in 
the next there was a french colonel who had been 
taken by our our officers were in to look at 
him prince was the and inquiring into of the and 
our the general whose regiment had been at was the 
prince that as soon as the began he had from 
the wood the men who were and allowing the french 
to pass him had made a with two and had 
broken up the french   i saw your excellency 
that their first was i stopped in the road and 
thought  let them come on and will meet them 
with the fire of the whole that what i did 
 the general had so wished to do this and 
was so sorry he had not managed to do it 
that it seemed to him as if it had really 
happened perhaps it might really have been so could one 
possibly make out amid all that what did or did 
not happen   the way your excellency i should 
inform you he continued dolokhov conversation with kutuzov and his 
last interview with the private dolokhov who was to the 
ranks took a french officer in my presence and particularly 
distinguished himself   saw the pavlograd hussars attack there 
your excellency chimed in looking uneasily around he had not 
seen the hussars all that day but had heard about 
them from an infantry officer  broke up two squares 
your excellency  several of those present smiled at words 
expecting one of his usual but noticing that what he 
was saying to the glory of our arms and of 
the day work they assumed a serious expression though many 
of them knew that what he was saying was a 
lie of any prince turned to the old colonel  
 i thank you all all arms have behaved infantry 
cavalry and how was it that two were in the 
center he inquired searching with his eyes for someone  
did not ask about the on the left he knew 
that all the there had been at the very beginning 
of the  think i sent you he added turning 
to the staff officer on duty   was answered 
the staff officer  the other i can understand i 
was there all the time giving orders and had only 
just left it is true that it was hot there 
he added modestly  someone mentioned that captain was close 
to the village and had already been sent for  
 but you were there said prince addressing prince andrew 
  course we only just one another said the 
staff officer with a smile to bolkonski   had 
not the pleasure of seeing you said prince andrew coldly 
and  all were silent appeared at the and made 
his way timidly from behind the of the as he 
stepped past the in the crowded feeling as he always 
was by the sight of his he did not notice 
the staff of the and over it several of those 
present laughed   was it a was asked frowning 
not so much at the captain as at those who 
were laughing among whom laughed  only now when he 
was by the stern did his and the of having 
lost two and yet remaining present themselves to in all 
their horror he had been so that he had not 
thought about it until that moment the officers laughter confused 
him still more he stood before with his lower and 
was hardly able to  don know your excellency i 
had no men your excellency   might have taken 
some from the  did not say that there were 
no though that was perfectly true he was afraid of 
getting some other officer into trouble and silently fixed his 
eyes on as a who has looks at an  
the silence some time prince apparently not wishing to be 
severe found nothing to say the others did not to 
prince andrew looked at from under his brows and his 
fingers nervously   excellency prince andrew broke the silence 
with his voice  were pleased to send me to 
captain i went there and found two of the men 
and horses out two smashed and no at all  
prince and looked with equal at bolkonski who spoke with 
suppressed agitation   if your excellency will allow me 
to express my opinion he continued  today success chiefly 
to the of that and the of captain and his 
company and without awaiting a reply prince andrew rose and 
left the table  prince looked at evidently to show 
in bolkonski emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to 
it bent his head and told that he could go 
prince andrew went out with him   you you 
me my dear fellow said  prince andrew gave him 
a look but said nothing and went away he felt 
sad and depressed it was all so strange so unlike 
what he had    are they why are 
they here what do they want and when will all 
this end thought rostov looking at the changing before him 
the in his arm became more and more him red 
rings danced before his eyes and the of those voices 
and faces and a sense of with the it was 
they these soldiers and was they who were down and 
the and the of his arm and shoulder to rid 
himself of them he closed his eyes  for a 
moment he but in that short things appeared to him 
in a his mother and her large white hand sonya 
thin little shoulders natasha eyes and laughter with his voice 
and mustache and and all that affair with and that 
affair was the same thing as this with the voice 
and it was that affair and this that were so 
pulling and pressing his arm and always it in one 
direction he tried to get away from them but they 
would not for an instant let his shoulder move a 
hair it would not would be well only they did 
not pull it but it was impossible to get rid 
of them  he opened his eyes and looked up 
the black of night less than a yard above the 
glow of the of falling snow were in that light 
had not returned the doctor had not come he was 
alone now except for a who was sitting at the 
other side of the fire his thin body   
wants me thought rostov  is no one to help 
me or pity me yet i was once at home 
strong happy and loved he and doing so   
is anything you asked the shaking his shirt out over 
the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave 
a and added  a lot of men have been 
today  rostov did not listen to the he looked 
at the above the fire and remembered a russian winter 
at his warm bright home his coat his quickly his 
body and all the affection and care of his family 
 why did i come here he wondered  next 
day the french army did not their attack and the 
of was to kutuzov army      
book three       chapter i 
  prince vasili was not a man who deliberately 
thought out his still less did he think of anyone 
for his own he was merely a man of the 
world who had got on and to whom getting on 
had become a habit and for which he never rightly 
to himself but which formed the whole interest of his 
life were constantly themselves in his mind from the circumstances 
and persons he met of these he had not merely 
one or two in his head but some only beginning 
to form themselves some approaching and some in course of 
he did not for say to himself  man now 
has influence i must gain his confidence and friendship and 
through him obtain a special grant nor did he say 
to himself  is a rich man i must him 
to marry my daughter and me the forty thousand rubles 
i need but when he came across a man of 
position his immediately told him that this man could be 
and without any prince vasili took the first opportunity to 
gain his confidence him become intimate with him and finally 
make his request  he had pierre at hand in 
moscow and for him an appointment as of the which 
at that time the of of state and on the 
young man him to petersburg and staying at his house 
with apparent absent yet with assurance that he was doing 
the right thing prince vasili did everything to get pierre 
to marry his daughter had he thought out his he 
could not have been so natural and shown such familiarity 
in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in 
social standing something always drew him toward those and more 
powerful than himself and he had rare in the most 
moment for making use of people  pierre on unexpectedly 
becoming count bezukhov and a rich man felt himself after 
his and freedom from cares so and that only in 
bed was he able to be by himself he had 
to sign papers to present himself at government the purpose 
of which was not clear to him to question his 
chief to visit his near moscow and to receive many 
people who did not even wish to know of his 
but would now have been offended and had he not 
to see them these different people relations and alike all 
disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly 
and manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of pierre 
noble qualities he was always hearing such words as  
your kindness or  your excellent heart  are yourself 
so honorable count or  he as clever as you 
and so on till he began sincerely to believe in 
his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so 
as in the of his heart it had always seemed 
to him that he really was very kind and intelligent 
even people who had been spiteful toward him and evidently 
now became gentle and affectionate the angry eldest princess with 
the long and hair down like a doll had come 
into pierre room after the with drooping eyes and she 
told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings 
and did not now feel she had a right to 
ask him for anything except only for after the blow 
she had received to remain for a few longer in 
the house she so loved and where she had so 
much she could not refrain from weeping at these words 
touched that this princess could so change pierre took her 
hand and begged her forgiveness without knowing what for from 
that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and 
began a scarf for him   this for my 
sake mon cher after all she had to put up 
with a great deal from the said prince vasili to 
him him a deed to sign for the princess  
prince vasili had come to the that it was necessary 
to throw this bill for thirty thousand rubles the poor 
princess that it might not occur to her to speak 
of his in the affair of the pierre the deed 
and after that the princess grew still the younger sisters 
also became affectionate to him especially the youngest the pretty 
one with the mole who often made him feel confused 
by her smiles and her own when meeting him  
it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like 
him and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone 
him that he could not but believe in the of 
those around him besides he had no time to ask 
himself whether these people were sincere or not he was 
always busy and always felt in a state of and 
cheerful he felt as though he were the center of 
some important and general movement that something was constantly expected 
of him that if he did not do it he 
would and disappoint many people but if he did this 
and that all would be well and he did what 
was demanded of him but still that happy result always 
remained in the future  more than anyone else prince 
vasili took of pierre affairs and of pierre himself in 
those early days from the death of count bezukhov he 
did not let go his hold of the lad he 
had the air of a man by business weary and 
suffering who yet would not for pity sake leave this 
youth who after all was the son of his old 
friend and the of such enormous wealth to the of 
fate and the of during the few days he spent 
in moscow after the death of count bezukhov he would 
call pierre or go to him himself and tell him 
what ought to be done in a tone of weariness 
and assurance as if he were adding every time  
know i am with business and it is out of 
that i trouble myself about you and you also know 
quite well that what i is the only thing possible 
  my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at 
last said prince vasili one day his eyes and pierre 
elbow speaking as if he were saying something which had 
long since been agreed upon and could not now be 
altered  start tomorrow and i giving you a place 
in my carriage i am very glad all our important 
business here is now settled and i ought to have 
been off long ago here is something i have received 
from the i asked him for you and you have 
been entered in the corps and made a of the 
the career now lies open before you  the tone 
of wearied assurance with which these words were pierre who 
had so long been considering his career wished to make 
some but prince vasili interrupted him in the special deep 
tone the of interrupting his speech which he used in 
extreme when special was   mon cher i did 
this for my own sake to my conscience and there 
is nothing to thank me for no one has ever 
yet of being too much loved and besides you are 
free you could throw it up tomorrow but you will 
see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg it 
is high time for you to get away from these 
terrible prince vasili  yes my boy and my can 
go in your carriage ah i was nearly forgetting he 
added  know mon cher your father and i had 
some accounts to so i have received what was from 
the and will keep it you won it we go 
into the accounts later  by  was from the 
prince vasili meant several thousand rubles received from pierre which 
the prince had retained for himself  in petersburg as 
in moscow pierre found the same of and affection he 
could not refuse the post or rather the rank  
he did nothing that prince vasili had for him and 
invitations and social were so that even more than in 
moscow he felt a sense of and continual of some 
good always in front of him but never  of 
his former bachelor many were no longer in petersburg the 
guards had gone to the front dolokhov had been to 
the ranks anatole was in the army somewhere in the 
prince andrew was abroad so pierre had not the opportunity 
to spend his as he used to like to spend 
them or to open his mind by intimate with a 
friend older than himself and whom he respected his whole 
time was taken up with and balls and was spent 
chiefly at prince vasili house in the company of the 
stout princess his wife and his beautiful daughter helene  
like the others anna pavlovna scherer showed pierre the change 
of attitude toward him that had taken place in society 
 in anna pavlovna presence pierre had always felt that 
what he was saying was out of place and that 
remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in 
his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them 
while on the contrary hippolyte remarks came out clever and 
now everything pierre said was charmant even if anna pavlovna 
did not say so he could see that she wished 
to and only refrained out of regard for his  
in the beginning of the winter of  pierre received 
one of anna pavlovna usual pink notes with an invitation 
to which was added  will find the beautiful helene 
here whom it is always delightful to see  when 
he read that sentence pierre felt for the first time 
that some which other people recognized had grown up between 
himself and helene and that thought both alarmed him as 
if some obligation were being on him which he could 
not fulfill and pleased him as an  anna pavlovna 
 home was like the former one only the she 
offered her guests this time was not mortemart but a 
diplomatist fresh from with the very latest of the emperor 
alexander visit to and of how the two august friends 
had themselves in an alliance to the cause of against 
the of the human race anna pavlovna received pierre with 
a of melancholy evidently to the young man by the 
death of count bezukhov  constantly considered it a duty 
to assure pierre that he was greatly by the death 
of the father he had hardly known and her melancholy 
was just like the august melancholy she showed at the 
mention of her most august majesty the empress marya fedorovna 
pierre felt flattered by this anna pavlovna arranged the different 
groups in her drawing room with her habitual the large 
group in which were prince vasili and the had the 
of the diplomat another group was at the tea table 
pierre wished to join the former but anna pavlovna was 
in the condition of a commander on a to whom 
thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is 
hardly time to put in pierre touched his sleeve with 
her finger saying   a bit i have something 
in for you this evening  glanced at helene and 
smiled at her  dear helene be to my poor 
aunt who you go and keep her company for ten 
minutes and that it will not be too dull here 
is the dear count who will not refuse to you 
 the beauty went to the aunt but anna pavlovna 
detained pierre looking as if she had to give some 
final necessary   she she said to pierre pointing 
to the beauty as she away  how she herself 
for so young a girl such tact such perfection of 
manner it comes from her heart happy the man who 
her with her the least of men would a most 
brilliant position in society don you think so i only 
wanted to know your opinion and anna pavlovna let pierre 
go  pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as 
to helene perfection of manner if he ever thought of 
helene it was just of her beauty and her in 
silently dignified in society  the old aunt received the 
two young people in her corner but seemed of hiding 
her adoration for helene and inclined rather to show her 
fear of anna pavlovna she looked at her niece as 
if inquiring what she was to do with these people 
on leaving them anna pavlovna again touched pierre sleeve saying 
 hope you won say that it is dull in 
my house again and she glanced at helene  helene 
smiled with a look that she did not admit the 
of anyone seeing her without being enchanted the aunt and 
said in french that she was very pleased to see 
helene then she turned to pierre with the same words 
of and the same look in the middle of a 
dull and conversation helene turned to pierre with the beautiful 
bright smile that she gave to everyone pierre was so 
used to that smile and it had so little meaning 
for him that he paid no attention to it the 
aunt was just speaking of a collection of that had 
belonged to pierre father count bezukhov and showed them her 
own box princess helene asked to see the portrait of 
the aunt husband on the box   is probably 
the work of said pierre a celebrated and he leaned 
over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to 
hear what was being said at the other table  
he half rose meaning to go round but the aunt 
him the snuffbox passing it across helene back helene stooped 
forward to make room and looked round with a smile 
she was as always at evening parties wearing a dress 
such as was then fashionable cut very low at front 
and back her which had always seemed like marble to 
pierre was so close to him that his eyes could 
not but the living of her neck and shoulders so 
near to his lips that he need only have bent 
his head a little to have touched them he was 
conscious of the of her body the of and the 
of her as she moved he did not see her 
marble beauty a complete whole with her dress but all 
the of her body only covered by her and having 
once seen this he could not help being aware of 
it just as we cannot an we have once seen 
through   you have never noticed before how beautiful 
i am helene seemed to say  had not noticed 
that i am a woman yes i am a woman 
who may belong to anyone you too said her glance 
and at that moment pierre felt that helene not only 
could but must be his wife and that it could 
not be  he knew this at that moment as 
as if he had been standing at the with her 
how and when this would be he did not know 
he did not even know if it would be a 
good thing  even felt he knew not why that 
it would be a bad thing but he knew it 
would happen  pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again 
and wished once more to see her as a beauty 
far removed from him as he had seen her every 
day until then but he could no longer do it 
he could not any more than a man who has 
been looking at a of grass through the and taking 
it for a tree can again take it for a 
tree after he has once recognized it to be a 
of grass she was close to him she already had 
power over him and between them there was no longer 
any except the of his own will   i 
will leave you in your little corner came anna pavlovna 
voice  see you are all right there  and 
pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything 
looked round with a blush it seemed to him that 
everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew 
it himself  a little later when he went up 
to the large circle anna pavlovna said to him  
hear you are your petersburg house  this was true 
the had told him that it was necessary and pierre 
without knowing why was having his enormous petersburg house done 
up   a good thing but don move from 
prince vasili it is good to have a friend like 
the prince she said smiling at prince vasili  know 
something about that don i and you are still so 
young you need advice don be angry with me for 
an old woman privilege  she paused as women always 
do expecting something after they have mentioned their age  
you marry it will be a different thing she continued 
them both in one glance pierre did not look at 
helene nor she at him but she was just as 
close to him he muttered something and  when he 
got home he could not sleep for a long time 
for thinking of what had happened what had happened nothing 
he had merely understood that the woman he had known 
as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned 
he had said absent  she good looking he had 
understood that this woman might belong to him   
she stupid i have myself said she is stupid he 
thought  is something something wrong in the feeling she 
in me i have been told that her brother anatole 
was in love with her and she with him that 
there was quite a scandal and that that why he 
was sent away hippolyte is her brother prince vasili is 
her father it bad he reflected but while he was 
thinking this  was still he caught himself smiling and 
was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up 
and while thinking of her he was also of how 
she would be his wife how she would love him 
become quite different and how all he had thought and 
heard of her might be and he again saw her 
not as the daughter of prince vasili but her whole 
body only veiled by its gray dress  no why 
did this thought never occur to me before and again 
he told himself that it was impossible that there would 
be something unnatural and as it seemed to him in 
this he recalled her former words and looks and the 
words and looks of those who had seen them together 
he recalled anna pavlovna words and looks when she spoke 
to him about his house recalled thousands of such from 
prince vasili and others and was seized by he had 
already in some way himself to do something that was 
evidently wrong and that he ought not to do but 
at the very time he was expressing this conviction to 
himself in another part of his mind her rose in 
all its womanly beauty      chapter 
ii   in  prince vasili had to go 
on a of inspection in four different he had arranged 
this for himself so as to visit his estates at 
the same time and pick up his son anatole where 
his regiment was and take him to visit prince nicholas 
bolkonski in order to arrange a match for him with 
the daughter of that rich old man but before leaving 
home and these new affairs prince vasili had to matters 
with pierre who it is true had spent whole days 
at home that is in prince vasili house where he 
was staying and had been absurd and foolish in helene 
presence  a should be but had not yet to 
her   is all very fine but things must 
be settled said prince vasili to himself with a sigh 
one morning feeling that pierre who was under such to 
him  never mind that was not behaving very well 
in this matter  well god be with him thought 
he his own goodness of heart  it must be 
brought to a head the day after tomorrow will be 
name day i will invite two or three people and 
if he does not understand what he ought to do 
then it will be my affair my affair i am 
her father  six after anna pavlovna  home and 
after the night when he had decided that to marry 
helene would be a and that he ought to avoid 
her and go away pierre despite that decision had not 
left prince vasili and felt with that in people eyes 
he was every day more and more connected with her 
that it was impossible for him to return to his 
former of her that he could not break away from 
her and that though it would be a terrible thing 
he would have to his fate with hers he might 
perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince 
vasili  had before given receptions now hardly let a 
day go by without having an evening party at which 
pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil 
the general pleasure and disappoint everyone prince vasili in the 
rare moments when he was at home would take pierre 
hand in passing and draw it downwards or absent hold 
out his wrinkled clean for pierre to kiss and would 
say  tomorrow or  in to dinner or i 
shall not see you or  am staying in for 
your sake and so on and though prince vasili when 
he stayed in  he said for pierre sake hardly 
exchanged a of words with him pierre felt unable to 
disappoint him every day he said to himself one and 
the same thing  is time i understood her and 
made up my mind what she really is was i 
mistaken before or am i mistaken now no she is 
not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said 
to himself  never makes a mistake never says anything 
stupid she says little but what she does say is 
always clear and simple so she is not stupid she 
never was and is not now so she cannot be 
a bad woman he had often to make reflections or 
think aloud in her company and she had always answered 
him either by a but appropriate remark that it did 
not interest her by a silent look and smile which 
more than anything else showed pierre her superiority she was 
right in regarding all as nonsense in with that smile 
 she always addressed him with a radiantly smile meant 
for him alone in which there was something more significant 
than in the general smile that usually brightened her face 
pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say 
a word and cross a certain line and he knew 
that sooner or later he would step across it but 
an seized him at the thought of that dreadful step 
a thousand times during that month and a half while 
he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful 
pierre said to himself  am i doing i need 
resolution can it be that i have none  he 
wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that 
in this matter he lacked that strength of will which 
he had known in himself and really possessed pierre was 
one of those who are only strong when they feel 
themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was 
by a feeling of desire while over the snuffbox at 
anna pavlovna an sense of the of that desire his 
will  on helene name day a small party of 
just their own people his wife said for supper at 
prince vasili all these friends and relations had been given 
to understand that the fate of the young girl would 
be decided that evening the visitors were seated at supper 
princess a portly woman who had once been handsome was 
sitting at the head of the table on either side 
of her sat the more important guests old general and 
his wife and anna pavlovna scherer at the other end 
sat the younger and less important guests and there too 
sat the members of the family and pierre and helene 
side by side prince vasili was not having any supper 
he went round the table in a merry mood sitting 
down now by one now by another of the guests 
to each of them he made some careless and agreeable 
remark except to pierre and helene whose presence he seemed 
not to notice he the whole party the candles the 
silver and crystal so did the ladies and the gold 
and silver of the men in scarlet moved round the 
table the clatter of knives and glasses mingled with the 
animated of several conversations at one end of the table 
the old was heard an old that he loved her 
passionately at which she laughed at the other could be 
heard the story of the of some mary or other 
at the center of the table prince vasili everybody attention 
with a smile on his face he was telling the 
ladies about last wednesday meeting of the imperial at which 
the new military general of petersburg had received and read 
the then famous of the emperor alexander from the army 
to in which the emperor said that he was receiving 
from all sides of the people that the declaration from 
petersburg gave him particular pleasure and that he was proud 
to be at the head of such a nation and 
would to be worthy of it this began with the 
words  from all sides reports reach me   
and so he never got farther than  asked one 
of the ladies   not a hair farther answered 
prince vasili laughing  from all sides from all sides 
poor could not get any farther he began the again 
and again but as soon as he uttered  he 
sobbed  tears and  all sides was in and 
he could get no farther and again his handkerchief and 
again  from all sides and tears till at last 
somebody else was asked to read it   from 
all sides and then tears someone repeated laughing   
be cried anna pavlovna from her end of the table 
holding up a threatening finger  is such a worthy 
and excellent man our dear  everybody laughed a great 
deal at the head of the table where the guests 
sat everyone seemed to be in high and under the 
influence of a of exciting only pierre and helene sat 
silently side by side almost at the bottom of the 
table a suppressed smile both their faces a smile that 
had nothing to do with smile of at their own 
but much as all the rest laughed talked and much 
as they enjoyed their wine saute and ices and however 
they looking at the young and and as they seemed 
of them one could feel by the glances they gave 
that the story about the laughter and the food were 
all a pretense and that the whole attention of that 
company was to and helene prince vasili the sobbing of 
and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his 
daughter and while he laughed the expression on his face 
clearly said  it getting on it will all be 
settled today anna pavlovna him on behalf of  dear 
and in her eyes which for an instant glanced at 
pierre prince vasili read a on his future son and 
on his daughter happiness the old princess sadly as she 
offered some wine to the old lady next to her 
and glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed 
to say  there nothing left for you and me 
but to sweet wine my dear now that the time 
has come for these young ones to be thus boldly 
happy  what nonsense all this is that i am 
saying thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of 
the  happiness  into the insignificant and artificial interests 
that society had entered the simple feeling of the of 
a and handsome young man and woman for one another 
and this human feeling everything else and above all their 
affected chatter fell flat news was not interesting and the 
animation was evidently forced not only the guests but even 
the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this and 
they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful 
helene with her radiant face and at the red broad 
and happy though uneasy face of pierre it seemed as 
if the very light of the candles was on those 
two happy faces alone  pierre felt that he was 
the center of it all and this both pleased and 
him he was like a man entirely in some occupation 
he did not see hear or understand anything clearly only 
now and then ideas and from the world of unexpectedly 
through his mind   it is all finished he 
thought  how has it all happened how quickly now 
i know that not because of her alone nor of 
myself alone but because of everyone it must come about 
they are all expecting it they are so sure that 
it will happen that i cannot i cannot disappoint them 
but how will it be i do not know but 
it will certainly happen thought pierre glancing at those shoulders 
close to his eyes  or he would suddenly feel 
ashamed of he knew not what he felt it awkward 
to attract everyone attention and to be considered a man 
and with his plain face to be looked on as 
a sort of paris possessed of a  no doubt 
it always is and must be so he himself  
besides what have i done to bring it about how 
did it begin i from moscow with prince vasili then 
there was nothing so why should i not stay at 
his house then i played cards with her and picked 
up her reticule and drove out with her how did 
it begin when did it all come about and here 
he was sitting by her side as her seeing hearing 
feeling her her breathing her movements her beauty then it 
would suddenly seem to him that it was not she 
but he was so beautiful and that that was why 
they all looked so at him and flattered by this 
general he would his chest his head and rejoice at 
his good fortune suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating 
something to him a second time but pierre was so 
that he did not understand what was said   
am asking you when you last heard from bolkonski repeated 
prince vasili a third time  absent you are my 
dear fellow  prince vasili smiled and pierre noticed that 
everyone was smiling at him and helene  what of 
it if you all know it thought pierre  of 
it it the truth and he himself smiled his gentle 
childlike smile and helene smiled too   did you 
get the letter was it from repeated prince vasili who 
pretended to want to know this in order to a 
  can one talk or think of such trifles 
thought pierre   from he answered with a sigh 
 after supper pierre with his partner followed the others 
into the drawing room the guests began to some without 
taking leave of helene some as if to her from 
an important occupation came up to her for a moment 
and made to go away to let her see them 
off the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left 
the drawing room he the vanity of his career in 
with pierre happiness the old general at his wife when 
she asked how his was  the old fool he 
thought  princess helene will be beautiful still when she 
fifty   think i may congratulate you whispered anna 
pavlovna to the old princess kissing her  i this 
i have stayed longer  the old princess did not 
reply she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter happiness 
 while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained 
for a long time alone with helene in the little 
drawing room where they were sitting he had often before 
during the last six remained alone with her but had 
never spoken to her of love now he felt that 
it was but he could not make up his mind 
to take the final step he felt ashamed he felt 
that he was occupying someone else place here beside helene 
 happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered 
to him  happiness is for those who have not 
in them what there is in you  but as 
he had to say something he began by asking her 
whether she was satisfied with the party she replied in 
her usual simple manner that this name day of hers 
had been one of the she had ever had  
some of the relatives had not yet left they were 
sitting in the large drawing room prince vasili came up 
to pierre with footsteps pierre rose and said it was 
getting late prince vasili gave him a look of stern 
inquiry as though what pierre had just said was so 
strange that one could not take it in but then 
the expression of severity changed and he drew pierre hand 
downwards made him sit down and smiled affectionately   
he asked turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her 
with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents 
who have their children from but which prince vasili had 
only by other parents  and he again turned to 
pierre   all sides he said the top of 
his waistcoat  pierre smiled but his smile showed that 
he knew it was not the story about that interested 
prince vasili just then and prince vasili saw that pierre 
knew this he suddenly muttered something and went away it 
seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted the 
sight of the of that old man of the world 
touched pierre he looked at helene and she too seemed 
disconcerted and her look seemed to say  it is 
your own   step must be taken but i 
cannot i cannot thought pierre and he again began speaking 
about indifferent matters about asking what the point of the 
story was as he had not heard it properly helene 
answered with a smile that she too had it  
when prince vasili returned to the drawing room the princess 
his wife was talking in low tones to the elderly 
lady about pierre   course it is a very 
brilliant match but happiness my dear   are made 
in heaven replied the elderly lady  prince vasili passed 
by not to hear the ladies and sat down on 
a sofa in a far corner of the room he 
closed his eyes and seemed to be his head forward 
and then he roused himself   he said to 
his wife  and see what they are about  
the princess went up to the door passed by it 
with a dignified and indifferent air and glanced into the 
little drawing room pierre and helene still sat talking just 
as before   the same she said to her 
husband  prince vasili frowned his mouth his quivered and 
his face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him 
shaking himself he rose threw back his head and with 
resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing 
room with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre 
his face was so that pierre rose in alarm on 
seeing it   god said prince vasili  wife 
has told me everything  put one arm around pierre 
and the other around his daughter dear boy i am 
very pleased  voice trembled  loved your father and 
she will make you a good wife god you  
he embraced his daughter and then again pierre and kissed 
him with his mouth tears his   come here 
he shouted  the old princess came in and also 
wept the elderly lady was using her handkerchief too pierre 
was kissed and he kissed the beautiful helene hand several 
times after a while they were left alone again  
 this had to be and could not be thought 
pierre  it is to ask whether it is good 
or bad it is good because it definite and one 
is rid of the old doubt pierre held the hand 
of his in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as 
it rose and fell   he said aloud and 
paused   special is always said in such he 
thought but could not remember what it was that people 
say he looked at her face she drew nearer to 
him her face flushed   take those off those 
she said pointing to his spectacles  pierre took them 
off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have 
from which spectacles have just been removed had also a 
frightened and inquiring look he was about to over her 
hand and kiss it but with a almost movement of 
her head she his lips and met them with her 
own her face struck pierre by its altered expression  
 is too late now it done besides i love 
her thought pierre   vous  he said what 
has to be said at such moments but his words 
sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself  
       love you  
 six later he was married and settled in count 
bezukhov large newly petersburg house the happy as people said 
of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of 
millions of money      chapter iii 
  old prince nicholas bolkonski received a letter from 
prince vasili in  that he and his son would 
be paying him a visit  am starting on a 
of inspection and of course i shall think nothing of 
an to come and see you at the same time 
my benefactor wrote prince vasili  son anatole is me 
on his way to the army so i hope you 
will allow him personally to express the deep respect that 
his father he for you   seems that there 
will be no need to bring mary out are coming 
to us of their own accord remarked the little princess 
on hearing the news  prince nicholas frowned but said 
nothing  a after the letter prince vasili came one 
evening in of him and he and his son arrived 
next day  old bolkonski had always had a poor 
opinion of prince vasili character but more so recently since 
in the new of and alexander prince vasili had to 
high position and and now from the in his letter 
and given by the little princess he saw which way 
the wind was and his low opinion changed into a 
feeling of ill will he whenever he mentioned him on 
the day of prince vasili arrival prince bolkonski was particularly 
and out of whether he was in a bad because 
prince vasili was coming or whether his being in a 
bad made him specially at prince vasili visit he was 
in a bad and in the morning had already the 
not to go to the prince with his report  
 you hear how he said drawing the attention to 
the sound of the prince footsteps  flat on his 
heels know what that means  however at nine o 
the prince in his velvet coat with a collar and 
cap went out for his usual walk it had the 
day before and the path to the along which the 
prince was in the habit of had been the of 
the were still visible in the snow and a had 
been left sticking in one of the soft that both 
sides of the path the prince went through the the 
serfs and the frowning and silent   a pass 
he asked his a man his in manners and looks 
who was him back to the house   snow 
is deep i am having the your honor  the 
prince bowed his head and went up to the porch 
 be thanked thought the  has over   
would have been hard to drive up your honor he 
added  heard your honor that a is coming to 
visit your honor  the prince turned round to the 
and fixed his eyes on him frowning   a 
what who gave orders he said in his voice  
road is not for the princess my daughter but for 
a for me there are no ministers   honor 
i thought   thought shouted the prince his words 
coming more and more rapidly and  thought i you 
to think and lifting his stick he swung it and 
would have hit the had not the latter the blow 
 shouted the prince rapidly  but although frightened at 
his own in the came up to the prince his 
bald head before him or perhaps for that very reason 
the prince though he continued to  throw the snow 
back on the road did not lift his stick again 
but hurried into the house  before dinner princess mary 
and mademoiselle who knew that the prince was in a 
bad stood awaiting him mademoiselle with a radiant face that 
said  know nothing i am the same as usual 
and princess mary pale frightened and with eyes what she 
found to bear was to know that on such she 
ought to behave like mademoiselle but could not she thought 
 i seem not to notice he will think that 
i do not with him if i seem sad and 
out of myself he will say  he has done 
before that i in the  the prince looked at 
his daughter frightened face and   or he muttered 
  the other one is not here they been 
telling he thought to the little princess who was not 
in the dining room   is the princess he 
asked    is not very well answered mademoiselle 
with a bright smile  she won come down it 
is natural in her state   muttered the prince 
sitting down  his plate seemed to him not quite 
clean and pointing to a spot he it away caught 
it and it to a footman the little princess was 
not but had such an fear of the prince that 
hearing he was in a bad she had decided not 
to appear   am afraid for the baby she 
said to mademoiselle  knows what a might do  
in general at bald hills the little princess lived in 
constant fear and with a sense of to the old 
prince which she did not because the fear was so 
much the feeling the prince this but it was by 
his for her when the little princess had grown accustomed 
to life at bald hills she took a special fancy 
to mademoiselle spent whole days with her asked her to 
sleep in her room and often talked with her about 
the old prince and him   we are to 
have visitors mon prince remarked mademoiselle unfolding her white napkin 
with her rosy fingers  excellency prince vasili kuragin and 
his son i understand she said inquiringly   excellency

you today eh afraid of the  as that idiot 
called him this morning   mon  though mademoiselle 
had been so in her choice of a subject she 
did not stop talking but about the and the beauty 
of a flower that had just opened and after the 
the prince became more  after dinner he went to 
see his daughter the little princess was sitting at a 
small table with her maid she grew pale on seeing 
her father  she was much altered she was now 
plain rather than pretty her had her lip was drawn 
up and her eyes drawn down   i feel 
a kind of she said in reply to the prince 
question as to how she felt   you want

 he left the room and went to the waiting 
room where stood with bowed head   the snow

interrupted the prince and laughing his unnatural way he out 
his hand for to kiss and then to his study 
 prince vasili arrived that evening he was met in 
the by and footmen who with loud shouts his up 
to one of the over the road with snow  
prince vasili and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them 
 anatole having taken off his sat with arms before 
a table on a corner of which he smilingly and 
absent fixed his large and handsome eyes he regarded his 
whole life as a continual round of which someone for 
some reason had to provide for him and he looked 
on this visit to a old man and a rich 
and ugly in the same way all this might he 
thought turn out very well and  why not marry 
her if she really has so much money that never 
does any thought anatole  he and scented himself with 
the care and which had become habitual to him and 
his handsome head held high entered his father room with 
the good and victorious air natural to him prince vasili 
two were busy him and he looked round with much 
animation and nodded to his son as the latter entered 
as if to say  that how i want you 
to look   say father apart is she very 
anatole asked as if continuing a conversation the subject of 
which had often been mentioned during the   what 
nonsense above all try to be and with the old 
prince   he a row i go away said

 for you everything depends on this  in the 
not only was it known in the rooms that the 
and his son had arrived but the appearance of both 
had been described princess mary was sitting alone in her 
room trying to her agitation   did they write 
why did lise tell me about it it can never 
happen she said looking at herself in the glass  
shall i enter the drawing room even if i like 
him i can now be myself with him the mere 
thought of her father look filled her with the little 
princess and mademoiselle had already received from the lady maid 
the necessary report of how handsome the son was with 
his rosy and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty the 
father had his legs upstairs while the son had followed 
him like an three steps at a time having received 
this information the little princess and mademoiselle whose voices had 
reached her from the went into princess mary room  
 know they come said the little princess waddling in 
and heavily into an armchair  she was no longer 
in the gown she generally wore in the morning but 
had on one of her best dresses her hair was 
carefully done and her face was animated which however did 
not its and faded dressed as she used to be 
in petersburg society it was still more how much she 
had become some touch had been added to mademoiselle which 
her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive   
are you going to remain as you are dear princess 
she began  be that the gentlemen are in the 
drawing room and we shall have to go down and 
you have not yourself up at all  the little 
princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and 
merrily began to and carry out a plan of how 
princess mary should be dressed princess mary self was by 
the fact that the arrival of a agitated her and 
still more so by both her not having the least 
that it could be to tell them that she felt 
ashamed for herself and for them would be to her 
agitation while to their to dress her would their and 
she flushed her beautiful eyes grew red came on her 
face and it took on the expression it so often 
wore as she herself to mademoiselle and lise both these 
women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty she 
was so plain that neither of them could think of 
her as a rival so they began her with and 
with the naive and firm conviction women have that dress 
can make a face pretty   really my dear 
this dress is not pretty said lise looking sideways at 
princess mary from a little distance  have a dress 
have it really you know the fate of your whole 
life may be at stake but this one is too 
light it not becoming  it was not the dress 
but the face and whole figure of princess mary that 
was not pretty but neither mademoiselle nor the little princess 
felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon 
were placed in the hair the hair up and the 
blue scarf arranged lower on the best dress and so 
on all would be well they forgot that the frightened 
face and the figure could not be altered and that 
however they might change the setting and of that face 
it would still remain piteous and plain after two or 
three to which princess mary just as her hair had 
been arranged on the top of her head  style 
that quite altered and spoiled her looks and she had 
put on a dress with a pale scarf the little 
princess walked twice round her now adjusting a of the 
dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and 
looking at her with her head bent first on one 
side and then on the other   it will 
not do she said her hands  mary really this 
dress does not suit you i you in your little 
gray dress now please do it for my sake she 
said to the maid  the princess her gray dress 
and you see mademoiselle how i shall arrange it she 
added smiling with a of pleasure  but when brought 
the dress princess mary remained sitting before the glass looking 
at her face and saw in the mirror her eyes 
full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst 
into   dear princess said mademoiselle  one more 
little effort  the little princess taking the dress from 
the maid came up to princess mary   now 
we arrange something quite simple and becoming she said  
the three voices hers mademoiselle and who was laughing at 
something mingled in a merry sound like the of birds 
  leave me alone said princess mary  her 
voice sounded so serious and so sad that the of 
the birds was at once they looked at the beautiful 
large thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing 
and imploringly at them and understood that it was and 
even cruel to   least change your said the 
little princess  i tell you she went on turning 
to mademoiselle  is a face which such a does 
not suit in the least not in the least please 
change it   me alone please leave me alone 
it is all quite the same to me answered a 
voice with tears  mademoiselle and the little princess had 
to own to themselves that princess mary in this looked 
very plain worse than usual but it was too late 
she was looking at them with an expression they both 
knew an expression thoughtful and sad this expression in princess 
mary did not them  never inspired fear in anyone 
but they knew that when it appeared on her face 
she became and was not to be in her  
 will change it won you said lise and as 
princess mary gave no answer she left the room  
princess mary was left alone she did not comply with 
lise request she not only left her hair as it 
was but did not even look in her glass letting 
her arms fall she sat with eyes and pondered a 
husband a man a strong and attractive being rose in 
her and carried her into a different happy world of 
his own she a child her own as she had 
seen the day before in the arms of her nurse 
daughter her own breast the husband standing by and gazing 
tenderly at her and the child  no it is 
impossible i am too ugly she thought   come 
to tea the prince will be out in a moment 
came the maid voice at the door  she roused 
herself and felt at what she had been thinking and 
before going down she went into the room where the 
and her eyes fixed on the dark face of a 
large of the saviour lit by a she stood before 
it with hands for a few moments a painful doubt 
filled her soul could the joy of love of earthly 
love for a man be for her in her thoughts 
of princess mary of happiness and of children but her 
most deeply was for earthly love the more she tried 
to hide this feeling from others and even from herself 
the it grew  god she said  am i 
to in my heart these of the devil how am 
i to forever these fancies so as to fulfill will 
and scarcely had she put that question than god gave 
her the answer in her own heart  nothing for 
nothing be not anxious or envious man future and own 
fate must remain from thee but live so that be 
ready for anything if it be god will to prove 
thee in the duties of be ready to fulfill his 
will with this consoling thought  yet with a hope 
for the fulfillment of her earthly princess mary and having 
herself went down thinking neither of her gown and nor 
of how she would go in nor of what she 
would say what could all that matter in with the 
will of god without whose care not a hair of 
man head can fall      chapter 
iv   when princess mary came down prince vasili 
and his son were already in the drawing room talking 
to the little princess and mademoiselle when she entered with 
her heavy step on her heels the gentlemen and mademoiselle 
rose and the little princess indicating her to the gentlemen 
said  princess mary saw them all and saw them 
in she saw prince vasili face serious for an instant 
at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and 
the little princess the  produced on the visitors and 
she saw mademoiselle with her ribbon and pretty face and 
her animated look which was fixed on him but him 
she could not see she only saw something large brilliant 
and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room 
prince vasili approached first and she kissed the bold forehead 
that bent over her hand and answered his question by 
saying that on the contrary she remembered him quite well 
then anatole came up to her she still could not 
see him she only felt a soft hand taking hers 
firmly and she touched with her lips a white forehead 
over which was beautiful light hair of when she looked 
up at him she was struck by his beauty anatole 
stood with his right under a of his uniform his 
chest and his back drawn in slightly one foot and 
with his head a little bent looked with beaming face 
at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about 
her at all anatole was not quick nor ready or 
eloquent in conversation but he had the so in society 
of and self if a man in self remains on 
a first and a consciousness of the of such silence 
and an anxiety to find something to say the effect 
is bad but anatole was swung his foot and smilingly 
examined the princess hair it was evident that he could 
be silent in this way for a very long time 
 anyone finds this silence let him talk but i 
don want to he seemed to say besides this in 
his behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly 
in them curiosity and even love consciousness of his own 
superiority it was as if he said to them  
know you i know you but why should i bother 
about you you be only too glad of course perhaps 
he did not really think this when he met women 
probably he did not for in general he thought very 
little his looks and manner gave that the princess felt 
this and as if wishing to show him that she 
did not even expect to interest him she turned to 
his father the conversation was general and animated to princess 
lise voice and little downy lip that lifted over her 
white teeth she met prince vasili with that playful manner 
often employed by lively people and in the that between 
the person they so and themselves there are some long 
and amusing though no such really exist as none in 
this case prince vasili adopted her tone and the little 
princess also drew anatole whom she hardly knew into these 
amusing of things that had never occurred mademoiselle also them 
and even princess mary felt herself made to in these 
merry   at least we shall have the of 
your company all to ourselves dear prince said the little 
princess  course in french to prince vasili  not 
as at annette  receptions where you always ran away 
you remember chere annette       
 anna pavlovna    but you won talk 
politics to me like annette   our little tea 
table   yes   is it you were 
never at annette the little princess asked anatole  i 
know i know she said with a sly glance  
brother hippolyte told me about your on oh and she 
shook her finger at him  have even heard of 
your in paris   didn hippolyte tell you asked 
prince vasili turning to his son and the little princess 
arm as if she would have run away and he 
had just managed to catch her  he tell you 
how he himself was for the dear princess and how 
she showed him the door oh she is a among 
women princess he added turning to princess mary  when 
paris was mentioned mademoiselle for her part seized the opportunity 
of joining in the general current of  she took 
the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole 
had left paris and how he had liked that city 
anatole answered the very and looking at her with a 
smile talked to her about her land when he saw 
the pretty little anatole came to the that he would 
not find bald hills dull either  at all bad 
he thought her  at all bad that little companion 
i hope she will bring her along with her when 
we married la est       
  the little one is charming   the 
old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering 
what he was to do the coming of these visitors 
him  are prince vasili and that son of his 
to me prince vasili is a and his son no 
doubt is a fine he to himself what him was 
that the coming of these visitors in his mind an 
question he always tried to one about which he always 
himself the question was whether he could ever bring himself 
to part from his daughter and give her to a 
husband the prince never asked himself that question knowing that 
he would have to answer it and not only with 
his but with the very of life life without princess 
mary little as he seemed to value her was to 
him  why should she marry he thought  be 
unhappy for certain there lise married to andrew better husband 
one would think could hardly be found is she with 
her lot and who would marry for love plain and 
awkward they take her for her connections and wealth are 
there no women living unmarried and even the happier for 
it so thought prince bolkonski while and yet the question 
he was always putting off demanded an answer prince vasili 
had brought his son with the evident intention of and 
today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer 
his and position in society were not bad  i 
nothing against it the prince said to himself  he 
must be worthy of her and that is what we 
shall see   is what we shall see that 
is what we shall see he added aloud  he 
entered the drawing room with his usual step glancing rapidly 
round the company he noticed the change in the little 
princess dress mademoiselle ribbon princess mary mademoiselle and anatole smiles 
and the of his daughter amid the general conversation  
herself up like a fool he thought looking at her 
 is and he her  he went straight up 
to prince vasili   how d do how d 
do glad to see you   at distance began 
prince vasili in his usual self familiar tone  is 
my second son please love and him  prince bolkonski 
anatole   young fellow fine young fellow he said 
 come and kiss me and he offered his  
anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with 
curiosity and waiting for a display of the his father 
had told him to expect  prince bolkonski sat down 
in his usual place in the corner of the sofa 
and drawing up an armchair for prince vasili pointed to 
it and began him about political affairs and news he 
seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasili said but 
kept glancing at princess mary   so they are 
from already he said repeating prince vasili last words then 
rising he suddenly went up to his daughter   
it for visitors you got yourself up like that eh 
said he  very fine you have done up your 
hair in this new way for the visitors and before 
the visitors i tell you that in future you are 
never to to change your way of dress without my 
consent   was my mon the little princess with 
a blush   must do as you please said 
prince bolkonski to his daughter  she need not make 
a fool of herself she plain enough as it is 
 and he sat down again paying no more attention 
to his daughter who was to tears   the 
contrary that suits the princess very well said prince vasili 
  you young prince what your name said prince 
bolkonski turning to anatole  here let us talk and 
get acquainted   the fun thought anatole sitting down 
with a smile beside the old prince   my 
dear boy i hear you been educated abroad not taught 
to read and write by the like your father and 
me now tell me my dear boy are you serving 
in the horse guards asked the old man scrutinizing anatole 
and   i have been transferred to the line 
said anatole hardly able to restrain his laughter   
that a good thing so my dear boy you wish 
to serve the and the country it is wartime such 
a fine fellow must serve well are you off to 
the front   prince our regiment has gone to 
the front but i am attached what is it i

with a laugh   splendid splendid  am i 
attached to laughed prince bolkonski and anatole laughed still louder 
suddenly prince bolkonski frowned   may go he said 
to anatole  anatole returned smiling to the ladies  
 so you had him educated abroad prince vasili haven 
you said the old prince to prince vasili   
have done my best for him and i can assure 
you the education there is much better than ours  
 everything is different everything is changed the lad a 
fine fellow a fine fellow well come with me now 
he took prince vasili arm and led him to his 
study as soon as they were alone together prince vasili 
announced his and wishes to the old prince   
do you think i shall prevent her that i can 
part from her said the old prince angrily  an 
idea i ready for it tomorrow only let me tell 
you i want to know my son better you know 
my i will ask her tomorrow in your presence if 
she is then he can stay on he can stay 
and i see the old prince  her marry it 
all the same to me he screamed in the same 
piercing tone as when from his son   will 
tell you said prince vasili in the tone of a 
man convinced of the of being with so companion  
know you see right through people anatole is no but 
he is an lad an excellent son or   
right all right we see  as always happens when 
women lead lonely lives for any length of time without 
male society on anatole appearance all the three women of 
prince bolkonski household felt that their life had not been 
real till then their of feeling and immediately and their 
life which seemed to have been passed in was suddenly 
lit up by a new brightness full of  princess 
mary grew quite of her face and the handsome open 
face of the man who might perhaps be her husband 
all her attention he seemed to her kind determined and 
she felt convinced of that thousands of of a future 
family life continually rose in her she drove them away 
and tried to them   am i not too 
cold with him thought the princess  try to be 
because in the of my soul i feel too near 
to him already but then he cannot know what i 
think of him and may imagine that i do not 
like him  and princess mary tried but could not 
manage to be to her new  girl she ugly 
thought anatole  mademoiselle also roused to great excitement by 
anatole arrival thought in another way of course she a 
handsome young woman without any definite position without relations or 
even a country did not to her life to serving 
prince bolkonski to reading aloud to him and being friends 
with princess mary mademoiselle had long been waiting for a 
russian prince who able to appreciate at a glance her 
superiority to the plain badly dressed ungainly russian princesses would 
fall in love with her and carry her off and 
here at last was a russian prince mademoiselle knew a 
story heard from her aunt but finished in her own 
way which she liked to to herself it was the 
story of a girl who had been and to whom 
her poor mother  mere appeared and her for to 
a man without being married mademoiselle was often touched to 
tears as in she told this story to him her 
and now he a real russian prince had appeared he 
would carry her away and then mere would appear and 
he would marry her so her future itself in mademoiselle 
head at the very time she was talking to anatole 
about paris it was not that her  did not 
even for a moment consider what she should do but 
all this had long been familiar to her and now 
that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him 
and she wished and tried to please him as much 
as possible  the little princess like an old war 
horse that the and quite forgetting her condition prepared for 
the familiar of coquetry without any motive or any but 
with naive and gaiety  although in female society anatole 
usually assumed the role of a man tired of being 
run after by women his vanity was flattered by the 
of his power over these three women besides that he 
was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle 
that passionate animal feeling which was to him with great 
and him to the and most reckless actions  after 
tea the company went into the sitting room and princess 
mary was asked to play on the clavichord anatole laughing 
and in high came and leaned on his elbows facing 
her and beside mademoiselle princess mary felt his look with 
a joyous her favorite bore her into a most world 
and the look she felt upon her made that world 
still more but anatole expression though his eyes were fixed 
on her not to her but to the movements of 
mademoiselle little foot which he was then touching with his 
own under the clavichord mademoiselle was also looking at princess 
mary and in her lovely eyes there was a look 
of joy and hope that was also new to the 
princess   she me thought princess mary  happy 
i am now and how happy i may be with 
such a friend and such a husband husband can it 
be possible she thought not daring to look at his 
face but still feeling his eyes gazing at her  
in the evening after supper when all were about to 
retire anatole kissed princess mary hand she did not know 
how she found the courage but she looked straight into 
his handsome face as it came near to her eyes 
turning from princess mary he went up and kissed mademoiselle 
hand  was not but then he did everything so 
simply and with such assurance mademoiselle flushed and gave the 
princess a frightened look   delicacy thought the princess 
 it possible that   i could be of 
her and not value her affection and devotion to me 
she went up to her and kissed her warmly anatole 
went up to kiss the little princess hand   
no no when your father writes to tell me that 
you are behaving well i will give you my hand 
to kiss not till then she said and smilingly raising 
a finger at him she left the room   
   chapter v   they all but 
except anatole who fell as soon as he got into 
bed all kept a long time that night   
he really to be my husband this stranger who is 
so kind kind that is the chief thing thought princess 
mary and fear which she had experienced came upon her 
she feared to look round it seemed to her that 
someone was there standing behind the in the dark corner 
and this someone was he devil he was also this 
man with the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips 
 she rang for her maid and asked her to 
sleep in her room  mademoiselle walked up and down 
the conservatory for a long time that evening expecting someone 
now smiling at someone now herself up to tears with 
the imaginary words of her mere her for her fall 
 the little princess to her maid that her bed 
was badly made she could not lie either on her 
face or on her side every position was awkward and 
uncomfortable and her burden her now more than ever because 
anatole presence had recalled to her the time when she 
was not like that and when everything was light and 
gay she sat in an armchair in her jacket and 
and sleepy and beat and turned the heavy feather bed 
for the third time muttering to herself   told 
you it was all and the little princess repeated  
should be glad enough to fall so it not my 
and her voice quivered like that of a child about 
to cry  the old prince did not sleep either 
half heard him pacing angrily about and the old prince 
felt as though he had been through his daughter the 
was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but 
another his daughter whom he loved more than himself he 
kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter 
and decide what was right and how he should act 
but instead of that he only himself more and more 
  first man that up her father and everything 
else upstairs and does up her hair and wags her 
tail and is unlike herself glad to throw her father 
over and she knew i should notice it and don 
i see that that idiot had eyes only for shall 
have to get rid of her and how is it 
she has not pride enough to see it if she 
has no pride for herself she might at least have 
some for my sake she must be shown that the 
thinks nothing of her and looks only at no she 
has no pride but i let her see  the 
old prince knew that if he told his daughter she 
was making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt 
with mademoiselle princess mary self would be and his point 
 to be from her would be gained so himself 
with this thought he called and began to   
devil brought them here thought he while was putting the 
over his old body and gray chest  never them 
they came to disturb my life there is not much 
of it left   take  he muttered while 
his head was still covered by the shirt  knew 
his habit of sometimes thinking aloud and therefore met with 
looks the angrily expression of the face that from the 
shirt   to bed asked the prince  like 
all good knew the direction of his thoughts he guessed 
that the question to prince vasili and his son  
 have gone to bed and put out their lights 
your excellency   good no good said the prince 
rapidly and his feet into his slippers and his arms 
into the sleeves of his gown he went to the 
on which he  though no words had passed between 
anatole and mademoiselle they quite understood one another as to 
the first part of their up to the appearance of 
the mere they understood that they had much to say 
to one another in private and so they had been 
an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone when 
princess mary went to her father room at the usual 
hour mademoiselle and anatole met in the conservatory  princess 
mary went to the door of the study with special 
it seemed to her that not only did everybody know 
that her fate would be decided that day but that 
they also knew what she thought about it she read 
this in face and in that of prince vasili who 
made her a low bow when she met him in 
the carrying hot water  the old prince was very 
affectionate and in his of his daughter that morning princess 
mary well knew this expression of her father his face 
wore that expression when his dry hands with vexation at 
her not understanding a sum in when rising from his 
chair he would walk away from her repeating in a 
low voice the same words several times over  he 
came to the point at once treating her   
have had a proposition made me you he said with 
an unnatural smile  expect you have guessed that prince 
vasili has not come and brought his with him  
some reason prince bolkonski to anatole as a   
the sake of my beautiful eyes last night a proposition 
was made me on your account and as you know 
my i it to you   am i to 
understand you mon said the princess growing pale and then 
blushing   understand me cried her father angrily  
vasili finds you to his taste as a daughter and 
makes a to you on his behalf that how it 
to be understood  understand it and i ask you 
  do not know what you think father whispered 
the princess   i what of me leave me 
out of the question i not going to get married 
what about you that what i want to know  
the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with 
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that 
her fate would be decided now or never she lowered 
her eyes so as not to see the under which 
she felt that she could not think but would only 
be able to from habit and she said  wish 
only to do your will but if i had to 
express my own desire she had no time to finish 
the old prince interrupted her   he shouted  
will take you with your and take mademoiselle into the 
she be the wife while you  the prince stopped 
he saw the effect these words had produced on his 
daughter she lowered her head and was ready to burst 
into tears   then now then i only he 
said  this princess i hold to the that a 
has a full right to choose i give you freedom 
only remember that your life happiness depends on your decision 
never mind me   i do not know father 
  no need to talk he his orders and 
will marry you or anybody but you are free to 
choose go to your room think it over and come 
back in an hour and tell me in his presence 
yes or no i know you will over it well 
if you like but you had better think it over 
go yes or no yes or no yes or no 
he still shouted when the princess as if lost in 
a had already out of the study  her fate 
was decided and decided but what her father had said 
about mademoiselle was dreadful it was to be sure but 
still it was terrible and she could not help thinking 
of it she was going straight on through the conservatory 
neither seeing nor hearing anything when suddenly the well of 
mademoiselle her she raised her eyes and two steps away 
saw anatole embracing the and something to her with a 
expression on his handsome face anatole looked at princess mary 
but did not at once take his arm from the 
of mademoiselle who had not yet seen her   
that why wait a moment anatole face seemed to say 
princess mary looked at them in silence she could not 
understand it at last mademoiselle gave a and ran away 
anatole bowed to princess mary with a gay smile as 
if inviting her to join in a laugh at this 
strange and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door 
that led to his own apartments  an hour later 
came to call princess mary to the old prince he 
added that prince vasili was also there when came to 
her princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her 
room holding the weeping mademoiselle in her arms and gently 
stroking her hair the princess beautiful eyes with all their 
former calm were looking with tender affection and pity at 
mademoiselle pretty face   princess i have lost your

said and went out  prince vasili with one thrown 
high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand 
was sitting there with a smile of deep on his 
face as if to his heart and himself and laughing 
at his own when princess mary entered he hurriedly took 
a pinch of   my dear my dear he 
began rising and taking her by both hands then sighing 
he added  son fate is in your hands decide

and uttered a cry  prince vasili rose

  chapter vi   it was long since 
the rostovs had news of nicholas not till was the 
count at last a letter addressed in his son on 
receiving it he ran on to his study in alarm 
and trying to escape notice closed the door and began 
to read the letter  anna mikhaylovna who always knew 
everything that passed in the house on hearing of the 
arrival of the letter went softly into the room and 
found the count with it in his hand sobbing and 
laughing at the same time  anna mikhaylovna though her 
circumstances had was still living with the rostovs   
dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry 
prepared to in any way  the count sobbed yet 
more   a letter a my darling boy the 
countess to be an officer thank god how tell the 
little countess  anna mikhaylovna sat down beside him with 
her own handkerchief the tears from his eyes and from 
the letter then having her own eyes she the count 
and decided that at dinner and till she would prepare 
the countess and after tea with god help would inform 
her  at dinner anna mikhaylovna talked the whole time 
about the war news and about twice asked when the 
last letter had been received from him though she knew 
that already and remarked that they might very likely be 
getting a letter from him that day each time that 
these began to make the countess anxious and she glanced 
uneasily at the count and at anna mikhaylovna the latter 
very turned the conversation to insignificant matters natasha who of 
the whole family was the most with a capacity to 
feel any of intonation look and expression up her ears 
from the beginning of the and was certain that there 
was some secret between her father and anna mikhaylovna that 
it had something to do with her brother and that 
anna mikhaylovna was preparing them for it bold as she 
was natasha who knew how her mother was to anything 
to did not to ask any questions at dinner but 
she was too to eat anything and kept about on 
her chair of her governess remarks after dinner she rushed 
head long after anna mikhaylovna and at her herself on 
her neck as soon as she overtook her in the 
sitting room   darling do tell me what it 
is   my dear   sweet one i

a few words told her the of the letter on 
condition that she should tell no one   on 
my true word of honor said natasha crossing herself  
won tell anyone and she ran off at once to 
sonya   a letter she announced in   
was all sonya said instantly turning white  natasha seeing 
the the news of her brother wound produced on sonya 
felt for the first time the side of the news 
 she rushed to sonya hugged her and began to 
cry   little wound but he has been made 
an officer he is well now he wrote himself said 
she through her tears   now it true that

large resolute  i very glad very glad indeed that

haven read the letter asked sonya   but she 
said that it was all over and that he now 
an officer   god said sonya crossing herself  
perhaps she you let us go to mamma  petya 
the room in silence for a time   i 
been in place i would have killed even more of 
those he said  they are i have killed so 
many that there have been a of them   
your tongue petya what a you are   not 
a but they are who cry about trifles said petya 
  you remember him natasha suddenly asked after a 
moment silence  sonya smiled   i remember nicholas 
  sonya but do you remember so that you 
remember him perfectly remember everything said natasha with an gesture 
evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning 
 remember too i remember him well she said  
i don remember boris i don remember him a bit 
  you don remember boris asked sonya in surprise 
  not that i don remember know what he 
is like but not as i remember him just my 
eyes and remember but boris no  her eyes  
there nothing at all   natasha said sonya looking 
and at her friend as if she did not consider 
her worthy to hear what she meant to say and 
as if she were saying it to someone else with 
whom was out of the question  am in love 
with your brother once for all and may happen to 
him or to me shall never to love him as 
long as i live  natasha looked at sonya with 
wondering and eyes and said nothing she felt that sonya 
was speaking the truth that there was such love as 
sonya was speaking of but natasha had not yet felt 
anything like it she believed it could be but did 
not understand it   you write to him she 
asked  sonya became thoughtful the question of how to 
write to nicholas and whether she ought to write tormented 
her now that he was already an officer and a 
hero would it be right to him of herself and 
as it might seem of the to her he had 
taken on himself   don know i think if 
he writes i will write too she said blushing  
 you won feel ashamed to write to him  
sonya smiled     i should be ashamed 
to write to boris i not going to   
should you be ashamed   i don know it 
awkward and would make me ashamed   i know 
why she be ashamed said petya offended by natasha previous 
remark  because she was in love with that fat 
one in spectacles  was how petya described his the 
new count bezukhov  now she in love with that 
singer  meant natasha italian  why she ashamed  
 you a stupid said natasha   more stupid 
than you said the nine petya with the air of 
an old  the countess had been prepared by anna 
mikhaylovna at dinner on to her own room she sat 
in an armchair her eyes fixed on a portrait of 
her son on the of a snuffbox while the tears 
kept coming into her eyes anna mikhaylovna with the letter 
came on to the countess door and paused   
come in she said to the old count who was 
following her  later and she went in the door 
behind her  the count put his to the and 
listened  at first he heard the sound of indifferent 
voices then anna mikhaylovna voice alone in a long speech 
then a cry then silence then both voices together with 
glad and then footsteps anna mikhaylovna opened the door her 
face wore the proud expression of a who has just 
performed a difficult and the public to appreciate his  
 is done she said to the count pointing to 
the countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox 
with its portrait and in the other the letter and 
pressing them to her lips  when she saw the 
count she out her arms to him embraced his bald 
head over which she again looked at the letter and 
the portrait and in order to press them again to 
her lips she slightly pushed away the bald head vera 
natasha sonya and petya now entered the room and the 
reading of the letter began after a description of the 
and the two in which he had taken part and 
his nicholas said that he kissed his father and mother 
hands asking for their and that he kissed vera natasha 
and petya besides that he sent greetings to monsieur madame 
and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for 
him  sonya whom he loved and thought of just 
the same as ever when she heard this sonya blushed 
so that tears came into her eyes and unable to 
bear the looks turned upon her ran away into the 
dancing hall round it at full speed with her dress 
out like a and flushed and smiling down on the 
floor the countess was crying   are you crying 
mamma asked vera  all he says one should be 
glad and not cry  this was quite true but 
the count the countess and natasha looked at her  
who is it she takes after thought the countess  
nicholas letter was read over of times and those who 
were considered worthy to hear it had to come to 
the countess for she did not let it out of 
her hands the tutors came and the and dmitri and 
several and the countess the letter each time with fresh 
pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh of how 
strange how extraordinary how joyful it seemed that her son 
the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had 
felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom 
she used to have with the too count that son 
who had first learned to say  and then  
that this son should now be away in a foreign 
land amid strange a doing some kind of man work 
of his own without help or the experience of showing 
that children do grow from the to did not exist 
for the countess her son toward at each of its 
had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had 
never the millions of human who grew up in the 
same way as twenty years before it seemed impossible that 
the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would 
ever cry her breast and begin to speak so now 
she could not believe that that little creature could be 
this strong man this model son and officer that by 
this letter he now was   a style how 
he said she reading the part of the letter  
what a soul not a word about himself not a 
word about some or other though he himself i say 
is than any of them he says nothing about his 
sufferings what a heart how like him it is and 
how he has remembered everybody not forgetting anyone i always 
said when he was only so high always said  
for more than a week were being made rough of 
to nicholas from all the household were written and copied 
out while under the of the countess and the of 
the count money and all things necessary for the uniform 
and equipment of the newly officer were anna mikhaylovna practical 
woman that she was had even managed by favor with 
army to secure advantageous means of for herself and her 
son she had of sending her to the grand who 
the guards the rostovs that the russian guards abroad was 
quite a definite and that if a letter reached the 
grand in command of the guards there was no reason 
why it should not reach the pavlograd regiment which was 
somewhere in the same neighborhood and so it was decided 
to send the and money by the grand courier to 
boris and boris was to forward them to nicholas the 
were from the old count the countess petya vera natasha 
and sonya and finally there were six thousand rubles for 
his outfit and other things the old count sent to 
his son      chapter vii

preparing to be next day by the two russian and 
the the guards just arrived from russia spent the night 
ten from and next morning were to come straight to 
the reaching the field at by ten o  that 
day nicholas rostov received a letter from boris telling him 
that the regiment was for the night ten from and 
that he wanted to see him as he had a

fellow officer to there drank a bottle of wine and 
then set off alone to the guards to find his 
old rostov had not yet had time to get his 
uniform he had on a cadet jacket decorated with a 
cross cadet breeches with worn and an officer saber with 
a sword the don horse he was was one he 
had from a cossack during the and he wore a 
hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his 
head as he up to the he thought how he 
would boris and all his comrades of the guards by 
his appearance of a hussar who had been under fire 
 the guards had made their whole march as if 
on a pleasure trip their and they had come by 
easy their on and the had excellent for the officers 
at every place the had entered and left the town 
with their playing and by the grand orders the men 
had all the way in step  practice on which 
the guards themselves the officers on foot and at their 
proper boris had been and had all the way with 
berg who was already in command of a company berg 
who had obtained his during the had gained the confidence 
of his by his and and had arranged his money 
matters very boris during the had made the acquaintance of 
many persons who might prove to him and by a 
letter of he had brought from pierre had become acquainted 
with prince andrew bolkonski through whom he to obtain a 
post on the commander in chief staff berg and boris 
having rested after yesterday march were sitting clean and neatly 
dressed at a round table in the clean to them 
playing berg held a smoking pipe between his knees boris 
in the way of him was building a little of 
with his delicate white fingers while awaiting berg move and 
watched his face evidently thinking about the game as he 
always thought only of he was engaged on   
how are you going to get out of that he 
remarked   try to replied berg touching a and 
then his hand  at that moment the door opened 
  he is at last shouted rostov  berg 
too oh you he exclaimed his russian nurse french at 
which he and boris used to laugh long ago  
 me how you have changed  boris rose to 
meet rostov but in doing so did not to steady 
and some that were falling he was about to embrace 
his friend but nicholas him with that peculiar feeling of 
youth that of and wish to express itself in a 
manner different from that of its elders which is often 
nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend 
he wanted to pinch him him do anything but kiss 
him thing everybody did but this boris embraced him in 
a quiet friendly way and kissed him three times  
they had not met for nearly half a year and 
being at the age when young men take their first 
steps on life road each saw immense in the other 
quite a new of the society in which they had 
taken those first steps both had changed greatly since they 
last met and both were in a to show the 
that had taken place in them   you clean 
and fresh as if you been to a fete not 
like us of the line cried rostov with and with 
notes in his voice new to boris pointing to his 
own breeches the german hearing rostov loud voice her head 
in at the door   is she pretty he 
asked with a   do you so you them 
said boris  did not expect you today he added 
 only sent you the note yesterday by bolkonski adjutant 
of kutuzov who a friend of mine i did not 
think he would get it to you so quickly well 
how are you been under fire already asked boris  
without answering rostov shook the cross of st george to 
the of his uniform and indicating a arm glanced at 
berg with a smile   you see he said 
  yes yes said boris with a smile  
we too have had a splendid march you know of 
course that his imperial with our regiment all the time 
so that we had every and every what receptions we 
had in what and balls i can tell you and 
the was very gracious to all our officers  and 
the two friends told each other of their the one 
of his hussar and life in the line the other 
of the and advantages of service under members of the 
imperial family   you guards said rostov  say 
send for some wine  boris made a grimace  
 you really want it said he  he went 
to his bed drew a purse from under the clean 
and sent for wine   and i have some 
money and a letter to give you he added  
rostov took the letter and the money on the sofa 
put both arms on the table and began to read 
after reading a few lines he glanced angrily at berg 
then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the letter 
  they sent you a sum said berg the 
heavy purse that into the sofa  for us count 
we get along on our pay i can tell you 
for myself   say berg my dear fellow said 
rostov  you get a letter from home and meet 
one of your own people whom you want to talk 
everything over with and i happen to be there i 
go at once to be out of your way do 
go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and immediately 
him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face 
evidently wishing to the of his words he added  
be hurt my dear fellow you know i speak from 
my heart as to an old acquaintance   don 
mention it count i quite understand said berg getting up 
and speaking in a and voice   across to 
our they you added boris  berg put on the 
of without a spot or of dust stood before a 
looking glass and brushed the hair on his in the 
way affected by the emperor alexander and having himself from 
the way rostov looked at it that his coat had 
been noticed left the room with a pleasant smile  
 dear what a i am muttered rostov as he 
read the letter     what a i 
am not to have written and to have given them 
such a oh what a i am he repeated flushing 
suddenly  have you sent for some wine all right 
let have some  in the letter from his parents 
was a letter of to which the old countess at 
anna mikhaylovna advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent 
to her son asking him to take it to its 
and make use of it   nonsense much i 
need it said rostov the letter under the table  
 have you thrown that away asked boris   
is some letter of what the devil do i want 
it for    the devil said boris picking 
it up and reading the  letter would be of 
great use to you   want nothing and i 
won be anyone adjutant   not inquired boris  
 a lackey job   are still the same 
i see remarked boris shaking his head   you 
still the same diplomatist but that not the point come 
how are you asked rostov   as you see 
so far everything all right but i confess i should 
much like to be an adjutant and not remain at 
the front     when once a man 
on military service he should try to make as a 
career of it as possible   that it said 
rostov evidently thinking of something else  he looked and 
inquiringly into his friend eyes evidently trying in vain to 
find the answer to some question  old brought in 
the wine   we now send for berg asked 
boris  would drink with you i can   
send for him and how do you get on with 
that german asked rostov with a smile   is 
a very very nice and pleasant fellow answered boris  
again rostov looked into boris eyes and berg returned and 
over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers 
became animated the told rostov of their march and how 
they had been made much of in russia and abroad 
they spoke of the and of their commander the grand 
and told stories of his kindness and berg as usual 
kept silent when the subject did not to himself but 
in connection with the stories of the grand quick he 
related with how in he had managed to deal with 
the grand when the latter made a of the and 
was at the of a movement with a pleasant smile 
berg related how the grand had up to him in 
a shouting   was the favorite expression when he 
was in a and called for the company commander  
 you believe it count i was not at all 
alarmed because i knew i was right without you know 
i may say that i know the army orders by 
heart and know the as well as i do the 
so count there never is any in my company and 
so my conscience was at ease i came forward  
stood up and showed how he himself with his hand 
to his cap and really it would have been difficult 
for a face to express greater respect and self than 
his did  he at me as the saying is 
and and it was not a matter of life but 
rather of death as the saying is  and  
and  said berg with a smile  knew i 
was in the right so i kept silent was not 
that best count  are you he shouted still i 
remained silent and what do you think count the next 
day it was not even mentioned in the orders of 
the day that what keeping one head means that the 
way count said berg his pipe and emitting rings of 
smoke   that was fine said rostov smiling  
but boris noticed that he was preparing to make fun 
of berg and changed the subject he asked him to 
tell them how and where he got his wound this 
pleased rostov and he began talking about it and as 
he went on became more and more animated he told 
them of his affair just as those who have taken 
part in a battle generally do describe it that is 
as they would like it to have been as they 
have heard it described by others and as sounds well 
but not at all as it really was rostov was 
a young man and would on no account have told 
a lie he began his story meaning to tell everything 
just as it happened but and he into if he 
had told the truth to his hearers like himself had 
often heard stories of and had formed a definite idea 
of what an attack was and were expecting to hear 
just such a story would either not have believed him 
or still worse would have thought that rostov was himself 
to since what generally happens to the of cavalry had 
not happened to him he could not tell them simply 
that everyone went at a and that he fell off 
his horse and his arm and then ran as hard 
as he could from a frenchman into the wood besides 
to tell everything as it really happened it would have 
been necessary to make an effort of will to tell 
only what happened it is very difficult to tell the 
truth and young people are capable of it his hearers 
expected a story of how beside himself and all with 
excitement he had like a at the square cut his 
way in right and left how his saber had tasted 
and he had exhausted and so on and so he 
told them all that  in the middle of his 
story just as he was saying  cannot imagine what 
a strange one during an attack prince andrew whom boris 
was expecting entered the room prince andrew who liked to 
help young men was flattered by being asked for his 
and being well disposed toward boris who had managed to 
please him the day before he wished to do what 
the young man wanted having been sent with papers from 
kutuzov to the he looked in on boris to find 
him alone when he came in and saw an hussar 
of the line his military  andrew could not endure 
that sort of man he gave boris a pleasant smile 
frowned as with half eyes he looked at rostov bowed 
slightly and and sat down languidly on the sofa he 
felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company 
rostov flushed up on noticing this but he did not 
care this was a mere stranger glancing however at boris 
he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar 
of the line  in spite of prince andrew disagreeable 
ironical tone in spite of the with which rostov from 
his army point of regarded all these little adjutants on 
the staff of whom the was evidently one rostov felt 
confused blushed and became silent boris inquired what news there 
might be on the staff and what without indiscretion one 
might ask about our   shall probably replied bolkonski 
evidently to say more in the presence of a stranger 
 berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness 
whether as was the of money to of would be 
doubled to this prince andrew answered with a smile that 
he could give no opinion on such an important government 
order and berg laughed gaily   to your business 
prince andrew continued addressing boris  will talk of it 
later  he looked round at rostov  to me 
after the and we will do what is possible  
and having glanced round the room prince andrew turned to 
rostov whose state of childish embarrassment now changing to anger 
he did not to notice and said  think you 
were talking of the affair were you there   
was there said rostov angrily as if intending to the 
aide  bolkonski noticed the hussar state of mind and 
it amused him with a slightly smile he said  
there are many stories now told about that affair  
 stories repeated rostov loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown 
now at boris now at bolkonski  many stories but 
our stories are the stories of men who have been 
under the fire our stories have some weight not like 
the stories of those fellows on the staff who get 
without doing anything   whom you imagine me to 
be one said prince andrew with a quiet and particularly 
amiable smile  a strange feeling of and yet of 
respect for this man self mingled at that moment in 
rostov soul   am not talking about you he 
said  don know you and i don want to 
i am speaking of the staff in general   
i will tell you this prince andrew interrupted in a 
tone of quiet  wish to me and i am 
ready to agree with you that it would be very 
easy to do so if you haven sufficient self but 
admit that the time and place are very badly in 
a day or two we shall all have to take 
part in a greater and more serious and besides who 
says he is an old friend of yours is not 
at all to that my face has the to you 
however he added rising  know my name and where 
to find me but don forget that i do not 
regard either myself or you as having been at all 
and as a man older than you my advice is 
to let the matter drop well then on after the 
i shall expect you au revoir exclaimed prince andrew and 
with a bow to them both he went out  
only when prince andrew was gone did rostov think of 
what he ought to have said and he was still 
more angry at having to say it he ordered his 
horse at once and coldly taking leave of boris home 
should he go to next day and challenge that affected 
adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question 
that him all the way he thought angrily of the 
pleasure he would have at seeing the of that small 
and but proud man when covered by his and then 
he felt with surprise that of all the men he 
knew there was none he would so much like to 
have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he 
so      chapter viii   
the day after rostov had been to see boris a 
was held of the and russian both those arrived from 
russia and those who had been under kutuzov the two 
the russian with his heir the and the with the 
the army of eighty thousand men  from early morning 
the clean were on the move up on the field 
before the now thousands of feet and moved and at 
the officers command turned with flying formed up at and 
round other of infantry in different now was heard the 
beat of and the of cavalry in blue red and 
green with dressed in front on black or gray horses 
then again spreading out with the clatter of the polished 
shining that quivered on the carriages and with the smell 
of came the which between the infantry and cavalry and 
took up its appointed position not only the in full 
with their thin or thick drawn in to the their 
red into their and wearing and all their not only 
the elegant officers but every with his washed and face 
and his clean and polished to the and every horse 
till its coat shone like and every hair of its 
lay that no small matter was but an important and 
solemn affair every general and every was conscious of his 
own aware of being but a drop in that ocean 
of men and yet at the same time was conscious 
of his strength as a part of that enormous whole 
 from early morning and had and by ten o 
all had been brought into order the ranks were drawn 
up on the field the whole army was in three 
lines the cavalry in front behind it the and behind 
that again the infantry  a space like a street 
was left between each two lines of the three of 
that army were distinguished kutuzov army  the on the 
right of the front those recently arrived from russia both 
guards and of the line and the but they all 
stood in the same lines under one command and in 
a like order  like wind over leaves ran an 
whisper  coming they coming alarmed voices were heard and 
a stir of final over all the  from the 
direction of in front of them a group was seen 
approaching and at that moment though the day was still 
a light of wind over the army slightly the on 
the and the against their it looked as if by 
that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy 
at the of the one voice was heard shouting  
front then like the of at this was repeated by 
others from sides and all became silent  in the 
only the of horses was heard this was the the 
up to the and the of the first cavalry regiment 
played the general march it seemed as though not the 
were playing but as if the army itself at the 
had naturally burst into music amid these sounds only the 
youthful kindly voice of the emperor alexander was clearly heard 
he gave the words of greeting and the first regiment 
 so and joyfully that the men themselves were by 
their and the of the power they  rostov standing 
in the front lines of kutuzov army which the approached 
first experienced the same feeling as every other man in 
that army a feeling of self a proud consciousness of 
might and a passionate to him who was the cause 
of this  he felt that at a single word 
from that man all this  he himself an insignificant 
in it would go through fire and water commit die 
or perform of highest and so he could not but 
and his heart stand still at the of that word 
  from all sides one regiment after another greeting 
the with the strains of the march and then  
then the general march and again  growing ever and 
and merging into a  till the reached it each 
regiment in its silence and seemed like a lifeless body 
but as soon as he came up it became its 
joining the of the whole line along which he had 
already passed through the terrible and of those voices amid 
the square of standing as if turned to stone of 
the moved but and above all and in front of 
them two men upon them the passionate attention of that 
whole of men was concentrated  the handsome young emperor 
alexander in the uniform of the horse guards wearing a 
hat with its front and back with his pleasant face 
and though not loud voice everyone attention  rostov was 
not far from the and with his sight had recognized 
the and watched his when he was within twenty and 
nicholas could clearly distinguish every of his handsome happy young 
face he experienced a feeling tenderness and such as he 
had never before known every and every movement of the 
seemed to him enchanting  stopping in front of the 
the said something in french to the emperor and smiled 
 seeing that smile rostov smiled himself and felt a 
still flow of love for his sovereign he to show 
that love in some way and knowing that this was 
impossible was ready to cry the called the colonel of 
the regiment and said a few words to him  
 god what would happen to me if the emperor 
spoke to me thought rostov  should die of happiness 
 the addressed the officers also  thank you all 
gentlemen i thank you with my whole heart to rostov 
every word sounded like a voice from heaven how would 
he have died at once for his   have 
the st george and will be worthy of them  
 to die to die for him thought rostov  
the said something more which rostov did not hear and 
the soldiers their shouted   rostov too bending over 
his shouted  with all his might feeling that he 
would like to himself by that if only to express 
his fully  the stopped a few minutes in front 
of the hussars as if   can the emperor 
be thought rostov but then even this appeared to him 
and enchanting like everything else the did  that only 
an instant the foot in the pointed then fashionable touched 
the of the he his hand in a white gathered 
up the and he moved off accompanied by an swaying 
sea of farther and farther he away stopping at other 
till at last only his white were visible to rostov 
from amid the that the  among the gentlemen of 
the rostov noticed bolkonski sitting his horse and rostov recalled 
their of yesterday and the question itself whether he ought 
or ought not to challenge bolkonski  course not he 
now thought  it worth thinking or speaking of it 
at such a moment at a time of such love 
such and such self what do any of our and 
matter i love and forgive everybody now  when the 
emperor had passed nearly all the the began a march 
past him and rostov on recently from past too at 
the of his is alone and in full of the 
emperor  before he reached him rostov who was a 
splendid twice and put him to the in which the 
animal went when bending his to his chest his tail 
as if also conscious of the emperor eye upon him 
passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful 
as if flying through the air without touching the ground 
 rostov himself his legs well back and his drawn 
in and feeling himself one with his horse past the 
emperor with a frowning but face  a devil as 
expressed it   fellows the remarked the emperor  
 god how happy i should be if he ordered 
me to into the fire this instant thought rostov  
when the was over the newly arrived officers and also 
kutuzov in groups and began to talk about the about 
the and their about their lines about bonaparte and how 
badly the latter would now especially if the corps arrived 
and prussia took our side  but the talk in 
every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander his every 
word and movement was described with  they all had 
but one wish to as soon as possible against the 
under the emperor command by the emperor himself they could 
not to anyone be it whom it might so thought 
rostov and most of the officers after the  all 
were then more confident of than the winning of two 
would have made them      chapter 
ix   the day after the boris in his 
best uniform and with his berg best wishes for success 
to to see bolkonski wishing to by his and obtain 
for himself the best post he could that of adjutant 
to some important a position in the army which seemed 
to him most attractive  is all very well for 
rostov whose father him ten thousand rubles at a time 
to talk about not wishing to to anybody and not 
be anyone lackey but i who have nothing but my 
have to make a career and must not miss but 
must myself of them he reflected  he did not 
find prince andrew in that day but the appearance of 
the town where the and the corps were and the 
two were living with their households and only his desire 
to belong to that higher world  he knew no 
one and despite his guardsman uniform all these passing in 
the in their elegant carriages with their ribbons and both 
and military men seemed so above him an insignificant officer 
of the guards that they not only did not wish 
to but simply could not be aware of his at 
the of the commander in chief kutuzov where he inquired 
for bolkonski all the adjutants and even the looked at 
him as if they wished to on him that a 
great many officers like him were always coming there and 
that everybody was of them in spite of this or 
rather because of it next day  after dinner he 
again went to and entering the house occupied by kutuzov 
asked for bolkonski prince andrew was in and boris was 
shown into a large hall probably used for dancing but 
in which five now stood and of kinds a table 
chairs and a clavichord one adjutant the door was sitting 
at the table in a gown another the red stout 
lay on a bed with his arms under his head 
laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him 
a third was playing a on the clavichord while a 
fourth lying on the clavichord sang the bolkonski was not 
there none of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing 
boris the one who was and whom boris addressed turned 
round crossly and told him bolkonski was on duty and 
that he should go through the door on the left 
into the reception room if he wished to see him 
boris thanked him and went to the reception room where 
he found some ten officers and  when he entered 
prince andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously  that peculiar expression 
of polite weariness which plainly says  it were not 
my duty i would not talk to you for a 
moment was listening to an old russian general with who 
stood very erect almost on with a expression on his 
face something   well then be so good as 
to wait said prince andrew to the general in russian 
speaking with the french intonation he affected when he wished 
to speak contemptuously and noticing boris prince andrew paying no 
more to the general who ran after him him to 
hear something more nodded and turned to him with a 
cheerful smile  at that moment boris clearly realized what 
he had before that in the army besides the and 
in the military which he and the others knew in 
the regiment there was another more important which made this 
general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew for his own 
pleasure chose to with lieutenant more than ever was boris 
to serve in future not to the written but under 
this law he felt now that merely by having been 
recommended to prince andrew he had already above the general 
who at the front had the power to him a 
lieutenant of the guards prince andrew came up to him 
and took his hand   am very sorry you 
did not find me in yesterday i was about with 
all day we went with to the when start being 
there no end to it  boris smiled as if 
he understood what prince andrew was to as something generally 
known but it was the first time he had heard 
name or even the    my dear fellow 
so you still want to be an adjutant i have 
been thinking about you   i was thinking some 
reason boris could not help blushing asking the commander in 
chief he has had a letter from prince kuragin about 
me i only wanted to ask because i fear the 
guards won be in he added as if in  
 right all right we talk it over replied prince 
andrew  let me report this business and i shall 
be at your disposal  while prince andrew went to 
report about the general that not sharing boris of the 
advantages of the of so fixedly at the lieutenant who 
had prevented his finishing what he had to say to 
the adjutant that boris felt uncomfortable he turned away and 
waited for prince andrew return from the commander in chief 
room   see my dear fellow i have been 
thinking about you said prince andrew when they had gone 
into the large room where the clavichord was  no 
use your going to the commander in chief he would 
say a lot of pleasant things ask you to dinner 
 would not be bad as the thought boris  
nothing more would come of it there will soon be 
a of us and adjutants but this is what we 
do i have a good friend an adjutant general and 
an excellent fellow prince and though you may not know 
it the fact is that now kutuzov with his staff 
and all of us count for nothing everything is now 
round the emperor so we will go to i have 
to go there and i have already spoken to him 
about you we shall see whether he cannot you to 
himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the 
sun  prince andrew always became specially when he had 
to a young man and help him to success under 
of help of this kind for another which from pride 
he would never accept for himself he kept in touch 
with the circle which success and which him he very 
took up boris cause and went with him to  
it was late in the evening when they entered the 
at occupied by the and their  that same day 
a of war had been held in which all the 
members of the and both took part at that contrary 
to the views of the old kutuzov and prince it 
had been decided to immediately and give battle to bonaparte 
the of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied 
by boris arrived at the to find everyone at was 
still under the spell of the day at which the 
party of the young had the voices of those who 
delay and waiting for something else before had been so 
completely and their by such of the advantages of that 
what had been discussed at the coming battle and the 
that would certainly result from it longer seemed to be 
in the future but in the past all the advantages 
were on our side our enormous forces superior to napoleon 
were concentrated in one place the inspired by the presence 
were eager for the position where the would take place 
was familiar in all its to the general a had 
that the army should the previous year on the very 
where the french had now to be fought the was 
known and shown in every on the and bonaparte evidently 
was nothing  one of the of an attack had 
just returned from the tired and exhausted but eager and 
proud of the that had been gained prince andrew introduced 
his but prince politely and firmly pressing his hand said 
nothing to boris and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts 
which were in his mind at that moment addressed prince 
andrew in french   my dear fellow what a 
battle we have gained god grant that the one that 
will result from it will be as victorious however dear 
fellow he said and eagerly  must confess to having 
been to the and especially to what what what knowledge 
of the what for every every even to the no 
my dear fellow no better than our present ones could 
have been this of precision with russian more could be 
wished for   the attack is on asked bolkonski 
  do you know my dear fellow it seems 
to me that bonaparte has lost you know that a 
letter was received from him today for the emperor smiled 
significantly   that so and what did he say 
inquired bolkonski   can he say and so on 
merely to gain time i tell you he is in 
our hands that certain but what was most amusing he 
continued with a good laugh  that we could not 
think how to the reply if not as  and 
of course not as  it seemed to me it 
should be to  bonaparte   between not him 
as emperor and calling him general bonaparte there is a 
difference remarked bolkonski   just it interrupted quickly laughing 
 know a very clever fellow he suggested addressing him 
as  and of mankind  laughed merrily   
that said bolkonski   the same it was who 
found a form for the he is a and clever 
fellow   was it   the head of 
the french government au said with grave satisfaction  it 
  but he will it said bolkonski   
yes very much my brother knows him he with him 
present emperor than once in paris and tells me he 
never met a more or subtle diplomatist know a of 
french and italian play do you know the tale about 
him and count count was the only man who knew 
how to handle him you know the story of the 
handkerchief it is delightful  and the turning now to 
boris now to prince andrew told how bonaparte wishing to 
test our ambassador dropped a handkerchief in front of him 
and stood looking at probably expecting to pick it up 
for him and how immediately dropped his own beside it 
and picked it up without touching bonaparte   said 
bolkonski  i have come to you prince as a 
on behalf of this young man you see but before 
prince andrew could finish an aide came in to summon 
to the emperor   what a said getting up 
hurriedly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and boris 
 know i should be very glad to do all 
in my power both for you and for this dear 
young man again he pressed the hand of the latter 
with an expression of good sincere and animated  you 
see another time  boris was by the thought of 
being so close to the higher as he felt himself 
to be at that moment he was conscious that here 
he was in with the that set in motion the 
enormous movements of the of which in his regiment he 
felt himself a tiny and insignificant they followed prince out 
into the and met out of the door of the 
emperor room by which had entered short man in civilian 
clothes with a clever face and which without spoiling his 
face gave him a peculiar and of expression this short 
man nodded to as to an intimate friend and stared 
at prince andrew with cool straight toward him and evidently 
expecting him to bow or to step out of his 
way prince andrew did neither a look of appeared on 
his face and the other turned away and went down 
the side of the   was that asked boris 
  is one of the most but to me 
most unpleasant of men of foreign affairs prince it is 
such men as he who decide the fate of nations 
added bolkonski with a sigh he could not suppress as 
they passed out of the  next day the army 
began its and up to the very battle of boris 
was unable to see either prince andrew or again and 
remained for a while with the regiment    
  chapter x   at dawn on the 
of in which nicholas rostov served and which was in 
prince moved from the place where it had spent the 
night into as arranged and after going behind other for 
about two of a mile was stopped on the rostov 
saw the and then the first and second of hussars 
and infantry and pass by and go forward and then 
and ride past with their adjutants all the fear before 
which he had experienced as all the inner to conquer 
that fear all his of himself as a true hussar 
in this battle had been wasted their remained in reserve 
and nicholas rostov spent that day in a dull and 
wretched mood at nine in the morning he heard in 
front and shouts of and saw being brought back  
were not many of them and at last he saw 
how a whole of french cavalry was brought in by 
a of evidently the affair was over and though not 
big had been a the men and officers returning spoke 
of a brilliant of the occupation of the town of 
and the of a whole french the day was bright 
and after a sharp night and the cheerful of that 
day was in keeping with the news of which was 
not only by the of those who had taken part 
in it but also by the joyful expression on the 
faces of soldiers officers and adjutants as they passed rostov 
going or coming and nicholas who had all the that 
a battle and had spent that happy day in was 
all the more depressed   here let to our 
shouted who had settled down by the with a and 
some food  the officers gathered round and talking  
 they are bringing another cried one of the officers 
indicating a french who was being brought in on foot 
by two  one of them was leading by the 
a fine large french horse he had taken from the 
  us that horse called out to the  
 you like your honor  the officers got up 
and stood round the and their the french was a 
young who spoke french with a german accent he was 
with agitation his face was red and when he heard 
some french spoken he at once began speaking to the 
officers addressing first one then another he said he would 
not have been taken it was not his but the 
who had sent him to seize some though he had 
told him the russians were there and at every word 
he added  don hurt my little horse and stroked 
the animal it was plain that he did not quite 
where he was now he himself for having been taken 
and now himself before his own officers on his and 
in the service he brought with him into our all 
the of of the french army which was so to 
us  the the horse for two gold and rostov 
being the of the officers now that he had received 
his money it   don hurt my little horse 
said the good to rostov when the animal was over 
to the hussar  rostov smilingly the and gave him 
money   said the cossack touching the arm to 
make him go on   emperor the emperor was 
suddenly heard among the hussars  all began to run 
and and rostov saw coming up the road behind him 
several with white in their in a moment everyone was 
in his place waiting  rostov did not know or 
remember how he ran to his place and instantly his 
regret at not having been in and his mood amid 
people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every 
thought of himself had vanished he was filled with happiness 
at his to the emperor he felt that this by 
itself made up to him for the day he had 
lost he was happy as a when the moment of 
meeting not daring to look round and without looking round 
he was conscious of his he felt it not only 
from the sound of the of the approaching but because 
as he drew near everything grew more joyful more significant 
and more around him nearer and nearer to rostov came 
that sun of and light around and already he felt 
himself in those he heard his voice that kindly calm 
and voice that was yet so simple and as if 
in accord with rostov feeling there was a amid which 
was heard the emperor voice   pavlograd hussars he 
inquired   replied a voice a very human one 
to that which had said  pavlograd hussars  the 
emperor drew with rostov and alexander face was even more 
beautiful than it had been three days before at the 
it shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth 
that it suggested the of a fourteen boy and yet 
it was the face of the emperor while surveying the 
the emperor eyes met rostov and rested on them for 
not more than two whether or no the emperor understood 
what was going on in rostov soul  seemed to 
rostov that he understood everything at any rate his light 
eyes gazed for about two into rostov face a gentle 
light from them then all at once he raised his 
eyebrows touched his horse with his left foot and on 
 the younger emperor could not restrain his wish to 
be present at the battle and in spite of the 
of his at twelve o left the third with which 
he had been and toward the before he came up 
with the hussars several adjutants met him with news of 
the result of the  this battle which in the 
of a french was as a brilliant over the french 
and so the emperor and the whole army especially while 
the smoke over the believed that the french had been 
and were against their will a few minutes after the 
emperor had passed the pavlograd was ordered to in itself 
a german town rostov saw the emperor again in the 
place where there had been some rather heavy before the 
emperor arrival lay several killed and soldiers whom there had 
not been time to move the emperor by his of 
officers and was a a different one from that which 
he had at the and bending to one side he 
gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked 
at a who lay with blood on his head the 
was so dirty coarse and that his to the emperor 
rostov rostov saw how the emperor rather round shoulders as 
if a cold shiver had run down them how his 
left foot began convulsively the horse side with the and 
how the well horse looked round and did not stir 
an adjutant lifted the under the arms to place him 
on a that had been brought the   gently 
can you do it more gently said the emperor apparently 
suffering more than the dying and he away  rostov 
saw tears filling the emperor eyes and heard him as 
he was away say to  a terrible thing war 
is what a terrible thing terrible chose la  the 
of the were before within sight of the lines which 
all day long had ground to us at the least 
the emperor gratitude was announced to the were promised and 
the men received a of the and the soldiers even 
more merrily than on the previous night celebrated his to 
the rank of major and rostov who had already drunk 
enough at the end of the the emperor health  
 sovereign the emperor as they say at official said 
he  the health of our sovereign that good enchanting 
and great man let us drink to his health and 
to the certain of the french   we fought 
before he said  letting the french pass as at 
what shall we not do now when he is at 
the front we will all die for him is it 
not so gentlemen perhaps i am not saying it right 
i have drunk a good deal that is how i 
feel and so do you too to the health of 
alexander the first   rang the enthusiastic voices of 
the officers  and the old cavalry captain shouted enthusiastically 
and no less sincerely than the twenty rostov  when 
the officers had and smashed their glasses filled others and 
in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to 
the soldiers and with his long gray mustache his white 
chest showing under his open shirt he stood in a 
in the light of the his arm   here 
to our sovereign the emperor and over our he exclaimed 
in his old hussar  the hussars crowded round and 
with loud shouts  late that night when all had 
with his short hand his favorite rostov on the shoulder 
  there no one to fall in love with 
on he in love with the he said   
don make fun of it cried rostov  is such 
a lofty beautiful feeling such a   believe it 
i believe it and i and   you don 
understand  and rostov got up and went among the 
of what happiness it would be to die in the 
emperor life  did not even to of that but 
simply to die before his eyes he really was in 
love with the and the glory of the russian arms 
and the hope of future and he was not the 
only man to experience that feeling during those days the 
battle of nine of the men in the russian army 
were then in love though less with their and the 
glory of the russian arms      
chapter xi   the next day the emperor stopped 
at and his was to see him at and among 
the near by the news spread that the emperor was 
he ate nothing and had badly that night those around 
him the cause of this was the strong made on 
his mind by the sight of the killed and  
at on the a french officer who had come with 
a flag of truce an audience with the russian emperor 
was brought into from our this officer was the emperor 
had only just and so had to wait at he 
was to the emperor and an hour later he off 
with prince to the post of the french army  
it was that had been sent to to alexander a 
meeting with napoleon to the joy and pride of the 
whole army a interview was refused and instead of the 
sovereign prince the at was sent with to with napoleon 
if contrary to expectations these were by a real desire 
for peace  toward evening came back went straight to 
the and remained alone with him for a long time 
 on the and of the army two days march 
and the after a of in the highest army from 
on the a great bustling began which till the morning 
of the when the battle of was fought  till 
on the the eager talk running to and fro and 
of adjutants to the emperor but on the of that 
day this reached kutuzov and the of the of by 
evening the adjutants had spread it to all and of 
the army and in the night from the to the 
the whole eighty thousand rose from their to the of 
voices and the army swayed and started in one enormous 
six long  the concentrated which had at the emperor 
in the morning and had started the whole movement that 
followed was like the first movement of the main of 
a large clock one slowly moved another was set in 
motion and a third and wheels began to and and 
to work to play to out and the hands to 
with regular motion as a result of all that  
just as in the of a clock so in the 
of the military machine an impulse once given leads to 
the final result and just as indifferently till the moment 
when motion is to them are the of the which 
the impulse has not yet reached wheels creak on their 
as the one another and the with the of their 
movement but a is as quiet and as though it 
were prepared to remain so for a hundred years but 
the moment comes when the it and the impulse that 
to creak and in the common motion the result and 
aim of which are its  just as in a 
clock the result of the motion of wheels and is 
merely a and regular movement of the hands which show 
the time so the result of all the human of 
 russians and french their desires sufferings of pride fear 
and enthusiasm only the of the battle of the so 
battle of the three is to say a movement of 
the hand on the of human history  prince andrew 
was on duty that day and in constant on the 
commander in chief  at six in the evening kutuzov 
went to the emperor and after staying but a short 
time with the went to see the grand of the 
court count  bolkonski took the opportunity to go in 
to get some of the coming from he felt that 
kutuzov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at 
they were dissatisfied with him and also that at the 
emperor everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who 
know something others do not know he therefore wished to 
speak to   how d do my dear fellow 
said who was sitting at tea with  fete is 
for tomorrow how is your old fellow out of sorts 
  won say he is out of sorts but 
i fancy he would like to be heard   
they heard him at the of war and will hear 
him when he sense but to and wait for something 
now when bonaparte nothing so much as a general battle 
is impossible   you have seen him said prince 
andrew  what is bonaparte like how did he you 
  i saw him and am convinced that he 
nothing so much as a general repeated evidently this general 
which he had arrived at from his interview with napoleon 
 he weren afraid of a battle why did he 
ask for that interview why and above all why when 
to is so contrary to his method of war believe 
me he is afraid afraid of a general battle his 
hour has come mark my words   tell me 
what is he like eh said prince andrew again  
 is a man in a gray very anxious that 
i should call him  majesty but who to his 
got no from me that the sort of man he 
is and nothing more replied looking round at with a 
smile   my great respect for old kutuzov he 
continued  should be a nice set of fellows if 
we were to wait about and so give him a 
to escape or to trick us now that we certainly 
have him in our hands no we forget suvorov and 
his rule to put yourself in a position to be 
attacked but yourself to attack believe me in war the 
energy of young men often shows the way better than 
all the experience of old   in what position 
are we going to attack him i have been at 
the today and it is impossible to say where his 
chief forces are said prince andrew  he wished to 
explain to a plan of attack he had himself formed 
  that is all the same said quickly and 
getting up he spread a map on the table  
have been if he is standing before  and prince 
rapidly but explained plan of a movement  prince andrew 
began to reply and to state his own plan which 
might have been as good as but for the that 
had already been as soon as prince andrew began to 
the of the latter and the of his own plan 
prince ceased to listen to him and gazed absent not 
at the map but at prince andrew face   
will be a of war at kutuzov tonight though you 
can say all this there remarked   will do 
so said prince andrew moving away from the map  
 are you about gentlemen said who till then had 
listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now 
was evidently ready with a joke  tomorrow or the 
glory of our russian arms is secure except your kutuzov 
there is not a single russian in command of a 
the are general le de le prince de le prince 
de and finally and so on like all those  
 quiet said  is not true there are now 
two russians and and there would be a third count 
if his were not too weak   i think 
general kutuzov has come out said prince andrew  wish 
you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went 
out after shaking hands with and  on the way 
home prince andrew could not refrain from asking kutuzov who 
was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrow 
battle  kutuzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after 
a pause replied  think the battle will be lost 
and so i told count and asked him to tell 
the emperor what do you think he replied  my 
dear general i am engaged with and look after military 
matters yourself yes that was the answer i got  
    chapter xii   after nine 
o that evening drove with his to kutuzov where the 
of war was to be held all the of were 
to the commander in chief and with the exception of 
prince who declined to come were all there at the 
appointed time  who was in full control of the 
battle by his eagerness and a contrast to the dissatisfied 
and kutuzov who reluctantly played the part of and of 
the of war evidently felt himself to be at the 
head of a movement that had already become he was 
like a horse running to a heavy whether he was 
pulling it or being pushed by it he did not 
know but rushed along at speed with no time to 
consider what this movement might lead to had been twice 
that evening to the line to personally and twice to 
the russian and to report and explain and to his 
where he had the in german and now much exhausted 
he arrived at kutuzov  he was evidently so busy 
that he even forgot to be polite to the commander 
in chief he interrupted him talked rapidly and without looking 
at the man he was addressing and did not reply 
to questions put to him he was with and had 
a weary and air though at the same time he 
was and self  kutuzov was occupying a of modest 
near in the large drawing room which had become the 
commander in chief were gathered kutuzov himself and the members 
of the of war they were drinking tea and only 
prince to begin the at last came with the news 
that the prince could not attend prince andrew came in 
to inform the commander in chief of this and availing 
himself of given him by kutuzov to be present at 
the he remained in the room   prince is 
not coming we may begin said hurriedly rising from his 
seat and going up to the table on which an 
enormous map of the of was spread out  kutuzov 
with his uniform so that his fat neck over his 
collar as if escaping was sitting almost in a low 
chair with his old hands resting on its arms at 
the sound of voice he opened his one eye with 
an effort   yes if you please it is 
already late said he and nodding his head he let 
it and again closed his eye  if at first 
the members of the thought that kutuzov was to sleep 
the sounds his nose during the reading that followed that 
the commander in chief at that moment was by a 
far more serious matter than a desire to show his 
for the or anything else was engaged in the human 
need for sleep he really was with the gesture of 
a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at 
kutuzov and having convinced himself that he was took up 
a paper and in a loud monotonous voice began to 
read out the for the battle under a which he 
also read out   for an attack on the 
position behind and    the were very and 
difficult they began as follows   the left on 
hills and his right along and behind the that are 
there while we on the other hand with our left 
by far his right it is advantageous to attack the 
latter especially if we the of and we can both 
fall on his and him over the plain between and 
the forest the of and which the front for this 
object it is necessary that the first the second the 
third and so on read  the seemed to listen 
reluctantly to the difficult the tall fair general stood his 
back against the wall his eyes fixed on a burning 
and seemed not to listen or even to wish to 
be thought to listen exactly opposite with his wide eyes 
fixed upon him and his mustache sat the in a 
military his elbows turned his hands on his knees and 
his shoulders raised he remained silent gazing at face and 
only turned away his eyes when the chief of staff 
finished reading then looked round significantly at the other but 
one could not tell from that significant look whether he 
agreed or and was satisfied or not with the next 
to sat count who with a subtle smile that never 
left his french face during the whole time of the 
reading gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly by its 
corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait in 
the middle of one of the sentences he stopped the 
motion of the snuffbox raised his head and with politeness 
in the corners of his thin lips interrupted wishing to 
say something but the general continuing to read frowned angrily 
and his elbows as if to say  can tell 
me your views later but now be so good as 
to look at the map and listen lifted his eyes 
with an expression of turned round to as if an 
but meeting the latter but meaningless drooped his eyes sadly 
and again took to his snuffbox   he muttered 
as if to himself but loud enough to be heard 
 with but dignified politeness held his hand to his 
toward with the air of a man in attention a 
little man sat opposite with an and modest and over 
the map studied the and the he asked several times 
to words he had not clearly heard and the difficult 
of and noted them down  when the reading which 
more than an hour was over again brought his snuffbox 
to rest and without looking at or at anyone in 
particular began to say how difficult it was to carry 
out such a plan in which the position was assumed 
to be known it was perhaps not known since the 
was in movement were but it was obvious that their 
chief aim was to show general had read his with 
as much self as if he were addressing school children 
he had to do not with fools but with men 
who could him something in military matters  when the 
monotonous sound of voice ceased kutuzov opened his eye as 
a up when the of the mill is interrupted he 
listened to what said as if  you are still 
at that silly business quickly closed his eye again and 
let his head still lower  trying as as possible 
to vanity as of the military plan that bonaparte might 
easily attack instead of being attacked and so the whole 
of this plan perfectly met all with a firm and 
smile evidently prepared to meet all be they what they 
might   he could attack us he would have 
done so today said he   you think he 
is powerless said   has forty thousand men at 
most replied with the smile of a doctor to whom 
an old wife wishes to explain the of a case 
  that case he is inviting his by awaiting 
our attack said with a ironical smile again glancing round 
for support to who was near him  but was 
at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of 
what the were about   said he  we 
shall see all that on the  again gave that 
smile which seemed to say that to him it was 
strange and to meet from russian and to have to 
prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself 
of but had also convinced the sovereign of   
has his and a continual noise is heard from his 
said he  does that mean either he is which 
is the only thing we need fear or he is 
changing his position  smiled ironically  even if he 
also took up a position in the he merely us 
a great deal of trouble and all our to the 
remain the same   is that began prince andrew 
who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express 
his  kutuzov here up heavily and looked round at 
the   the for tomorrow rather for today for 
it is past now be altered said he  have 
heard them and we shall all do our duty but 
before a battle there is nothing more important he paused 
 to have a good sleep  he moved as 
if to rise the bowed and it was past prince 
andrew went out   the of war at which 
prince andrew had not been able to express his opinion 
as he had to left on him a and uneasy 
whether and or kutuzov and the others who did not 
of the plan of attack were right did not know 
 was it really not possible for kutuzov to state 
his views plainly to the emperor is it possible that 
on account of court and tens of thousands of lives 
and my life my life he thought  be  
 it is very likely that i shall be killed 
tomorrow he thought and suddenly at this thought of death 
a whole of most most intimate rose in his he 
remembered his last from his father and his wife he 
remembered the days when he first loved her he thought 
of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for 
himself and in a nervously and mood he went out 
of the in which he was with and began to 
walk up and down before it  the night was 
and through the the mysteriously  tomorrow tomorrow he thought 
 everything may be over for me all these will 
be no more none of them will have any meaning 
for me tomorrow perhaps even certainly i have a that 
for the first time i shall have to show all 
i can do and his fancy the battle its the 
of at one point and the of all the and 
then that happy moment that for which he had so 
long waited itself to him at last he firmly and 
clearly his opinion to kutuzov to and to the all 
are struck by the of his views but no one 
to carry them out so he takes a regiment a 
that no one is to interfere with his his to 
the point and the alone  death and suffering suggested 
another voice prince andrew however did not answer that voice 
and went on of his the for the next battle 
are by him alone he is only an adjutant on 
kutuzov staff but he does everything alone the next battle 
is won by him alone kutuzov is removed and he 
is appointed  and then asked the other voice  
before that you are not ten times killed or well 
what then  then prince andrew answered himself  don 
know what will happen and don want to know and 
can but if i want this glory want to be 
known to men want to be loved by them it 
is not my that i want it and want nothing 
but that and live only for that yes for that 
alone i shall never tell anyone but oh god what 
am i to do if i love nothing but and 
men death the of family fear nothing and precious and 
dear as many persons are to me sister wife to 
me dreadful and unnatural as it seems i would give 
them all at once for a moment of glory of 
over men of love from men i don know and 
never shall know for the love of these men here 
he thought as he listened to voices in kutuzov courtyard 
the voices were those of the who were up one 
voice probably a was kutuzov old cook whom prince andrew 
knew and who was called he was saying  i 
say   returned the old man   a 
bit said the   go to the devil called 
out a voice drowned by the laughter of the and 
  the same i love and value nothing but 
over them all i value this power and glory that 
is here above me in this     
 chapter xiii   that same night rostov was 
with a on duty in front of his hussars were 
placed along the line in couples and he himself along 
the line trying to the that kept coming over him 
an enormous space with our army in the could be 
seen behind him in front of him was rostov could 
see nothing as he would into that distance now something 
gray now there was something black now little lights seemed 
to where the ought to be now he it was 
only something in his own eyes his eyes kept and 
in his fancy appeared the emperor now and now moscow 
he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before 
him the head and ears of the horse he was 
and sometimes when he came within six of them the 
black of hussars but in the distance was still the 
same  not it might easily happen thought rostov  
the emperor will meet me and give me an order 
as he would to any other officer he say  
and find out what there there are many stories of 
his getting to know an officer in just such a 
way and him to himself what if he gave me 
a place near him oh how i would him how 
i would tell him the truth how i would his 
and in order to his love devotion to the sovereign 
rostov to himself an or a german whom he would 
not only kill with pleasure but whom he would in 
the face before the emperor suddenly a him he started 
and opened his eyes   am i oh yes 
in the line pass and what a that our will 
be in reserve tomorrow he thought  ask leave to 
go to the front this may be my only of 
seeing the emperor it won be long now before i 
am off duty i take another turn and when i 
get back i go to the general and ask him 
he readjusted himself in the and touched up his horse 
to ride once more round his hussars it seemed to 
him that it was getting to the left he saw 
a sloping lit up and facing it a black that 
seemed as as a wall on this there was a 
white patch that rostov could not at all make out 
was it a in the wood lit up by the 
moon or some snow or some white he even thought 
something moved on that white spot  expect it snow 
that spot a spot he thought  now it not 
a natasha sister black eyes  she be surprised when 
i tell her how i seen the emperor natasha take 
my to the right your honor there are here came 
the voice of an hussar past whom rostov was in 
the act of falling rostov lifted his head that had 
almost to his horse and pulled up beside the hussar 
he was to youthful childish  what was i thinking 
i forget how shall i speak to the emperor no 
that not it tomorrow oh yes natasha saber them whom 
the hussars ah the hussars with along the street the 
hussar with i thought about him too just opposite house 
old oh but a fine fellow but that all nonsense 
the chief thing is that the emperor is here how 
he looked at me and wished to say something but 
dared not no it was i who dared not but 
that nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the 
important thing i was thinking of yes oh yes yes 
that right and his head once more to his horse 
neck all at once it seemed to him that he 
was being at  what what cut them down what 
said rostov waking up at the moment he opened his 
eyes he heard in front of him where the was 
the long shouts of thousands of voices his horse and 
the horse of the hussar near him their ears at 
these shouts over there where the shouting came from a 
fire up and went out again then another and all 
along the french line on the hill up and the 
shouting grew louder and louder rostov could hear the sound 
of french words but could not distinguish them the of 
many voices was too great all he could hear was 
 and    that what do you make 
of it said rostov to the hussar beside him  
must be the  the hussar did not reply  
 don you hear it rostov asked again after waiting 
for a reply   can tell your honor replied 
the hussar reluctantly   the direction it must be 
the repeated rostov   may be he or it 
may be nothing muttered the hussar  dark steady he 
cried to his horse  rostov horse was also getting 
it the ground its ears at the noise and looking 
at the lights the shouting grew still louder and into 
a general that only an army of several thousand men 
could produce the lights spread farther and farther probably along 
the line of the french rostov no longer wanted to 
sleep the gay shouting of the army had a stimulating 
effect on him  l l he now heard distinctly 
  can be far off probably just the stream 
he said to the hussar beside him  the hussar 
only without and angrily the sound of horse approaching at 
a along the line of hussars was heard and out 
of the the figure of a of hussars suddenly appeared 
huge as an   honor the said the up 
to rostov  rostov still looking round toward the and 
the shouts with the to meet some men who were 
along the line one was on a white horse prince 
and prince with their adjutants had come to witness the 
of the lights and shouts in the rostov up to 
to him and then joined the adjutants listening to what 
the were saying   me said prince addressing  
is nothing but a trick he has and ordered the 
to and make a noise to us   said 
 saw them this evening on that if they had 
they would have from that too officer said to rostov 
 the still there   were there this evening 
but now i don know your excellency shall i go 
with some of my hussars to see replied rostov  
stopped and before tried to see rostov face in the 
  go and see he said after a pause 
  sir  rostov his horse called to and 
two other hussars told them to follow him and in 
the direction from which the shouting came he felt both 
frightened and pleased to be alone with three hussars into 
that and dangerous distance where no one had been before 
him called to him from the hill not to go 
the stream but rostov pretended not to hear him and 
did not stop but on and on continually for and 
for men and continually his having the hill at a 
he no longer saw either our own or the but 
heard the shouting of the french more loudly and distinctly 
in the valley he saw before him something like a 
river but when he reached it he found it was 
a road having come out onto the road he in 
his horse whether to ride along it or cross it 
and ride over the black field up the to keep 
to the road which white in the would have been 
because it would be to see people coming along it 
 me said he the road and began up the 
hill at a toward the point where the french had 
been standing that evening   honor there he is 
cried one of the hussars behind him and before rostov 
had time to make out what the black thing was 
that had suddenly appeared in the there was a followed 
by a report and a high up in the with 
a sound passed out of hearing another fire but flashed 
in the rostov turned his horse and back four more 
reports followed at and the passed somewhere in the in 
different tones rostov in his horse whose had like his 
own at the and went back at a  some 
more some more a merry voice was saying in his 
soul but no more came  only when approaching did 
rostov let his horse again and with his hand at 
the up to the general  was still insisting that 
the french had and had only lit to us  
 does that prove he was saying as rostov up 
 might and leave the   plain that they 
have not all gone yet prince said  till tomorrow 
morning we find out everything tomorrow   is still 
on the hill your excellency just where it was in 
the evening rostov forward with his hand at the and 
unable to the smile of by his ride and especially 
by the sound of the   good very good 
said  you officer   excellency said rostov  
i ask a favor   is it   
our is to be in reserve may i ask to 
be attached to the first   your name  
 rostov   very well you may stay in 
on me   ilya rostov son asked  but 
rostov did not reply   i may reckon on 
it your excellency   will give the order  
 very likely i may be sent with some to 
the emperor thought rostov   god   the 
and shouting in the army were by the fact that 
while napoleon was being read to the the emperor himself 
round his the soldiers on seeing him lit of straw 
and ran after him shouting  l napoleon was as 
follows   soldiers the russian army is against you 
to avenge the army of they are the same you 
broke at and have ever since to this place the 
position we is a strong one and while they are 
to go round me on the right they will a 
to me soldiers i will myself direct your i will 
keep out of fire if you with your habitual carry 
and into the ranks but should be in doubt even 
for a moment you will see your emperor himself to 
the first of the for there must be no doubt 
of especially on this day when what is at stake 
is the honor of the french infantry so necessary to 
the honor of our nation  do not break your 
ranks on the of the let every man be fully 
with the thought that we must these of england inspired 
by such hatred of our nation this will our and 
we can return to winter where fresh french who are 
being raised in france will join us and the peace 
i shall will be worthy of my people of you 
and of myself  napoleon      
chapter xiv   at five in the morning it 
was still quite dark the of the center the and 
right had not yet moved but on the left the 
of infantry cavalry and which were to be the first 
to the to attack the french right and drive it 
into the to plan were already up and the smoke 
of the into which they were everything made the eyes 
it was cold and dark the officers were hurriedly drinking 
tea and the soldiers and a with their feet to 
warm themselves gathering round the into the the remains of 
chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they did not 
want or could not carry away with them were moving 
in and out among the russian and served as of 
the as soon as an officer showed himself near a 
officer the regiment began to move the soldiers ran from 
the thrust their pipes into their their into the got 
their ready and formed rank the officers buttoned up their 
on their and and moved along the ranks shouting the 
train and and the and tied on the the adjutants 
and and themselves gave final orders and to the men 
who remained behind and the monotonous of thousands of feet 
the moved forward without knowing where and unable from the 
around them the smoke and the to see either the 
place they were leaving or that to which they were 
going  a on the march is in and along 
by his regiment as much as a is by his 
ship however far he has walked strange and dangerous places 
he just as a is always by the same and 
of his ship so the always has around him the 
same comrades the same ranks the same major the same 
company dog and the same the cares to know the 
in which his ship is sailing but on the day 
of battle knows how and stern note of which all 
are conscious sounds in the of an army the of 
something and solemn and in the men an curiosity on 
the day of battle the soldiers try to get the 
interests of their regiment they listen look about and eagerly 
ask what is going on around them  the had 
grown so that though it was growing light they could 
not see ten looked like gigantic and ground like and 
anywhere on any side one might an invisible ten off 
but the for a long time always in the same 
and hills and going over new and ground and nowhere 
the on the contrary the soldiers became aware that in 
front behind and on all sides other russian were moving 
in the same direction every felt glad to know that 
to the place where he was going many more of 
our men were going too   now the have 
also gone past was being said in the ranks  
 wonderful what a lot of our have gathered last 
night i looked at the and there was no end 
of them a regular moscow  though none of the 
up to the ranks or talked to the men  
as we saw at the of war were out of 
and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not themselves 
to the men but merely carried out the orders yet 
the gaily as they always do when going into especially 
to an attack but when they had for about an 
hour in the the greater part of the men had 
to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some and spread 
through the ranks how such a consciousness is is very 
difficult to but it certainly is very and rapidly and 
as water does in a had the russian army been 
alone without any it might perhaps have been a long 
time before this consciousness of became a general conviction but 
as it was the was and naturally to the stupid 
and everyone was convinced that a dangerous had been by 
the   have we stopped is the way or 
have we already come up against the french   
one can hear them they be if we had  
 were in a enough to start us and now 
here we stand in the middle of a field without 
or reason it all those what stupid   i 
send them on in front but no fear they crowding 
up behind and now here we stand   say 
shall we soon be clear they say the cavalry are 
blocking the way said an officer   those they 
don know their own country said another   are 
you shouted an adjutant up     why 
are you here you should have gone on long ago 
now you won get there till evening   stupid 
orders they don themselves know what they are doing said 
the officer and off  then a general past shouting 
something angrily not in russian   but what he 
no one can make out said a the general who 
had away  them the   were ordered to 
be at the place before nine but we haven got 
halfway fine orders was being repeated on different sides  
and the feeling of energy with which the had started 
began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid 
and at the  the cause of the was that 
while the cavalry was moving toward our left the higher 
command found that our center was too far from our 
right and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back 
to the right several thousand cavalry in front of the 
infantry who had to wait  at the front an 
occurred between an and a russian general the general shouted 
a demand that the cavalry should be the that not 
he but the higher command was to the meanwhile stood 
growing listless and dispirited after an hour delay they at 
last moved on the hill the that was on the 
hill lay still more below where they were in front 
in the a was heard and then another at first 
at then more and more and rapidly and the at 
the stream began  not expecting to come on the 
down by the stream and having on him in the 
hearing no word from their and with a consciousness of 
being too late spreading through the ranks and above all 
being unable to see anything in front or around them 
in the thick the russians exchanged with the and and 
again receiving no orders from the officers or adjutants who 
about in the in those unable to find their own 
in this way the began for the first second and 
third which had gone down into the valley the fourth 
with which kutuzov was stood on the  below where 
the fight was beginning there was still thick on the 
higher ground it was but nothing could be seen of 
what was going on in front whether all the forces 
were as we six away or whether they were near 
by in that sea of no one knew till after 
eight o  it was nine o in the morning 
the lay like a sea down below but higher up 
at the village of where napoleon stood with his around 
him it was quite light above him was a clear 
blue sky and the sun quivered like a huge hollow 
crimson on the surface of that sea of the whole 
french army and even napoleon himself with his staff were 
not on the far side of the and of and 
which we intended to take up our position and begin 
the but were on this side so close to our 
own forces that napoleon with the eye could distinguish a 
man from one on foot napoleon in the blue cloak 
which he had worn on his italian sat on his 
small gray horse a little in front of his he 
gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out 
of the sea of and on which the russian were 
moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds 
of in the valley not a single muscle of his 
face in those days was still thin his eyes were 
fixed on one spot his were being justified part of 
the russian force had already into the valley toward the 
and and part were leaving these which he intended to 
attack and regarded as the key to the position he 
saw over the that in a hollow between two hills 
near the village of the russian their were moving in 
one direction toward the valley and one after another into 
the from information he had received the evening before from 
the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the during 
the night by the movement of the russian and from 
all he saw clearly that the believed him to be 
far away in front of them and that the moving 
near the center of the russian army and that that 
center was already to be attacked but still he did 
not begin the  today was a great day for 
him of his coronation before dawn he had for a 
few hours and vigorous and in good he his horse 
and out into the field in that happy mood in 
which everything seems possible and everything he sat looking at 
the visible above the and his cold face wore that 
special look of confident self happiness that one on the 
face of a boy in love the stood behind him 
not to his attention he looked now at the now 
at the sun up out of the  when the 
sun had entirely from the and and were with light 
if he had only this to begin the drew the 
from his shapely white hand made a sign with it 
to the and ordered the to begin the accompanied by 
adjutants off in different directions and a few minutes later 
the chief forces of the french army moved rapidly toward 
those which were being more and more by russian moving 
down the valley to their left     
 chapter xv   at eight o kutuzov to 
at the head of the fourth the one that was 
to take the place of and which had already gone 
down into the valley he greeted the men of the 
regiment and gave them the order to march indicating that 
he intended to lead that himself when he had reached 
the village of he prince andrew was behind among the 
immense number the commander in chief he was in a 
state of suppressed excitement and irritation though calm as a 
man is at the of a long moment he was 
firmly convinced that this was the day of his or 
his bridge of arcola how it would come about he 
did not know but he felt sure it would do 
so the and the position of our were known to 
him as far as they could be known to anyone 
in our army his own plan which obviously could not 
now be carried out was forgotten now entering into plan 
prince andrew considered possible and formed new such as might 
call for his of perception and decision  to the 
left down below in the the fire of unseen forces 
could be heard it was there prince andrew thought the 
fight would  we shall difficulties and there thought he 
 shall be sent with a or and there in 
hand i shall go forward and break is in front 
of me  he could not look at the of 
the passing seeing them he kept thinking  may be 
the very with which i shall lead the army  
in the morning all that was left of the night 
on the was a now turning to but in the 
it still lay like a milk sea nothing was visible 
in the valley to the left into which our had 
and from came the sounds of above the was the 
dark clear sky and to the right the of the 
sun in front far off on the farther of that 
sea of some hills were and it was there the 
probably was for something could be on the right the 
guards were entering the region with a sound of and 
wheels and now and then a gleam of to the 
left the village of cavalry came up and in the 
sea of in front and behind moved infantry the commander 
in chief was standing at the end of the village 
letting the pass by him that morning kutuzov seemed worn 
and the infantry passing before him came to a halt 
without any command being given apparently by something in front 
  order them to form into and go round 
the village he said angrily to a general who had 
up  you understand your excellency my dear sir that 
you must not through village when we are against the 
  intended to them the village your excellency answered 
the general  kutuzov laughed bitterly   make a 
fine thing of it in sight of the very fine 
  is still far away your excellency to the 
  exclaimed kutuzov bitterly  told you that kindly 
do as you are ordered   sir   
dear fellow whispered to prince andrew  old man is 
as as a dog  an officer in a white 
uniform with green in his hat up to kutuzov and 
asked in the emperor name had the fourth into  
kutuzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to 
fall upon prince andrew who was beside him seeing him 
kutuzov and caustic expression as if admitting that what was 
being done was not his adjutant and still not answering 
the adjutant he addressed bolkonski   my dear fellow 
and see whether the third has passed the village tell 
it to stop and my orders  hardly had prince 
andrew started than he stopped him   ask whether 
have been he added  are they doing what are 
they doing he murmured to himself still not to the 
 prince andrew off to the order  the that 
continued to he stopped the third and convinced himself that 
there really were no in front of our the colonel 
at the head of the regiment was much surprised at 
the commander in chief order to throw out he had 
felt perfectly sure that there were other in front of 
him and that the must be at least six away 
there was really nothing to be seen in front except 
a by having given orders in the commander in chief 
name to this prince andrew back kutuzov still in the 
same place his stout body resting heavily in the with 
the of age sat with closed eyes the were no 
longer moving but stood with the of their on the 
ground   right all right he said to prince 
andrew and turned to a general who watch in hand 
was saying it was time they started as all the 
left had already   of time your excellency muttered 
kutuzov in the midst of a  of time he 
repeated  just then at a distance behind kutuzov was 
heard the sound of and this sound rapidly came nearer 
along the whole line of the russian evidently the person 
they were greeting was quickly when the soldiers of the 
regiment in front of which kutuzov was standing began to 
he a little to one side and looked round with 
a frown along the road from what looked like a 
of in two of them side by side in front 
at full one in a black uniform with white in 
his hat a horse the other who was in a 
white uniform a black one these were the two followed 
by their kutuzov the manners of an old at the 
front gave the command  and up to the with 
a his whole appearance and manner were suddenly he put 
on the air of a who without with an affectation 
of respect which evidently struck alexander he up and  
this unpleasant merely over the young and happy face of 
the emperor like a cloud of across a clear sky 
and vanished after his illness he looked rather that day 
than on the field of where bolkonski had seen him 
for the first time abroad but there was still the 
same of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes 
and on his delicate lips the same capacity for expression 
and the same appearance of innocent youth  at the 
he had seemed more here he seemed and more he 
was slightly flushed after two and in his horse he 
and looked round at the faces of his young and 
animated as his own novosiltsev prince and the others all 
dressed gay young men on splendid well fresh only slightly 
horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the emperor 
the emperor a rosy long young man sat very erect 
on his handsome black horse looking about him in a 
leisurely and manner he to one of his white adjutants 
and asked some question likely he is asking at what 
o they started thought prince andrew watching his old acquaintance 
with a smile he could not as he recalled his 
reception at in the were the picked young officers of 
the and line russian and among them were leading the 
beautiful horses covered with embroidered  as when a window 
is opened a of fresh air from the a room 
so a of energy and confidence of success reached kutuzov 
staff with the of all these brilliant young men  
 you beginning michael ilarionovich said the emperor alexander hurriedly 
to kutuzov glancing courteously at the same time at the 
emperor   am waiting your majesty answered kutuzov bending 
forward respectfully  the emperor frowning slightly bent his forward 
as if he had not quite heard   your 
majesty repeated kutuzov  andrew noted that kutuzov upper lip 
unnaturally as he said the word   all the 
have formed up yet your majesty  the heard but 
obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his rather 
round shoulders and glanced at novosiltsev who was near him 
as if of kutuzov   know michael ilarionovich we 
are not on the empress field where a does not 
begin till all the are assembled said the with another 
glance at the emperor as if inviting him if not 
to join in at least to listen to what he 
was saying but the emperor continued to look about him 
and did not listen   is just why i 
do not begin said kutuzov in a voice apparently to 
the of not being heard and again something in his 
face is just why i do not begin because we 
are not on and not on the empress field said 
clearly and distinctly  in the emperor all exchanged looks 
that expressed and reproach  though he may be he 
should not he certainly should not speak like that their 
glances seemed to say  the looked and into kutuzov 
eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more 
but kutuzov with respectfully bowed head seemed also to be 
waiting the silence for about a minute   if 
you command it your majesty said kutuzov lifting his head 
and again assuming his former tone of a dull but 
general  he touched his horse and having called the 
commander of the gave him the order to  the 
again began to move and two of the and one 
of the regiment went forward past the emperor  as 
this by the red without his with his orders on 
his breast and an enormous of in his hat worn 
on one side with its corners front and back forward 
and with a in his horse before the emperor  
 be with you general said the emperor   
nous qui  he answered gaily raising nevertheless smiles among 
the gentlemen of the by his poor french   
       we shall do 
everything it is possible to      
do   his horse and himself a little behind 
the emperor the men by the presence passed in step 
before the and their at a bold   shouted 
in a loud self and voice obviously so by the 
sound of by the prospect of battle and by the 
sight of the his comrades in suvorov time now passing 
so before the that he forgot the sovereigns presence  
it not the first village you had to take cried 
he   to do our best shouted the soldiers 
 the emperor horse started at the cry this horse 
that had carried the sovereign at in russia bore him 
also here on the field of the of his left 
foot and its ears at the sound of just as 
it had done on the empress field not understanding the 
of the nor of the of the emperor black nor 
of all that was being said thought and felt that 
day by its  the emperor turned with a smile 
to one of his and made a remark to him 
pointing to the      chapter xvi 
  kutuzov accompanied by his adjutants at a behind 
the  when he had gone less than half a 
mile in the of the he stopped at a deserted 
house that had probably once been an where two both 
of them led and were along both  the had 
to clear and were already visible about a mile and 
a half off on the opposite down below on the 
left the became more distinct kutuzov had stopped and was 
speaking to an general prince andrew who was a little 
behind looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask 
him for a field glass   look said this 
adjutant looking not at the in the distance but down 
the hill before him  the french  the two 
and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying 
to it from one another the expression on all their 
faces suddenly changed to one of horror the french were 
to be a mile and a half away but had 
suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us  
 the no yes see it is for certain but 
how is that said different voices  with the eye 
prince andrew saw below them to the right not more 
than five hundred from where kutuzov was standing a french 
coming up to meet the   it is the 
moment has arrived my turn has come thought prince andrew 
and striking his horse he up to kutuzov   
must be stopped your excellency cried he but at that 
very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round was 
heard quite close at hand and a voice of naive 
two steps from prince andrew shouted  all lost and 
at this as if at a command everyone began to 
run  confused and ever were running back to where 
five minutes before the had passed the not only would 
it have been difficult to stop that crowd it was 
even impossible not to be carried back with it bolkonski 
only tried not to lose touch with it and looked 
around and unable to what was in front of him 
with an angry face red and unlike himself was shouting 
to kutuzov that if he did not ride away at 
once he would certainly be taken kutuzov remained in the 
same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief blood 
was from his prince andrew forced his way to him 
  are he asked hardly able to the of 
his lower   wound is not here it is 
there said kutuzov pressing the handkerchief to his and pointing 
to the soldiers  them he shouted and at the 
same moment probably that it was impossible to stop them 
his horse and to the right  a fresh of 
the flying caught him and bore him back with it 
 the were running in such a that once by 
them it was difficult to get out again one was 
shouting  on why are you us another in the 
same place turned round and in the air a third 
was striking the horse kutuzov himself having by a great 
effort got away to the left from that of men 
kutuzov with his by more than half toward a sound 
of fire near by having forced his way out of 
the crowd of prince andrew trying to keep near kutuzov 
saw on the of the hill amid the smoke a 
russian that was still and running toward it higher up 
stood some russian infantry neither moving forward to the nor 
backward with the crowd a general himself from the infantry 
and approached kutuzov of kutuzov only four remained they were 
all pale and exchanged looks in silence   those 
kutuzov to the commander pointing to the flying soldiers but 
at that instant as if to him for those words 
across the regiment and across kutuzov like a flock of 
little birds  the french had attacked the and seeing 
kutuzov were at him after this the commander clutched at 
his several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was 
holding the flag let it fall from his hands it 
swayed and fell but caught on the of the soldiers 
the soldiers started without orders   oh oh kutuzov 
and looked around  he whispered his voice from a 
consciousness of the of age  he whispered pointing to 
the and at the  that  but before he 
had finished speaking prince andrew feeling tears of shame and 
anger him had already from his horse and run to 
the   he shouted in a voice piercing as 
a child   it is thought he the staff 
of the and hearing with pleasure the of evidently at 
him several soldiers fell   shouted prince andrew and 
scarcely able to hold up the heavy he ran forward 
with full confidence that the whole would follow him  
and really he only ran a few steps alone one 
moved and then another and soon the whole ran forward 
shouting  and overtook him a of the ran up 
and took the flag that was swaying from its weight 
in prince andrew hands but he was immediately killed prince 
andrew again seized the and it by the staff ran 
on with the in front he saw our some of 
whom were while others having their were running toward him 
he also saw french infantry soldiers who were the horses 
and turning the round prince andrew and the were already 
within twenty of the he heard the of above him 
and to right and left of him soldiers continually and 
dropped but he did not look at them he looked 
only at what was going on in front of him 
the he now saw clearly the figure of a red 
with his pulling one end of a while a french 
tugged at the other he could distinctly see the yet 
angry expression on the faces of these two men who 
evidently did not what they were doing   are 
they about thought prince andrew as he gazed at them 
 doesn the red run away as he is why 
doesn the frenchman him he will not get away before 
the frenchman his and him  and really another french 
his ran up to the men and the fate of 
the red who had the and still did not what 
him was about to be decided but prince andrew did 
not see how it ended it seemed to him as 
though one of the soldiers near him hit him on 
the head with the full swing of a it hurt 
a little but the of it was that the him 
and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at 
  this am i falling my legs are giving 
way thought he and fell on his back he opened 
his eyes to see how the of the with the 
ended whether the red had been killed or not and 
whether the had been captured or but he saw nothing 
above him there was now nothing but the sky lofty 
sky not clear yet still lofty with gray slowly across 
it  quiet and solemn not at all as i 
ran thought prince andrew as we ran shouting and not 
at all as the and the frenchman with frightened and 
angry faces for the how differently do those across that 
lofty sky how was it i did not see that 
lofty sky before and how happy i am to have 
found it at last yes all is vanity all except 
that sky there is nothing nothing but that but even 
it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and 
peace thank god      chapter xvii 
  on our right by at nine o the 
battle had not yet not wishing to agree to demand 
to the and wishing to responsibility from himself prince to 
to send to of the commander in chief knew that 
as the distance between the two was more than six 
even if the were not killed  he very likely 
would be and found the commander in chief  would 
be very difficult he would not be able to get 
back before evening  his large sleepy eyes round his 
and the face rostov with excitement and hope was the 
first to catch his eye he sent him   
if i should meet his majesty before i meet the 
commander in chief your excellency said rostov with his hand 
to his cap   can give the to his 
majesty said hurriedly interrupting  on being relieved from duty 
rostov had managed to get a few hours sleep before 
morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with of movement 
faith in his good fortune and generally in that state 
of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy 
 all his wishes were being that morning there was 
to be a general in which he was taking part 
more than that he was to the general and still 
more he was going with a to kutuzov perhaps even 
to the sovereign himself the morning was bright he had 
a good horse under him and his heart was full 
of joy and happiness on receiving the order he gave 
his horse the and along the line at first he 
along the line of which had not yet into but 
were standing then he came to the region occupied by 
cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of 
for battle having passed cavalry he clearly heard the sound 
of and of him the grew louder and louder  
in the fresh morning air were now heard not two 
or three at as before followed by one or two 
but a of of from the of the hill before 
interrupted by such reports of that sometimes several of them 
were not from one another but into a general  
he could see of smoke that seemed to one another 
down the and of smoke rolling spreading and mingling with 
one another he could also by the gleam of visible 
through the smoke make out moving of infantry and lines 
of with green  rostov stopped his horse for a 
moment on a to see what was going on but 
strain his attention as he would he could not understand 
or make out anything of what was there in the 
smoke men of some sort were moving about in front 
and behind moved lines of but why and who they 
were it was impossible to make out these and sounds 
had no or effect on him on the contrary they 
his energy and   on go on give it 
them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and again to 
along the line farther and farther into the region where 
the army was already in   it will be 
there i don know but all will be well thought 
rostov  after passing some he noticed that the next 
part of the line  guards was already in  
 much the better i shall see it close he 
thought  he was almost along the front line a 
of men came toward him they were our who with 
ranks were returning from the attack rostov got out of 
their way noticed that one of them was and on 
  is no business of mine he thought he 
had not many hundred after that before he saw to 
his left across the whole of the field an enormous 
of cavalry in brilliant white on black horses straight toward 
him and across his path rostov put his horse to 
full to get out of the way of these men 
and he would have got clear had they continued at 
the same speed but they kept their so that some 
of the horses were already rostov heard the of their 
and the of their and saw their horses their and 
even their faces more and more distinctly they were our 
horse guards to attack the french cavalry that was coming 
to meet them  the horse guards were but still 
holding in their horses rostov could already see their faces 
and heard the command  shouted by an officer who 
was his to full speed rostov fearing to be or 
into the attack on the french along the front as 
hard as his horse could go but still was not 
in time to avoid them  the last of the 
horse guards a huge fellow frowned angrily on seeing rostov 
before him with whom he would this guardsman would certainly 
have rostov and his over  felt himself quite tiny 
and weak to these gigantic men and horses had it 
not occurred to rostov to his before the eyes of 
the guardsman horse the heavy black horse sixteen hands high 
back its ears but the guardsman drove his huge spurs 
in and the horse its tail and its neck on 
yet hardly had the horse guards passed rostov before he 
heard them  and looking back saw that their ranks 
were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red probably 
french he could see nothing more for immediately afterwards began 
from somewhere and smoke everything  at that moment as 
the horse guards having passed him in the smoke rostov 
whether to after them or to go where he was 
sent this was the brilliant of the horse guards that 
the french themselves rostov was to hear later that of 
all that of huge and handsome men of all those 
brilliant rich officers and who had past him on their 
thousand horses only were left after the   should 
i them my is not lost and maybe i shall 
see the emperor immediately thought rostov and on  when 
he came with the foot guards he noticed that about 
them and around them balls were flying of which he 
was aware not so much because he heard their sound 
as because he saw on the soldiers faces and unnatural 
solemnity on those of the officers  passing behind one 
of the lines of a regiment of foot guards he 
heard a voice calling him by name    
 he answered not boris   say we been 
in the front line our regiment attacked said boris with 
the happy smile seen on the faces of young men 
who have been under fire for the first time  
rostov stopped   you he said  how did 
it go   drove them back said boris with 
animation growing  you imagine it and he began how 
the guards having taken up their position and seeing before 
them thought they were and all at once discovered from 
the balls by those that they were themselves in the 
front line and had unexpectedly to go into rostov without 
hearing boris to the end his horse   are 
you off to asked boris   a to his 
majesty   he is said boris thinking rostov had 
said  and pointing to the grand who with his 
high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred away from 
them in his and horse guards jacket shouting something to 
a pale white officer   that the grand and 
i want the commander in chief or the emperor said 
rostov and was about to his horse   count 
shouted berg who ran up from the other side as 
eager as boris  i am in my right hand 
 he showed his hand with a handkerchief tied round 
it  i remained at the front i held my 
sword in my left hand count all our family been 
 he said something more but rostov did not wait 
to hear it and away  having passed the guards 
and an empty space rostov to avoid again getting in 
front of the first line as he had done when 
the horse guards followed the line of going far round 
the place where the fire and were heard suddenly he 
heard fire quite close in front of him and behind 
our where he could never have expected the to be 
  can it be he thought  in the 
of our army impossible and suddenly he was seized by 
a of fear for himself and for the of the 
whole battle  be that what it may he reflected 
 is no round it now i must look for 
the commander in chief here and if all is lost 
it is for me to with the rest  the 
of that had suddenly come over rostov was more and 
more the farther he into the region behind the village 
of which was full of of all kinds   
does it mean what is it whom are they at 
who is rostov kept asking as he came up to 
russian and soldiers running in confused across his path  
 devil knows they killed everybody it all up now 
he was told in russian german and by the crowd 
of who understood what was as little as he did 
  the shouted one   the devil take 
them    muttered a german    
     these russians   several 
men passed along the road and words of and mingled 
in a general then the died down rostov learned later 
that russian and soldiers had been at one another  
 god what does it all mean thought he  
here where at any moment the emperor may see them 
but no these must be only a of it will 
soon be over it can be that it can be 
only to get past them  the idea of and 
flight could not enter rostov head though he saw french 
and french on the just where he had been ordered 
to look for the commander in chief he could not 
did not wish to believe that     
 chapter xviii   rostov had been ordered to 
look for kutuzov and the emperor near the village of 
but neither they nor a single officer were there only 
of of kinds he on his already weary horse to 
get quickly past these but the farther he went the 
more they were the on which he had come out 
was with carriages of all sorts and russian and soldiers 
of all arms some and some not this whole and 
in under the influence of balls flying from the french 
on the   is the emperor where is kutuzov 
rostov kept asking everyone he could stop but got no 
answer from anyone  at last a by his collar 
he forced him to answer   brother they all 
long ago said the laughing for some reason and shaking 
himself free  having left that who was evidently drunk 
rostov stopped the horse of a or of some important 
and began to question him the man announced that the 
had been driven in a carriage at full speed about 
an hour before along that very road and that he 
was   can be said rostov  must have 
been someone else   saw him myself replied the 
man with a self smile of  ought to know 
the emperor by now after the times i seen him 
in petersburg i saw him just as i see you 
there he sat in the carriage as pale as anything 
how they made the four black horses fly gracious me 
they did past it time i knew the imperial horses 
and ilya i don think ilya anyone except the  
rostov let go of the horse and was about to 
ride on when a officer passing by addressed him  
 is it you want he asked  commander in 
chief he was killed by a ball in the breast 
before our regiment   killed another officer him  
 kutuzov asked rostov   kutuzov but what his 
name never mind there are not many left go that 
way to that village all the are there said the 
officer pointing to the village of and he walked on 
 rostov on at a not knowing why or to 
whom he was now going the emperor was the battle 
lost it was impossible to doubt it now rostov in 
the direction pointed out to him in which he saw 
and a what need to what was he now to 
say to the or to kutuzov even if they were 
and   this road your honor that way you 
will be killed at once a shouted to him  
kill you there   what are you talking about 
said another  is he to go that way is 
nearer  rostov considered and then went in the direction 
where they said he would be killed   all 
the same now if the emperor is am i to 
try to save myself he thought he on to the 
region where the greatest number of men had perished in 
from the french had not yet occupied that region and 
the russians and slightly left it long ago all about 
the field like of on well lay from ten to 
fifteen dead and to each of the together in and 
and one could hear their and sometimes feigned so it 
seemed to rostov he put his horse to a to 
avoid seeing all these suffering men and he felt afraid 
not for his life but for the courage he and 
which he knew would not stand the sight of these 
 the french who had ceased at this field with 
dead and where there was no one left to fire 
at on seeing an adjutant over it a on him 
and several the of those terrible sounds and of the 
around him in rostov mind into a single feeling of 
and pity for himself he remembered his mother last letter 
 would she feel thought he  she saw me 
here now on this field with the at me  
in the village of there were russian from the field 
of battle who though still in some were less the 
french did not reach there and the fire sounded far 
away here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle 
was lost no one whom rostov asked could tell him 
where the emperor or kutuzov was some said the report 
that the emperor was was correct others that it was 
not and explained the that had spread by the fact 
that the emperor carriage had really from the field of 
battle with the pale and terrified count who had out 
to the with others in the emperor one officer told 
rostov that he had seen someone from behind the village 
to the left and rostov not to find anyone but 
merely to ease his conscience when he had about two 
and had passed the last of the russian he saw 
near a kitchen garden with a round it two men 
on facing the one with a white plume in his 
hat seemed familiar to rostov the other on a beautiful 
horse  rostov he had seen before up to the 
struck his horse with his spurs and giving it the 
lightly over only a little earth from the bank under 
the horse turning the horse he again jumped the and 
addressed the with the white evidently suggesting that he should 
do the same the whose figure seemed familiar to rostov 
and his attention made a gesture of with his head 
and hand and by that gesture rostov instantly recognized his 
and adored monarch   it can be he alone 
in the midst of this empty field thought rostov at 
that moment alexander turned his head and rostov saw the 
features that were so deeply engraved on his memory the 
emperor was pale his and his eyes hollow but the 
the mildness of his features was all the greater rostov 
was happy in the assurance that the about the emperor 
being were he was happy to be seeing him he 
knew that he might and even ought to go straight 
to him and give the had ordered him to  
but as a youth in love is and not utter 
the thoughts he has of for but looks around for 
help or a of delay and flight when the moment 
comes and he is alone with her so rostov now 
that he had what he had for more than anything 
else in the world did not know how to the 
emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it 
would be and impossible to do so   it 
is as if i were glad of a to take 
of his being alone and a strange face may seem 
unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow 
besides what can i say to him now when my 
heart me and my mouth dry at the mere sight 
of him not one of the addressed to the emperor 
that he had in his could he now those were 
intended for quite other they were for the most part 
to be spoken at a moment of and generally when 
he was dying of and the sovereign had thanked him 
for and while dying he expressed the love his actions 
had   how can i ask the emperor for 
his for the right now that it is nearly four 
o and the battle is lost no certainly i must 
not him i must not on his reflections better die 
a thousand times than receiving an look or bad opinion 
from him rostov decided and and with a heart full 
despair he away continually looking back at the who still 
remained in the same attitude of  while rostov was 
thus arguing with himself and sadly away captain to ride 
to the same spot and seeing the emperor at once 
up to him offered his and him to cross the 
on foot the emperor wishing to rest and feeling sat 
down under an tree and remained beside him rostov from 
a distance saw with and how spoke long and warmly 
to the emperor and how the emperor evidently weeping covered 
his eyes with his hand and pressed hand   
i might have been in his place thought rostov and 
hardly restraining his tears of pity for the emperor he 
on in utter despair not knowing where to or why 
he was now  his despair was all the greater 
from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of 
his  he might not only might but should have 
gone up to the sovereign it was a to show 
his devotion to the emperor and he had not made 
use of it  have i done thought he and 
he turned round and back to the place where he 
had seen the emperor but there was no one the 
now only some and carriages were passing by from one 
of the he learned that kutuzov staff were not far 
off in the village the were going to rostov followed 
them in front of him walked kutuzov leading horses in 
then came a and behind that walked an old in 
a cap and coat   i say said the 
  answered the old man absent   a 
bit   you fool said the old man angrily 
some time passed in silence and then the same joke 
was repeated   before five in the evening the 
battle had been lost at all more than a hundred 
were already in the hands of the french  and 
his corps had laid down their arms other after losing 
half their men were in confused  the remains of 
and mingled forces were crowding around the and of the 
near the village of  after five o it was 
only at the that a hot  by the french 
alone was still to be heard from ranged on the 
of the at our forces  in the and others 
some kept up a fire at the french cavalry that 
was our it was growing on the where for so 
many years the old had been accustomed to sit in 
his cap while his with shirt sleeves rolled up the 
fish in the can on that over which for so 
many years in and blue had driven their two with 
and had returned with their that amid the and the 
under the horses and between the wheels men by fear 
of death now crowded together one another dying over the 
dying and one another only to move on a few 
steps and be killed themselves in the same way  
every ten a ball the air around or a burst 
in the midst of that some and with blood those 
near them  dolokhov an officer in the arm and 
on foot with the commander on and some ten men 
of his company all that was left of that whole 
regiment by the crowd they had got in at the 
to the and in on all sides had stopped because 
a horse in front had under a and the crowd 
were it out a ball killed someone behind them another 
fell in front and dolokhov with blood the crowd pushing 
forward desperately together moved a few steps and again stopped 
  on a hundred and we are certainly remain 
here another two minutes and it is certain death thought 
each one  dolokhov who was in the midst of 
the crowd forced his way to the edge of the 
two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the ice 
that covered the   this way he shouted over 
the ice which under him  this way he shouted 
to those with the   the ice bore him 
but it swayed and and it was plain that it 
would give way not only under a or a crowd 
but very soon even under his weight alone the men 
looked at him and pressed to the bank to step 
onto the ice the general on at the entrance to 
the raised his hand and opened his mouth to dolokhov 
suddenly a ball so low above the crowd that everyone 
it into something and the general fell from his horse 
in a of blood gave him a look or thought

     chapter xix   on 
the where he had with the in his hand lay 
prince andrew bolkonski and uttering a gentle piteous and childlike 
 toward evening he ceased and became quite still he 
did not know how long his suddenly he again felt 
that he was and suffering from a burning in his 
head   is it that lofty sky that i 
did not know till now but saw today was his 
first thought  i did not know this suffering either 
he thought  i did not know anything anything at 
all till now but where am i  he listened 
and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices speaking 
french he opened his eyes above him again was the 
same lofty sky with that had and were still higher 
and between them blue he did not turn his head 
and did not see those who by the sound of 
and voices had up and stopped near him  it 
was napoleon accompanied by two bonaparte over the had given 
final orders to the at the and was looking at 
the killed and left on the field   men 
remarked napoleon looking at a dead russian who with his 
face in the ground and a lay on his with 
an already arm wide   for the in position 
is exhausted your majesty said an adjutant who had come 
from the that were at   some brought from 
the reserve said napoleon and having gone on a few 
steps he stopped before prince andrew who lay on his 
back with the that had been dropped beside him  
flag had already been taken by the french as a 
  a fine death said napoleon as he gazed 
at bolkonski  prince andrew understood that this was said 
of him and that it was napoleon who said it 
he heard the speaker addressed as but he heard the 
words as he might have heard the of a fly 
not only did they not interest him but he took 
no notice of them and at once forgot them his 
head was burning he felt himself to death and he 
saw above him the lofty and sky he knew it 
was napoleon hero at that moment napoleon seemed to him 
such a small insignificant creature with what was passing now 
between himself and that lofty sky with the flying over 
it at that moment it meant nothing to him who 
might be standing over him or what was said of 
him he was only glad that people were standing near 
him and only wished that they would help him and 
bring him back to life which seemed to him so 
beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it 
so differently he all his strength to stir and utter 
a sound he feebly moved his and uttered a weak 
which his own pity   he is said napoleon 
 this young man up and carry him to the 
 having said this napoleon on to meet who hat 
in hand up smiling to the emperor to congratulate him 
on the  prince andrew remembered nothing more he lost 
consciousness from the terrible of being lifted onto the the 
while being moved and the of his wound at the 
he did not consciousness till late in the day when 
with other and captured russian officers he was carried to 
the hospital during this he felt a little and was 
able to look about him and even speak  the 
first words he heard on coming to his were those 
of a french officer who said rapidly  must halt 
here the emperor will pass here immediately it will please 
him to see these gentlemen prisoners   are so 
many prisoners today nearly the whole russian army that he 
is probably tired of them said another officer   
the same they say this one is the commander of 
all the emperor alexander guards said the first one indicating 
a russian officer in the white uniform of the horse 
guards  bolkonski recognized prince whom he had met in 
petersburg society beside him stood a lad of also a 
officer of the horse guards  bonaparte having come up 
at a stopped his horse   is the senior 
he asked on seeing the prisoners  they named the 
colonel prince   are the commander of the emperor 
alexander regiment of horse guards asked napoleon   a 
replied   regiment its duty said napoleon   
praise of a great commander is a highest reward said 
  it with pleasure said napoleon  who is 
that young man beside you  prince named lieutenant  
after looking at him napoleon smiled   very young 
to come to with us   is no to 
courage muttered in a voice   splendid reply said 
napoleon  man you will go far  prince andrew 
who had also been brought forward before the emperor eyes 
to complete the show of prisoners could not to attract 
his attention napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the and 
addressing him again used the  man that was connected 
in his memory with prince andrew   and you 
young man said he  do you feel mon  
though five minutes before prince andrew had been able to 
say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying 
him now with his eyes fixed straight on napoleon he 
was silent so insignificant at that moment seemed to him 
all the interests that napoleon so mean did his hero 
himself with his vanity and joy in appear to the 
lofty and kindly sky which he had seen and understood 
that he could not answer him  everything seemed so 
and insignificant in with the stern and solemn train of 
thought that weakness from of blood suffering and the of 
death in him looking into napoleon eyes prince andrew thought 
of the of greatness the of life which no one 
could understand and the still greater of death the meaning 
of which no one could understand or explain  the 
emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said 
to one of the officers as he went  these 
gentlemen attended to and taken to my let my doctor 
their au revoir prince and he his horse and away 
 his face shone with self and pleasure  the 
soldiers who had carried prince andrew had noticed and taken 
the little gold princess mary had round her brother neck 
but seeing the favor the emperor showed the prisoners they 
now hastened to return the  prince andrew did not 
see how and by whom it was replaced but the 
little with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his 
chest outside his uniform   would be good thought 
prince andrew glancing at the his sister had round his 
neck with such and  would be good if everything 
were as clear and simple as it seems to mary 
how good it would be to know where to for 
help in this life and what to expect after it 
the grave how happy and calm i should be if 
i could now say  have mercy on me but 
to whom should i say that either to a power 
which i not only cannot but which i cannot even 
express in words great all or nothing said he to 
himself  to that god who has been into this 
by mary there is nothing certain nothing at all except 
the of everything i understand and the greatness of something 
but all  the moved on at every he again 
felt his and he grew of his father wife sister 
and future son and the tenderness he had felt the 
night before the battle the figure of the insignificant little 
napoleon and above all this the lofty sky formed the 
chief of his fancies  the quiet home life and 
happiness of bald hills itself to him he was already 
that happiness when that little napoleon had suddenly appeared with 
his look of at the of others and and torments 
had followed and only the promised peace toward morning all 
these and into the and of and which in the 
opinion of napoleon doctor was much more likely to end 
in death than in   is a nervous subject 
said  will not  and prince andrew with others 
was left to the care of the of the  
    book four     
  chapter i   early in the year 
 nicholas rostov returned home on leave was going home 
to and rostov him to travel with him as far 
as moscow and to stay with him there meeting a 
at the last post but one before moscow had drunk 
three bottles of wine with him and despite the across

was only three from his door it seemed to him 
the horses were not moving at all at last the 
bore to the right drew up at an entrance and 
rostov saw the old familiar with a bit of broken 
off the porch and the post by the side of 
the pavement he out before the stopped and ran into 
the hall the house stood cold and silent as if 
quite of who had come to it there was no 
one in the hall  god is everyone all right 
he thought stopping for a moment with a heart and 
then immediately starting to run along the hall and up 
the steps of the familiar staircase the well old door 
handle which always the countess when it was not properly 
turned as as ever a in the anteroom  old 
michael was on the chest the footman who was so 
strong that he could lift the back of the carriage 
from behind sat slippers out of he looked up at 
the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly 
changed to one of delighted amazement   the young 
count he cried his young  it be my treasure 
and with excitement rushed toward the drawing door probably in 
order to announce him but changing his mind came back 
and stooped to kiss the young man shoulder   
well asked rostov drawing away his arm   god 
be thanked yes they just finished supper let me have 
a look at you your excellency   everything quite 
all right   be thanked yes  rostov who 
had completely forgotten not wishing anyone to him threw off 
his coat and ran on through the large dark ballroom 
all was the same there were the same old card 
tables and the same with a over it but someone 
had already seen the young and before he had reached 
the drawing room something out from a side door like 
a and began hugging and kissing him another and yet 
another creature of the same kind from a second door 
and a third more hugging more kissing more and tears 
of joy he could not distinguish which was papa which

had pulled him down toward her and covered his face 
with holding him by the of his coat away and 
up and down in one place like a and  
all around were eyes with tears of joy and all 
around were lips a kiss  sonya too all rosy 
red clung to his arm and radiant with looked eagerly 
toward his eyes waiting for the look for which she 
sonya now was sixteen and she was very pretty especially 
at this moment of happy rapturous excitement she gazed at 
him not taking her eyes off him and smiling and 
holding her he gave her a grateful look but was 
still expectant and looking for someone the old countess had 
not yet come but now steps were heard at the 
door steps so that they could hardly be his mother 
 yet it was she dressed in a new gown 
which he did not know made since he had left 
all the others let him go and he ran to 
her when they met she fell on his breast sobbing 
she could not lift her face but only pressed it 
to the cold of his hussar jacket who had come 
into the room by anyone stood there and his eyes 
at the sight   your son friend he said 
himself to the count who was looking inquiringly at him

the figure of   screamed natasha beside herself with 
to him putting her arms round him and kissing him 
this escapade made everybody feel confused blushed too but smiled 
and taking natasha hand kissed it  was shown to 
the room prepared for him and the rostovs all gathered 
round nicholas in the sitting room  the old countess 
not letting go of his hand and kissing it every 
moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched 
every movement word or look of his never taking their 
eyes off him his brother and sisters for the places 
to him and with one another who should bring him 
his tea handkerchief and pipe  rostov was very happy 
in the love they showed him but the first moment 
of meeting had been so that his present joy seemed 
and he kept expecting something more more and yet more 
 next morning after the of their the till ten 
o  in the room next their there was a 
of open and dirty two with spurs had just been 
placed by the wall the were bringing in and hot 
water for and their well clothes there was a masculine

opened a and there was a of something blue of 
ribbons black hair and merry faces it was natasha sonya 
and petya who had come to see whether they were 
getting up   get up natasha voice was again 
heard at the door    meanwhile petya having 
found and seized the in the outer room with the 
boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother 
and forgetting that it was for the girls to see 
men opened the door   this your saber he 
shouted  the girls aside hid his legs under the 
looking with a scared face at his for help the 
door having let petya in closed again a sound of 
laughter came from behind it   come out in 
your gown said natasha voice   this your saber 
asked petya  is it yours he said addressing the 
black with  rostov hurriedly put something on his feet 
drew on his gown and went out natasha had put 
on one and was just getting her foot into the 
other sonya when he came in was round and was 
about to her dresses into a and sit down they 
were dressed alike in new pale and were both fresh 
rosy and bright sonya ran away but natasha taking her 
brother arm led him into the sitting room where they 
began talking they hardly gave one another time to ask 
questions and give a thousand little matters which could not 
interest anyone but themselves natasha laughed at every word he 
said or that she said herself not because what they 
were saying was amusing but because she felt happy and 
was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by 
laughter   how nice how splendid she said to 
everything  rostov felt that under the influence of the 
warm of love that childlike smile which had not once 
appeared on his face since he left home now for 
the first time after months again brightened his soul and 
his face   but listen she said  you 
are quite a man you i glad you my brother 
she touched his mustache  want to know what you 
men are like are you the same as we no 
  did sonya run away asked rostov   
yes that a whole long story how are you going 
to speak to her or you   may happen 
said rostov   call her you please i tell 
you all about it some other time no i tell 
you now you know sonya my friend such a friend 
that i my arm for her sake look here  
she pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a 
red on her long slender delicate arm high above the 
elbow on that part that is covered even by a 
ball dress   this to prove my love for 
her i just a in the fire and pressed it 
there  sitting on the sofa with the little on 
its arms in what used to be his old and 
looking into natasha bright eyes rostov that world of home 
and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else but 
gave him some of the best joys of his life 
and the burning of an arm with a as a 
of love did not seem to him he understood and 
was not surprised at it   and is that 
all he asked   are such friends such friends 
all that business was just nonsense but we are friends 
forever she if she anyone does it for life but 
i don understand that i forget quickly   what 
then   she me and you like that  
natasha suddenly flushed   you remember before you went 
away well she says you are to forget all that 
she says  shall love him always but let him 
be free isn that lovely and noble yes very noble 
isn it asked natasha so seriously and that it was 
evident that what she was now saying she had talked 
of before with tears  rostov became thoughtful   
never go back on my word he said  sonya 
is so charming that only a fool would such happiness 
  no cried natasha  and i have already 
talked it over we knew you say so but it 
won do because you see if you say that you 
consider yourself by your promise will seem as if she 
had not meant it seriously it makes it as if 
you were marrying her because you must and that do 
at all  rostov saw that it had been well 
considered by them sonya had already struck him by her 
beauty on the day today when he had caught a 
of her she seemed still more lovely she was a 
charming girl of sixteen evidently passionately in love with him 
 did not doubt that for an instant why should 
he not love her now and even marry her rostov 
thought but just now there were so many other and 
interests before him  they have taken a decision he 
thought  must remain free   then that excellent 
said he  talk it over later on oh how 
glad i am to have you   and are 
you still true to boris he continued   what 
nonsense cried natasha laughing  don think about him or 
anyone else and i don want anything of the kind 
  me then what are you up to now 
  repeated natasha and a happy smile lit up 
her face  you seen     seen 
famous well then you won understand that what i up 
to  her arms natasha held out her as do 
ran back a few steps turned cut a brought her 
little feet together and made some steps on the very 
tips of her   i standing see she said 
but could not maintain herself on her any longer  
that what i up to i never marry anyone but 
will be a only don tell anyone  rostov laughed 
so loud and merrily that in his felt envious and 
natasha could not help joining in   but don 
you think it nice she kept repeating   and 
so you no longer wish to marry boris  natasha 
up  don want to marry anyone and i tell 
him so when i see him   me said 
rostov   that all natasha on  is nice 
she asked   indeed   well then good 
go and dress is he very terrible   terrible 
asked nicholas  is a splendid fellow   call 
him that funny and is he very nice   
  then be quick we all have together  
and natasha rose and went out of the room on 
like a but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen 
can smile when rostov met sonya in the drawing room 
he he did not know how to behave with her 
the evening before in the first happy moment of meeting 
they had kissed each other but today they felt it 
could not be done he felt that everybody including his 
mother and sisters was looking inquiringly at him and watching 
to see how he would behave with her he kissed 
her hand and addressed her not as but as you 
but their eyes met and said and exchanged tender her 
looks asked him to forgive her for having dared by 
natasha to him of his promise and then thanked him 
for his love his looks thanked her for him his 
freedom and told her that one way or another he 
would never to love her for that would be impossible 
  strange it is said vera a moment when 
all were silent  sonya and nicholas now say you 
to one another and meet like  vera remark was 
correct as her remarks always were but like most of 
her it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only sonya nicholas 
and natasha but even the old countess who this love 
affair which might nicholas from making a brilliant match like 
a girl  to rostov surprise appeared in the drawing 
room with hair and in a new uniform looking just 
as as he made himself when going into battle and 
he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than 
rostov had ever expected to see him    
  chapter ii   on his return to 
moscow from the army nicholas rostov was by his home 
circle as the best of sons a hero and their 
darling by his relations as a charming attractive and polite 
young man by his as a handsome lieutenant of hussars 
a good and one of the best in the city 
 the rostovs knew everybody in moscow the old count 
had money enough that year as all his estates had 
been and so nicholas a of his own very breeches 
of the latest cut such as no one else yet 
had in moscow and of the latest fashion with pointed 
and small silver spurs passed his time very gaily after 
a short period of himself to the old of life 
nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again 
he felt that he had grown up and very much 
his despair at in a his money from to pay 
a his kissing sonya on the sly now recalled all 
this as he had left behind now he was a 
lieutenant of hussars in a jacket with silver and wearing 
the cross of st george to soldiers for in and 
in the company of well elderly and respected men was 
a of his own for a race he knew a 
lady on one of the whom he of an evening 
he led the at the arkharovs ball talked about the 
war with field the english club and was on intimate 
terms with a colonel of forty to whom had introduced 
him  his for the emperor had in moscow but 
still as he did not see him and had no 
opportunity of seeing him he often spoke about him and 
about his love for him letting it be understood that 
he had not told all and that there was something 
in his for the emperor not everyone could understand and 
with his whole soul he the adoration then common in 
moscow for the emperor who was spoken of as the 
  during rostov short stay in moscow before the 
army he did not draw closer to sonya but rather 
away from her she was very pretty and sweet and 
evidently deeply in love with him but he was at 
the period of youth when there seems so much to 
do that there is no time for that sort of 
thing and a young man to himself and his freedom 
which he for so many other things when he thought 
of sonya during this stay in moscow he said to 
himself  there will be and there are many more 
such girls somewhere whom i do not yet know there 
will be time enough to think about love when i 
want to but now i have no time besides it 
seemed to him that the society of women was rather 
to his he went to balls and into ladies society 
with an affectation of doing so against his will the 
the english club with and visits to a certain house 
was another matter and quite the thing for a young 
hussar  at the beginning of march old count ilya 
rostov was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of 
prince at the english club  the count walked up 
and down the hall in his gown giving orders to 
the club and to the famous the club head cook 
about fresh and fish for this dinner the count had 
been a member and on the of the club from 
the day it was to him the club the of 
the in honor of for few men knew so well 
how to arrange a on an open scale and still 
men would be so well able and to make up 
out of their own what might be for the success 
of the fete the club cook and the listened to 
the count orders with pleased faces for they knew that 
under no other could they so easily a good for 
themselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles   
then mind and have in the turtle you know  
 we have three cold dishes then asked the cook 
 the count considered   can have less three 
the that one said he bending down a finger  
 am i to order those large asked the  
 it can be helped if they won take less 
ah dear me i was forgetting we must have another 
ah goodness gracious he clutched at his head  is 
going to get me the flowers dmitri eh dmitri off 
to our moscow he said to the who appeared at 
his call  off and tell the to set the 
serfs to work say that everything out of the must 
be brought here well wrapped up in felt i must 
have two hundred here on  having given several more 
orders he was about to go to his  countess 
to have a rest but something else of importance he 
returned again called back the cook and the club and 
again began giving orders a light and the of spurs 
were heard at the door and the young count handsome 
rosy with a dark little mustache evidently rested and made 
by his easy life in moscow entered the room  
 my boy my head in a whirl said the 
old man with a smile as if he felt a 
little confused before his son  if you would only 
help a bit i must have too i shall have 
my own but we get the as well you military 
men like that sort of thing   papa i 
believe prince himself less before the battle of than you 
do now said his son with a smile  the 
old count pretended to be angry   you talk 
but try it yourself  and the count turned to 
the cook who with a and expression looked and sympathetically 
at the father and son   have the young 
people come to eh said he  at us old 
fellows   so your excellency all they have to 
do is to eat a good dinner but it and 
serving it all up that not their business

by both hands he cried  i got you so

and tell him  ilya has sent you to ask 
for and fresh pineapples we can get them from anyone 
else he not there himself so you have to go 
in and ask the princesses and from there go on 
to the knows look up the the one who danced 
at count orlov you remember in a white cossack coat 
and bring him along to me   am i 
to bring the girls along with him asked nicholas laughing 
 dear  at that moment with footsteps and with 
the yet christian look which never left her face anna 
mikhaylovna entered the hall though she came upon the count 
in his gown every day he became confused and begged 
her to excuse his   matter at all my 
dear count she said her eyes  i go to 
bezukhov myself pierre has arrived and now we shall get 
anything we want from his i have to see him 
in any case he has forwarded me a letter from 
boris thank god boris is now on the staff  
the count was delighted at anna mikhaylovna taking upon herself 
one of his and ordered the small closed carriage for 
her   bezukhov to come i put his name 
down is his wife with him he asked  anna 
mikhaylovna turned up her eyes and profound sadness was on 
her face   my dear friend he is very 
unfortunate she said  what we hear is true it

we were at his happiness and such a lofty soul 
as young bezukhov yes i pity him from my heart 
and shall try to give him what i can

rostov  anna mikhaylovna deeply   mary ivanovna son 
she said in a whisper  her completely they say 
pierre took him up him to his house in petersburg 
and now she has come here and that after her 
said anna mikhaylovna wishing to show her sympathy for pierre 
but by involuntary and a half smile betraying her sympathy 
for the  as she called dolokhov  say pierre 
is quite broken by his   dear but still 
tell him to come to the club will all blow 
over it will be a tremendous  next day the 
third of march soon after one o two hundred and 
fifty members of the english club and fifty guests were 
awaiting the of honor and hero of the prince to 
dinner  on the first arrival of the news of 
the battle of moscow had been at that time the 
russians were so used to that on receiving news of 
the some would simply not believe it while others some 
extraordinary of so strange an in the english club where 
all who were distinguished important and well when the news 
began to arrive in nothing was said about the war 
and the last battle as though all were in a 
of silence the men who set the tone in conversation 
prince count and prince not show themselves at the club 
but met in private in intimate and the who took 
their opinions from others rostov among them for a while 
without any definite opinion on the subject of the war 
and without the felt that something was wrong and that 
to discuss the bad news was difficult and so it 
was best to be silent but after a while just 
as a comes out of its room the who the 
club opinion and everybody began speaking clearly and reasons were 
found for the incredible and impossible of a russian everything 
became clear and in all corners of moscow the same 
things began to be said these reasons were the of 
the a the of the pole and of the frenchman 
kutuzov and  was whispered the youth and of the 
sovereign who had and insignificant people but the army the 
russian army everyone declared was extraordinary and had of the 
soldiers officers and were but the hero of was prince 
distinguished by his affair and by the from where he 
alone had his and had all day back an force 
twice as as his own what also to being as 
moscow hero was the fact that he had no connections 
in the city and was a stranger there in his 
person honor was shown to a simple russian without connections 
and intrigues and to one who was by of the 
italian with the name of suvorov moreover paying such honor 
to was the best way of expressing and of kutuzov 
  there been no it would have been necessary 
to him said the wit shinshin the words of kutuzov 
no one spoke of except some who him in calling 
him a court and an old  all moscow repeated 
prince saying  you go on and you must get 
with suggesting for our by the memory of former and 
the words of that french soldiers have to be to 
battle by words and by to show them that it 
is more dangerous to run away than to but that 
russian soldiers only need to be and held back on 
all sides new and fresh were heard of of shown 
by our officers and men at one had a another 
had killed five a third had five berg was mentioned 
by those who did not know him as having when 
in the right hand taken his sword in the left 
and gone forward of bolkonski nothing was said and only 
those who knew him that he had died so young 
leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father   
   chapter iii   on that third 
of march all the rooms in the english club were 
filled with a of conversation like the of bees in 
the members and guests of the club and sat stood 
met and some in uniform and some in evening dress 
and a few here and there with hair and in 
russian footmen in livery with shoes and stockings stood at 
every door anxiously visitors every movement in order to their 
most of those present were elderly respected men with broad 
self faces fat fingers and resolute gestures and voices this 
class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places 
and met in certain habitual groups a of those present 
were guests young men among whom were rostov and dolokhov 
was now again an officer in the semenov regiment the 
faces of these young people especially those who were military 
men bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders 
which seems to say to the older generation  are 
prepared to respect and honor you but all the same 
remember that the future belongs to us  was there 
as an old member of the club pierre who at 
his wife command had let his hair grow and his 
spectacles went about the rooms dressed but looking sad and 
dull here as he was by an of to his 
wealth and being in the habit of it over these 
people he treated them with absent  by his age 
he should have belonged to the younger men but by 
his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups old 
and guests and so he went from one group to 
another some of the most important old men were the 
center of groups which even approached respectfully to hear the 
voices of well men the formed round count and was 
how the russians had been by flying and had had 
to force their way through them with  was telling 
that had been sent from petersburg to what moscow was 
thinking about  in the third circle was speaking of 
the meeting of the of war at which suvorov like 
a in reply to the nonsense talked by the shinshin 
standing close by tried to make a joke saying that 
kutuzov had evidently failed to learn from suvorov even so 
simple a thing as the art of like a but 
the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him 
feel that in that place and on that day it 
was to speak so of kutuzov  count ilya rostov 
hurried and went about in his soft between the dining 
and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important and all of 
whom he knew as if they were all while his 
eyes occasionally out his fine well young son resting on 
him and winking joyfully at him young rostov stood at 
a window with dolokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made 
and highly the old count came up to them and 
pressed dolokhov hand   come and visit us you 
know my boy been together out there both playing the 
hero ah vasili how d do old fellow he said 
turning to an old man who was passing but before 
he had finished his greeting there was a general stir 
and a footman who had run in announced with a 
frightened face  arrived  rang the rushed forward and 
together in a guests who had been about in different 
rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room 
by the door of the ballroom  appeared in the 
doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword which in 
accord with the club custom he had given up to 
the hall porter he had no cap on his head 
nor had he a over his shoulder as when rostov 
had seen him on the of the battle of but 
wore a new uniform with russian and foreign orders and 
the star of st george on his left breast evidently 
just before coming to the dinner he had had his 
hair and trimmed which changed his appearance for the worse 
there was something naively in his air which in with 
his firm and features gave him a rather expression and 
who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to 
allow him as the of honor to enter first was 
not wishing to himself of their and this some delay 
at the doors but after all he did at last 
enter first he walked and awkwardly over the floor of 
the reception room not knowing what to do with his 
hands he was more accustomed to walk over a field 
under fire as he had done at the head of 
the regiment at he would have found that the met 
him at the first door and expressing their at seeing 
such a highly took of him as it were without 
waiting for his reply him and led him to the 
drawing room it was at first impossible to enter the 
drawing door for the crowd of members and guests one 
another and trying to get a good look at over 
each other shoulders as if he were some rare animal 
count ilya rostov laughing and repeating the words  way 
dear boy make way make way pushed through the crowd 
more than anyone led the guests into the drawing room 
and seated them on the center sofa the the most 
respected members of the club the new arrivals count ilya 
again his way through the crowd went out of the 
drawing room and a minute later with another carrying a 
large silver which he to prince on the lay some 
verses and in the hero honor on seeing the glanced 
around in dismay as though help but all eyes demanded 
that he should feeling himself in their power he took 
the with both hands and looked sternly and at the 
count who had it to him someone took the dish 
from  he would it seemed have held it till 
evening and have gone in to dinner with it and 
drew his attention to the verses   i will 
read them then seemed to say and his weary eyes 
on the paper began to read them with a fixed 
and serious expression but the himself took the verses and 
began reading them aloud bowed his head and listened  
   bring glory then to alexander   
 and on the throne our    a 
foe be kindhearted as a man    a 
at home a caesar in the field    
napoleon    knows by experience now   
 and not russians trouble  but before he had 
finished reading a major announced that dinner was ready the 
door opened and from the dining room came the strains 
of the     joyful    
russians now  and count rostov glancing angrily at the 
who went on reading his verses bowed to everyone rose 
feeling that dinner was more important than verses and again 
all the rest went in to dinner he was seated 
in the place of honor between two and was a 
significant to the name of the sovereign three hundred persons 
took their seats in the dining room to their rank 
and importance the more important nearer to the as naturally 
as water where the land lies lowest  just before 
dinner count ilya rostov his son to who recognized him 
and said a few words to him and awkward as 
were all the words he spoke that day and count 
ilya looked joyfully and around while spoke to his son 
 nicholas rostov with and his new acquaintance dolokhov sat 
almost at the middle of the table facing them sat 
pierre beside prince count ilya rostov with the other members 
of the sat facing and as the very of moscow 
did the to the prince  his had not been 
in vain the dinner both the and the other was 
splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till 
the end of the he at the butler whispered directions 
to the footmen and each expected dish with some anxiety 
everything was excellent with the second course a gigantic  
sight of which ilya rostov blushed with self pleasure the 
footmen began and filling the champagne glasses after the fish 
which made a certain the count exchanged glances with the 
other  will be many it time to begin he 
whispered and taking up his glass he rose all were 
silent waiting for what he would say   the 
health of our sovereign the emperor he cried and at 
the same moment his kindly eyes grew with tears of 
joy and enthusiasm the band immediately struck up  joyful 
all rose and cried  also rose and shouted  
in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted 
it on the field at young rostov ecstatic voice could 
be heard above the three hundred others he nearly wept 
 the health of our sovereign the emperor he  
and emptying his glass at one he dashed it to 
the floor many followed his example and the loud shouting 
continued for a long time when the voices the footmen 
away the broken glass and everybody sat down again smiling 
at the noise they had made and exchanging remarks the 
old count rose once more glanced at a note lying 
beside his plate and a  the health of the 
hero of our last prince peter and again his blue 
eyes grew  cried the three hundred voices again but 
instead of the band a began a by kutuzov  
   russians o all on    
courage    have we not    
he foe men to their knees   as soon 
as the was over another and another was and count 
ilya rostov became more and more moved more glass was 
smashed and the shouting grew louder they drank to to 
the to all the club members and to all the 
club guests and finally to count ilya rostov separately as 
the of the at that the count took out his 
handkerchief and his face wept outright     
 chapter iv   pierre sat opposite dolokhov and 
nicholas rostov as usual he ate and drank much and 
eagerly but those who knew him noticed that some great 
change had come over him that day he was silent 
all through dinner and looked about and scowling or with 
fixed eyes and a look of complete absent kept rubbing 
the bridge of his nose his face was depressed and 
gloomy he seemed to see and hear nothing of what 
was going on around him and to be by some 
and problem  the problem that tormented him was by 
given by the princess his cousin at moscow dolokhov with 
his wife and by an letter he had received that 
morning which in the mean way common to said that 
he saw badly through his spectacles but that his wife 
connection with dolokhov was a secret to no one but 
himself pierre absolutely both the princess and the letter but 
he feared now to look at dolokhov who was sitting 
opposite him every time he to meet dolokhov handsome insolent 
eyes pierre felt something terrible and rising in his soul 
and turned quickly away his wife past and her relations 
with dolokhov pierre saw clearly that what was said in 
the letter might be true or might at least seem 
to be true had it not to his wife he 
remembered how dolokhov who had fully his former position after 
the had returned to petersburg and come to him availing 
himself of his friendly relations with pierre as a companion 
dolokhov had come straight to his house and pierre had 
put him up and him money pierre recalled how helene 
had smilingly expressed of dolokhov living at their house and 
how dolokhov had his wife beauty to him and from 
that time till they came to moscow had not left 
them for a day   he is very handsome 
thought pierre  i know him it would be particularly 
pleasant to him to dishonor my name and me just 
because i have myself on his behalf him and helped 
him i know and understand what a that would add 
to the pleasure of me if it really were true 
yes if it were true but i do not believe 
it i have no right to and can believe it 
he remembered the expression dolokhov face assumed in his moments 
of as when tying the policeman to the bear and 
dropping them into the water or when he a man 
to a without any reason or a post horse with 
a that expression was often on dolokhov face when looking 
at him  he is a thought pierre  kill 
a man means nothing to him it must seem to 
him that everyone is afraid of him and that must 
please him he must think that i too am afraid 
of him in fact i am afraid of him he 
thought and again he felt something terrible and rising in 
his soul dolokhov and rostov were now sitting opposite pierre 
and seemed very gay rostov was talking merrily to his 
two friends one of whom was a hussar and the 
other a notorious duelist and and every now and then 
he glanced ironically at pierre whose absent and figure was 
a very one at the dinner rostov looked at pierre 
first because pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a 
rich civilian the husband of a beauty and in a 
word old woman and because pierre in his and absent 
had not recognized rostov and had not to his greeting 
when the emperor health was drunk pierre lost in thought 
did not rise or lift his glass   are 
you about shouted rostov looking at him in an of 
 you hear it his majesty the emperor health  
pierre rose his glass and waiting till all were seated 
again turned with his kindly smile to rostov   
i didn recognize you he said but rostov was engaged 
he was shouting    don you the acquaintance 
said dolokhov to rostov   him he a fool 
said rostov   should make up to the husbands 
of pretty women said  pierre did not catch what 
they were saying but knew they were talking about him 
he and turned away   now to the health 
of handsome women said dolokhov and with a serious expression 
but with a smile at the corners of his mouth 
he turned with his glass to pierre   to 
the health of lovely women their he added  pierre 
with eyes drank out of his glass without looking at 
dolokhov or answering him the footman who was with kutuzov 
laid one before pierre as one of the guests he 
was just going to take it when dolokhov across it 
from his hand and began reading it pierre looked at 
dolokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and that 
had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took of him 
he leaned his whole body across the table   
you take it he shouted  hearing that cry and 
seeing to whom it was addressed and the on his 
right quickly turned in alarm to bezukhov   don 
what are you about whispered their frightened voices  dolokhov 
looked at pierre with clear cruel eyes and that smile 
of his which seemed to say  this is what 
i like   have it he said distinctly  
pale with quivering lips pierre the copy   you 
i challenge you he and pushing back his chair he 
rose from the table  at the very instant he 
did this and uttered those words pierre felt that the 
question of his wife which had been him the whole 
day was finally and answered in the he her and 
was forever from her despite request that he would take 
no part in the matter rostov agreed to be dolokhov 
second and after dinner he discussed the for the with 
bezukhov second pierre went home but rostov with dolokhov and 
stayed on at the club till late listening to the 
and other   then till tomorrow at said dolokhov 
as he took leave of rostov in the club porch 
  do you feel quite calm rostov asked  
dolokhov paused   you see i tell you the 
whole secret of in two words if you are going 
to fight a and you make a will and write 
affectionate to your parents and if you think you may 
be killed you are a fool and are lost for 
certain but go with the firm intention of your man 
as quickly and as possible and then all will be 
right as our bear at used to tell me  
a bear he says  when you see one your 
fear all gone and your only thought is not to 
let him get away and that how it is with 
me a mon cher       
  till tomorrow my dear fellow   next 
day at eight in the morning pierre and drove to 
the forest and found dolokhov and rostov already there pierre 
had the air of a man with which had no 
connection with the matter in hand his face was he 
had evidently not that night he looked about and screwed 
up his eyes as if by the sun he was 
entirely by two his wife of which after his night 
he had not the slightest doubt and the of dolokhov 
who had no reason to the honor of a man 
who was nothing to him  should perhaps have done 
the same thing in his place thought pierre  even 
certain that i should have done the same then why 
this this murder either i shall kill him or he 
will hit me in the head or elbow or knee 
can i go away from here run away myself somewhere 
passed through his mind but just at moments when such 
thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly 
calm and absent way which inspired the respect of the 
 it be long are things ready  when all 
was ready the stuck in the snow to mark the 
and the went up to pierre   should not 
be doing my duty count he said in timid tones 
 should not justify your confidence and the honor you 
have done me in choosing me for your second if 
at this grave this very grave moment i did not 
tell you the whole truth i think there is no 
sufficient ground for this affair or for blood to be 
over it you were not right not quite in the 
right you were   yes it is stupid said 
pierre   allow me to express your and i 
am sure your will accept them said  like the 
others concerned in the affair and like everyone in did 
not yet believe that the affair had come to an 
 know count it is much more honorable to admit 
one mistake than to let matters become there was no 
on either side allow me to   what is 
there to talk about said pierre  all the same 
is everything ready he added  tell me where to 
go and where to he said with an unnaturally gentle 
smile  he took the in his hand and began 
asking about the of the as he had not before 
held a in his hand fact that he did not 
wish to confess   yes like that i know 
i only forgot said he   none said dolokhov 
to  on his side had been a and he 
also went up to the appointed place  the spot 
for the was some eighty from the road where the 
had been left in a small in the forest covered 
with snow the having to break up during the last 
few days the stood forty apart at the farther edge 
of the the the left in the deep snow between 
the place where they had been standing and and dolokhov 
which were stuck into the ground ten apart to mark 
the it was and at forty distance nothing could be 
seen for three minutes all had been ready but they 
still and all were silent      
chapter v    begin said dolokhov   
right said pierre still smiling in the same way a 
feeling of was in the air it was evident that 
the affair so lightly could no longer be but was 
taking its course of men will  first went to 
the and announced  the have a please take your 
and at the word begin to   he shouted 
angrily and stepped aside  the along the trodden nearer 
and nearer to one another beginning to see one another 
through the they had the right to fire when they 
liked as they approached the dolokhov walked slowly without raising 
his looking with his bright sparkling blue eyes into his 
face his mouth wore its usual of a smile  
 i can fire when i like said pierre and 
at the word  he went quickly forward missing the 
trodden path and into the deep snow he held the 
in his right hand at arm length apparently afraid of 
himself with it his left hand he held carefully back 
because he wished to support his right hand with it 
and knew he must not do so having six and 
strayed off the into the snow pierre looked down at 
his feet then quickly glanced at dolokhov and bending his 
finger as he had been shown not at all expecting 
so loud a report pierre at the sound and then 
smiling at his own stood still the smoke by the 
prevented him from seeing anything for an instant but there 
was no second report as he had expected he only 
heard dolokhov hurried steps and his figure came in through 
the smoke he was pressing one hand to his left 
side while the other clutched his drooping his face was 
pale rostov ran toward him and said something   
muttered dolokhov through his teeth  it not over and 
after stumbling a few steps right up to the saber 
he on the snow beside it his left hand was 
he it on his coat and himself with it his 
frowning face was and quivered   began dolokhov but 
could not at first pronounce the word   he 
uttered with an effort  pierre hardly restraining his began 
running toward dolokhov and was about to cross the space 
between the when dolokhov cried   your and pierre 
what was meant stopped by his saber only ten divided 
them dolokhov lowered his head to the snow bit at 
it again raised his head adjusted himself drew in his 
legs and sat up a firm center of gravity he 
and the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes 
still smiling with effort and as he his remaining strength 
he raised his and   yourself with your  
 yourself even cried to his  pierre with a 
gentle smile of pity and his arms and legs spread 
out stood with his broad chest facing dolokhov looked at 
him rostov and closed their eyes at the same instant 
they heard a report and dolokhov angry cry   
shouted dolokhov and he lay face downwards on the snow 
 pierre clutched his and turning round went into the 
forest through the deep snow and muttering words   
folly death lies he repeated puckering his face  stopped 
him and took him home  rostov and drove away 
with the dolokhov  the latter lay silent in the 
with closed eyes and did not answer a word to 
the questions addressed to him but on entering moscow he 
suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort 
took rostov who was sitting beside him by the hand 
rostov was struck by the altered and unexpectedly rapturous and 
tender expression on dolokhov face   how do you 
feel he asked   but it not that my 
friend said dolokhov with a voice  are we in 
moscow i know i don matter but i have killed 
her killed she won get over it she won  
 asked rostov   mother my mother my my 
adored mother and dolokhov pressed rostov hand and burst into 
tears  when he had become a little he explained 
to rostov that he was living with his mother who 
if she saw him dying would not it he rostov 
to go on and prepare her  rostov went on 
to do what was asked and to his great surprise 
learned that dolokhov the dolokhov the lived in moscow with 
an old mother and a sister and was the most 
affectionate of sons and      chapter 
vi   pierre had of late seen his wife 
alone both in petersburg and in moscow their house was 
always full of visitors the night after the he did 
not go to his but as he often did remained 
in his father room that huge room in which count 
bezukhov had died  he lay down on the sofa 
meaning to fall and forget all that had happened to 
him but could not do so such a of thoughts 
and suddenly within him that he could not fall nor 
even remain in one place but had to jump up 
and the room with steps now he seemed to see 
her in the early days of their with bare shoulders 
and a passionate look on her face and then immediately 
he saw beside her dolokhov handsome insolent hard and face 
as he had seen it at the and then that 
same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been 
when he and on the snow   has happened 
he asked himself  have killed her yes killed my 
wife yes that was it and why how did i 
come to do it you married her answered an inner 
voice   in what was i to he asked 
 marrying her without her in yourself and her and 
he recalled that moment after supper at prince vasili when 
he spoke those words he had found so difficult to 
utter  love you  all comes from that even 
then i felt it he thought  felt then that 
it was not so that i had no right to 
do it and so it out  he remembered his 
and blushed at the particularly humiliating and shameful was the 
of how one day soon after his he came out 
of the into his study a little before in his 
silk gown and found his head there who respectfully looked 
into his face and at his gown and smiled slightly 
as if expressing understanding of his happiness   how 
often i have felt proud of her proud of her 
beauty and social tact thought he  proud of my 
house in which she received all petersburg proud of her 
and beauty so this is what i was proud of 
i then thought that i did not understand her how 
often when considering her character i have told myself that 
i was to for not understanding her for not understanding 
that constant and and lack of all interests or desires 
and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that 
she is a woman now i have spoken that terrible 
word to myself all has become clear   used 
to come to money from her and used to kiss 
her shoulders she did not give him the money but 
let herself be kissed her father in tried to rouse 
her jealousy and she replied with a calm smile that 
she was not so stupid as to be  him 
do what he she used to say of me one 
day i asked her if she felt any of pregnancy 
she laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool 
to want to have children and that she was not 
going to have any children by me  then he 
recalled the and of her thoughts and the of the 
expressions that were natural to her though she had been 
brought up in the most   not such a 
fool just you try it on  she used to 
say often seeing the success she had with young and 
old men and women pierre could not understand why he 
did not love her       
  clear out of this    i 
never loved her said he to himself  knew she 
was a woman he repeated  dared not admit it 
to myself and now there dolokhov sitting in the snow 
with a forced smile and perhaps dying while meeting my 
with some forced  pierre was one of those people 
who in spite of an appearance of what is called 
weak character do not a in their he his sufferings 
alone   is all all her he said to 
himself  what of that why did i myself to 
her why did i say  vous  to her 
which was a lie and worse than a lie i 
am guilty and must endure what a on my name 
a for life oh that nonsense he thought  on 
my name and honor all apart from myself   
     i love you   
 xvi was because they said he was and a 
came into pierre head  from their point of they 
were right as were those too who him and died 
a martyr death for his sake then was for being 
a who is right and who is wrong no one 
but if you are tomorrow you die as i might 
have died an hour ago and is it worth when 
one has only a moment of life in with  
but at the moment when he imagined himself by such 
reflections she suddenly came into his mind as she was 
at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his 
love for her and he felt the blood rush to 
his heart and had again to get up and move 
about and break and tear came to his hand  
did i tell her that  vous he kept repeating 
to himself and when he had said it for the 
tenth time words  faire occurred to him and he 
began to laugh at himself      
   what the devil was he doing in 
that  in the night he called his and told 
him to up to go to petersburg he could not 
imagine how he could speak to her now he to 
go away next day and leave a letter her of 
his intention to part from her forever  next morning 
when the came into the room with his pierre was 
lying on the with an open book in his hand 
 he up and looked round for a while with 
a startled expression unable to where he was   
countess told me to whether your excellency was at home 
said the  but before pierre could decide what answer 
he would send the countess herself in a white gown 
embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair  immense 
plaits twice round her lovely head like a entered the 
room calm and except that there was a on her 
rather prominent marble with her calm she did not begin 
to speak in front of the she knew of the 
and had come to speak about it she waited till 
the had set down the things and left the room 
pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles and like 
a by who back her ears and to before her 
he tried to continue reading but feeling this to be 
and impossible he again glanced timidly at her she did 
not sit down but looked at him with a smile 
waiting for the to go   what this now 
what have you been up to now i should like 
to know she asked sternly   what have i 
pierre   it seems you a hero eh come 
now what was this about what is it meant to 
prove what i ask you  pierre turned over heavily 
on the and opened his mouth but could not reply 
  you won answer i tell you helene went 
on  believe everything you told you were told helene 
laughed  dolokhov was my she said in french with 
her coarse plainness of speech uttering the word as as 
any other word  you believed it well what have 
you what does this prove that you a fool vous 
un but everybody knew that what will be the result 
that i shall be the of all moscow that everyone 
will say that you drunk and not knowing what you 
were about a man you are of without cause helene 
raised her voice and became more and more  man 
who a better man than you in every way  
 pierre frowning without looking at her and not moving 
a muscle   how could you believe he was 
my why because i like his company if you were 
and more agreeable i should yours   speak to 
me i beg you muttered pierre   i speak 
i can speak as i like and i tell you 
plainly that there are not many with husbands such as 
you who would not have taken  but i have 
not done so said she  pierre wished to say 
something looked at her with eyes whose strange expression she 
did not understand and lay down again he was suffering 
physically at that moment there was a weight on his 
chest and he could not breathe he knew that he 
must do something to put an end to this suffering 
but what he wanted to do was too terrible  
 had better separate he muttered in a broken voice 
  very well but only if you give me 
a fortune said helene  that a thing to me 
with  pierre up from the sofa and rushed toward 
her   kill you he shouted and the marble 
top of a table with a strength he had never 
before felt he made a step toward her the  
helene face became terrible she and aside his father nature 
showed itself in pierre he felt the fascination and of 
he down the broke it and down on her with 
hands shouted  out in such a terrible voice that 
the whole house heard it with horror god knows what 
he would have done at that moment had helene not 
fled from the room   a week later pierre 
gave his wife full power to control all his estates 
in great russia which formed the larger part of his 
property and left for petersburg alone     
 chapter vii   two months had elapsed since 
the news of the battle of and the of prince 
andrew had reached bald hills and in spite of the 
sent through the and all the made his body had 
not been found nor was he on the list of 
prisoners what was of all for his relations was the 
fact that there was still a of his having been 
picked up on the by the people of the place 
and that he might now be lying or dying alone 
among and unable to send news of himself the from 
which the old prince first heard of the at as 
usual very and that after brilliant the russians had had

understood from this official report that our army had been 
a week after the report of the battle of came 
a letter from kutuzov the prince of the fate that 
had his son   son wrote kutuzov  before 
my eyes a in his hand and at the head 
of a regiment fell as a hero worthy of his 
father and his to the great regret of myself and 
of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he 
is or not i myself and you with the hope 
that your son is for he would have been mentioned 
among the officers found on the field of battle a 
list of whom has been sent me under flag of 
truce  after receiving this news late in the evening 
when he was alone in his study the old prince 
went for his walk as usual next morning but he 
was silent with his the and the and though he 
looked very he said nothing to anyone  when princess 
mary went to him at the usual hour he was 
at his and as usual did not look round at 
her   princess mary he said suddenly in an 
unnatural voice down his  continued to by its own 
and princess mary long remembered the dying creak of that 
which in her memory with what followed  she approached 
him saw his face and something gave way within her 
her eyes grew by the expression of her father face 
not sad not but angry and unnaturally she saw that 
hanging over her and about to crush her was some 
terrible the in life one she had not yet experienced 
and death of one she loved   andrew the 
awkward princess with such an of sorrow and self that 
her father could not bear her look but turned away 
with a sob   news he not among the 
prisoners nor among the killed kutuzov writes and he screamed 
as as if he wished to drive the princess away 
by that   the princess did not fall down 
or faint she was already pale but on hearing these 
words her face changed and something brightened in her beautiful 
radiant eyes it was as if joy joy apart from 
the joys and of this world the great within her 
she forgot all fear of her father went up to 
him took his hand and drawing him down put her 
arm round his thin neck   she said

the old man turning his face away from her  
the army the men and why go go and tell 
lise  the princess into an armchair beside her father 
and wept she saw her brother now as he had 
been at the moment when he took leave of her 
and of lise his look tender yet proud she saw 
him tender and amused as he was when he put 
on the little  he believe had he of his 
was he now there there in the of peace and 
she thought   tell me how it happened she 
asked through her tears   go killed in battle 
where the best of russian men and russia glory were 
led to go princess mary go and tell lise i 
will follow  when princess mary returned from her father 
the little princess sat and looked up with that expression 
of inner happy calm peculiar to pregnant women it was 
evident that her eyes did not see princess mary but 
were looking within into herself at something joyful and taking 
place within her   she said moving away from 
the embroidery frame and lying back  me your hand 
she took her sister hand and held it below her 
 her eyes were smiling her downy lip rose and 
remained lifted in childlike happiness  princess mary down before 
her and hid her face in the folds of her 
sister dress   there do you feel it i

going to love him very much said lise looking with 
bright and happy eyes at her sister  princess mary 
could not lift her head she was weeping

her sister knee  several times in the course of 
the morning princess mary began trying to prepare her sister 
and every time began to cry as was the little 
princess these tears the cause of which she did not 
understand agitated her she said nothing but looked about uneasily 
as if in search of something before dinner the old 
prince of whom she was always afraid came into her 
room with a peculiarly and expression and went out again 
without saying a word she looked at princess mary then 
sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention 
to something within her that is only seen in pregnant 
women and suddenly began to cry   anything come 
from andrew she asked   you know it too 
soon for news but my father is anxious and i 
feel afraid   there nothing   answered princess 
mary looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister 
 she had determined not to tell her and her 
father to hide the terrible news from her till after 
her which was expected within a few days princess mary 
and the old prince each bore and hid their in 
their own way the old prince would not any hope 
he made up his mind that prince andrew had been 
killed and though he sent an official to austria to 
for of his son he ordered a from moscow which 
he intended to erect in his own garden to his 
memory and he told everybody that his son had been 
killed he tried not to change his former way of 
life but his strength failed him he walked less ate 
less less and became every day princess mary she for 
her brother as living and was always awaiting news of 
his return      chapter viii

of the march and her downy little lip rose from 
old habit but as sorrow was in every smile the 
sound of every word and even every in that house 
since the terrible news had come so now the smile 
of the little princess by the general mood though without 
knowing its cause such as to one still more of

the little princess face an expression of childish fear of

so mary say and the little princess began to cry 
like a suffering child and to her little hands even 
with some affectation princess mary ran out of the room 
to mary   dieu mon dieu oh she heard 
as she left the room  the was already on 
her way to meet her rubbing her small plump white 
hands with an air of calm importance   i 
think it beginning said princess mary looking at the with 
wide eyes of alarm   the be thanked princess 
said mary not her steps  young ladies should not

 with lise and prince andrew wishes they had sent 
in good time to moscow for a doctor and were 
expecting him at any moment   matter princess don 
be alarmed said mary  manage very well without a 
doctor  five minutes later princess mary from her room 
heard something heavy being carried by she looked out the 
men were carrying the large sofa from prince andrew study 
into the on their faces was a quiet and solemn 
look  princess mary sat alone in her room listening 
to the sounds in the house now and then opening 
her door when someone passed and watching what was going 
on in the passage some women passing with quiet steps 
in and out of the glanced at the princess and 
turned away she did not to ask any questions and 
the door again now sitting down in her easy chair 
now taking her book now before the stand to her 
surprise and distress she found that her did not calm 
her excitement suddenly her door opened softly and her old 
nurse who hardly ever came to that room as the 
old prince had it appeared on the with a shawl 
round her head   come to sit with you 
a bit said the nurse  here i brought the 
prince candles to light before his saint my she said 
with a sigh   nurse i so glad  
 is  the nurse lit the candles before the 
and sat down by the door with her princess mary 
took a book and began reading only when footsteps or 
voices were heard did they look at one another the 
princess anxious and inquiring the nurse everyone in the house 
was by the same feeling that princess mary experienced as 
she sat in her room but to the that the 
the people who know of it the less a woman 
in everyone tried to not to know no one spoke 
of it but apart from the ordinary and good manners 
habitual in the prince household a common anxiety a of 
the heart and a consciousness that something great and was 
being accomplished at that moment made itself felt  there 
was no laughter in the maids large hall in the 
men hall all sat waiting silently and in the serfs 
and candles were burning and no one the old prince 
on his heels up and down his study and sent 
to ask mary what news only that  prince told 
me to ask and come and tell me her answer 
  the prince that has said mary giving the 
a significant look  went and told the prince  
 good said the prince the door behind him and 
did not hear the slightest sound from the study after 
that  after a while he it as if to 
the candles and seeing the prince was lying on the 
sofa looked at him noticed his face shook his head 
and going up to him silently kissed him on the 
shoulder and left the room without the candles or saying 
why he had entered the most solemn in the world 
continued its course evening passed night came and the feeling 
of and of heart in the presence of the did 
not but no one  it was one of those 
march when winter seems to wish to its and its 
last and with desperate a of horses had been sent 
up the to meet the german doctor from moscow who 
was expected every moment and men on with were sent 
to the to him over the country road with its 
and snow of water  princess mary had long since 
put aside her book she sat silent her eyes fixed 
on her nurse wrinkled face  line of which she 
knew so well on the lock of gray hair that 
from under the and the skin that under her  
nurse in hand was telling in low tones scarcely hearing 
or understanding her own words what she had told of 
times before how the late princess had given to princess 
mary in with only a woman to help instead of 
a   is doctors are never she said  
suddenly a of wind beat against the of the window 
from which the frame had been removed  order of 
the prince one window frame was removed in each room 
as soon as the returned and open a closed set 
the damask and out the with its princess mary her 
nurse putting down the she was went to the window 
and out tried to catch the open the cold wind 
the of her and her locks of gray hair  
 my dear there someone up the she said holding 
the and not it  most likely the doctor  
 my god thank god said princess mary  must 
go and meet him he does not know russian  
princess mary threw a shawl over her head and ran 
to meet the as she was crossing the anteroom she 
saw through the window a carriage with standing at the 
entrance she went out on the stairs on a post 
stood a which in the on the landing below the 
footman stood looking scared and holding another still lower the 
turn of the staircase one could hear the of someone 
in thick felt and a voice that seemed familiar to 
princess mary was saying something   god said the 
voice  father   to bed replied the voice 
of the house who was downstairs  then the voice 
said something more replied and the steps in the felt 
approached the unseen of the staircase more rapidly   
andrew thought princess mary  it can be that would 
be too extraordinary and at the very moment she thought 
this the face and figure of prince andrew in a 
cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow appeared 
on the landing where the footman stood with the yes 
it was he pale thin with a changed and but 
agitated expression on his face he came up the stairs 
and embraced his sister   did not get my 
letter he asked and not waiting for a reply he 
would not have received for the princess was unable to 
speak turned back rapidly the stairs again with the doctor 
who had entered the hall after him  had met 
at the last post and again embraced his sister  
 a strange fate darling and having taken off his 
cloak and felt he went to the little princess  
    chapter ix   the little 
princess lay by with a white cap on her head 
 had just left her of her black hair lay 
round her and her charming rosy mouth with its downy 
lip was open and she was smiling joyfully prince andrew 
entered and paused facing her at the foot of the 
sofa on which she was lying her eyes filled with 
childlike fear and excitement rested on him without changing their 
expression  love you all and have done no to 
anyone why must i suffer so help me her look 
seemed to say she saw her husband but did not 
the of his appearance before her now prince andrew went 
round the sofa and kissed her forehead   darling 
he said word he had never used to her before 
 is  she looked at him inquiringly and with 
childlike reproach   expected help from you and i 
get none none from you either said her eyes she 
was not surprised at his having come she did not 
that he had come his coming had nothing to do 
with her sufferings or with their relief the began again 
and mary prince andrew to leave the room  the 
doctor entered prince andrew went out and meeting princess mary 
again joined her they began talking in but their talk 
broke off at every moment they waited and listened  
 dear said princess mary  prince andrew went again 
to his wife and sat waiting in the room next 
to hers a woman came from the with a frightened 
face and became confused when she saw prince andrew he 
covered his face with his hands and remained so for 
some minutes piteous animal came through the door prince andrew 
got up went to the door and tried to open 
it someone was holding it   can come in 
you can said a terrified voice from within  he 
began pacing the room the ceased and a few more 
went by then suddenly a terrible could not be hers 
she could not like that from the prince andrew ran 
to the door the ceased and he heard the wail 
of an   have they taken a baby in 
there for thought prince andrew in the first second  
baby what baby why is there a baby there or 
is the baby born  then suddenly he realized the 
joyful of that wail tears him and his elbows on 
the window sill be began to cry sobbing like a 
child the door opened the doctor with his shirt sleeves 
tucked up without a coat pale and with a came 
out of the room prince andrew turned to him but 
the doctor gave him a look and passed by without 
a word a woman rushed out and seeing prince andrew 
stopped on the he went into his wife room she 
was lying dead in the same position he had seen 
her in five minutes before and despite the fixed eyes 
and the of the the same expression was on her 
charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny 
black hair   love you all and have done 
no to anyone and what have you done to me 
her charming pathetic dead face  in a corner of 
the room something red and tiny gave a and in 
mary white hands   two hours later prince andrew 
softly went into his father room the old man already 
knew everything he was standing close to the door and 
as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed 
like a round his son neck and without a word 
he began to sob like a child   three 
days later the little princess was and prince andrew went 
up the steps to where the stood to give her 
the kiss and there in the was the same face 
though with closed eyes  what have you done to 
me it still seemed to say and prince andrew felt 
that something gave way in his soul and that he 
was guilty of a sin he could neither nor forget 
he could not the old man too came up and 
kissed the little hands that lay quietly one on the 
other on her breast and to him too her face 
seemed to say  what have you done to me 
and why and at the sight the old man turned 
angrily away   another five days passed and then 
the young prince nicholas was the nurse the with her 
while the with a feather the boy little red and 
wrinkled and  his who was his godfather and afraid 
of dropping him carried the round the and him over 
to the princess mary prince andrew sat in another room 
faint with fear the baby should be drowned in the 
and the of the ceremony he looked up joyfully at 
the baby when the nurse brought it to him and 
nodded approval when she told him that the with the 
baby hair had not in the but had   
   chapter x   rostov in dolokhov 
with bezukhov was hushed up by the of the old 
count and instead of being degraded to the ranks as 
he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the general 
of moscow as a result he could not go to 
the country with the rest of the family but was 
kept all summer in moscow by his new duties dolokhov 
and rostov became very friendly with him during his dolokhov 
lay ill at his mother who loved him passionately and 
tenderly and old mary ivanovna who had grown fond of 
rostov for his friendship to her often talked to him 
about her son   count she would say  
is too noble and for our present world no one 
now it seems like a reproach to everyone now tell 
me count was it right was it honorable of bezukhov 
and with his noble spirit loved him and even now 
never says a word against him those in petersburg when 
they played some on a policeman didn they do it 
together and there bezukhov got off while had to bear 
the whole burden on his shoulders fancy what he had 
to go through it true he has been but how 
could they to do that i think there were not 
many such sons of the out there as he and 
now have these people no feeling or honor knowing him 
to be an only son to challenge him and so 
straight it well god had mercy on us and what 
was it for who doesn have intrigues why if he 
was so as i see things he should have shown 
it sooner but he it go on for months and 
then to call him out on not because he him 
money what what i know you understand my dear count 
that believe me is why i am so fond of 
you few people do understand him he is such a 
lofty heavenly soul  dolokhov himself during his spoke to 
rostov in a way no one would have expected of 
him   know people consider me a bad man 
he said  them i don care a straw about 
anyone but those i love but those i love i 
love so that i would give my life for them 
and the others i if they stood in my way 
i have an adored a priceless mother and two or 
three friends among them as for the rest i only 
care about them in so far as they are or 
and most of them are especially the women yes dear 
boy he continued  have met noble high men but 
i have not yet met any women or were not 
i have not yet met that and devotion i look 
for in women if i found such a one i 
give my life for her but those and he made 
a gesture of  believe me if i still value 
my life it is only because i still hope to 
meet such a creature who will and me but you 
don understand it   yes i quite understand answered 
rostov who was under his new friend influence  in 
the the rostovs returned to moscow early in the winter 
also came back and stayed with them the first half 
of the winter of  which nicholas rostov spent in 
moscow was one of the times for him and the 
whole family nicholas brought many young men to his parents 
house vera was a handsome girl of twenty sonya a 
girl of sixteen with all the of an opening flower 
natasha half grown up and half child was now amusing 
now enchanting  at that time in the rostovs house 
there an of where there are very young and very 
charming girls every young man who came to the house 
those smiling young faces  probably at their own happiness 
feeling the eager around him and hearing the of song 
and music and the but friendly of young girls ready 
for anything and full of hope the same feeling sharing 
with the young of the rostovs household a to fall 
in love and an of happiness  among the young 
men introduced by rostov one of the first was dolokhov 
whom everyone in the house liked except natasha she almost 
with her brother about him she that he was a 
bad man and that in the with bezukhov pierre was 
right and dolokhov wrong and further that he was disagreeable 
and unnatural   nothing for me to understand she 
cried out with resolute self  is wicked and heartless 
there now i like your though he is a and 
all that still i like him so you see i 
do understand i don know how to put it with 
this one everything is and i don like that but 
  is quite different replied nicholas that even was 
nothing to dolokhov must understand what a soul there is 
in dolokhov you should see him with his mother what 
a heart   i don know about that but 
i am uncomfortable with him and do you know he 
has in love with sonya   nonsense   
certain of it you see  natasha true dolokhov who 
did not usually care for the society of ladies began 
to come often to the house and the question for 
whose sake he came  no one spoke of it 
was soon settled he came because of sonya and sonya 
though she would never have dared to say so knew 
it and blushed scarlet every time dolokhov appeared  dolokhov 
often at the rostovs never a at which they were 
present and went to balls for young people which the 
rostovs always attended he was attentive to sonya and looked 
at her in such a way that not only could 
she not bear his glances without but even the old 
countess and natasha blushed when they saw his looks  
it was evident that this strange strong man was under 
the influence of the dark graceful girl who loved another 
 rostov noticed something new in dolokhov relations with sonya 
but he did not explain to himself what these new 
relations were  always in love with someone he thought 
of sonya and natasha but he was not as much 
at ease with sonya and dolokhov as before and was 
less frequently at home  in the of  everybody 
had again talking of the war with napoleon with even 
greater than the year before orders were given to ten 
men in every thousand for the regular army and besides 
this nine men in every thousand for the everywhere bonaparte 
was and in moscow nothing but the coming war was 
talked of for the rostov family the whole interest of 
these for war lay in the fact that nicholas would 
not hear of remaining in moscow and only the of 
after to return with him to their regiment his approaching 
did not prevent his amusing himself but rather gave to 
his he spent the greater part of his time away 
from home at parties and balls     
 chapter xi   on the third day after 
nicholas at home a thing he had done of late 
it was a grand dinner as he and were leaving 
to join their regiment after about twenty people were present 
including dolokhov and  never had love been so much 
in the air and never had the made itself so 
strongly felt in the rostovs house as at this time 
 the moments of happiness love and be loved that 
is the only in the world all else is folly 
it is the one thing we are interested in here 
said the spirit of the place  nicholas having as 
usual exhausted two of horses without visiting all the places 
he meant to go to and where he had been 
returned home just before dinner as soon as he entered 
he noticed and felt the of the air in the 
house and also noticed a embarrassment among some of those 
present sonya dolokhov and the old countess were especially disturbed 
and to a degree natasha nicholas understood that something must 
have happened between sonya and dolokhov before dinner and with 
the kindly natural to him was very gentle and with 
them both at dinner on that same evening there was 
to be one of the balls that  dancing gave 
for his during the   will you come to 
please do said natasha  asked you and vasili  
is also going        
   would i not go at the countess 
command said who at the rostovs had assumed the role 
of natasha  even to dance the de   
i have time answered nicholas  i promised the arkharovs 
they have a party   you he asked dolokhov 
but as soon as he had asked the question he 
noticed that it should not have been put   
coldly and angrily replied dolokhov glancing at sonya and scowling 
he gave nicholas just such a look as he had 
given pierre at the club dinner   is something 
up thought nicholas and he was further in this by 
the fact that dolokhov left immediately after dinner he called 
natasha and asked her what was the matter   
i was looking for you said natasha running out to 
him  told you but you would not believe it 
she said  has to sonya  little as nicholas 
had occupied himself with sonya of late something seemed to 
give way within him at this news dolokhov was a 
and in some a brilliant match for the girl from 
the point of of the old countess and of society 
it was out of the question for her to refuse 
him and therefore nicholas first feeling on hearing the news 
was one of anger with sonya he tried to say 
 capital of course she forget her childish promises and 
accept the but before he had time to say it 
natasha began again   fancy she refused him quite 
adding after a pause  told him she loved another 
  my sonya could not have done thought nicholas 
  as mamma pressed her she refused and i 
know she won change once she has said   
mamma pressed her said nicholas   said natasha  
you know nicholas be angry i know you will not 
marry her i know heaven knows how but i know 
for certain that you won marry her   you 
don know that at all said nicholas  i must 
talk to her what a darling sonya is he added 
with a smile   she is indeed a darling 
i send her to you  and natasha kissed her 
brother and ran away  a minute later sonya came 
in with a frightened guilty and scared look nicholas went 
up to her and kissed her hand this was the 
first time since his return that they had talked alone 
and about their love   he began timidly at 
first and then more and more boldly  you wish 
to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and 
advantageous match but a splendid noble fellow he is my 
friend  sonya interrupted him   have already refused 
she said hurriedly   you are for my sake 
i am afraid that i  sonya again interrupted she 
gave him an frightened look   don tell me 
that she said   but i must it may 
be of me but still it is best to say 
it if you refuse him on my account i must 
tell you the whole truth i love you and i 
think i love you more than anyone else   
is enough for me said sonya blushing   but 
i have been in love a thousand times and shall 
fall in love again though for no one have i 
such a feeling of friendship confidence and love as i 
have for you then i am young mamma does not 
wish it in a word i make no promise and 
i beg you to consider dolokhov he said his friend 
name with difficulty   say that to me i 
want nothing i love you as a brother and always 
shall and i want nothing more   are an 
i am not worthy of you but i am afraid 
of you  and nicholas again kissed her hand  
    chapter xii   were the 
most balls in moscow so said the mothers as they 
watched their young people executing their newly learned steps and 
so said the and themselves as they danced till they 
were ready to drop and so said the grown young 
men and women who came to these balls with an 
air of condescension and found them most that year two 
had come of these balls the two pretty young princesses 
met there and were married and so further the of 
these what distinguished them from others was the of host 
or hostess and the presence of the good flying about 
like a feather and to the of his art as 
he the from all his visitors there was the fact 
that only those came who wished to dance and themselves 
as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing 
long dresses for the first time with scarcely any they 
all were or seemed to be pretty rapturous were their 
smiles and so sparkling their eyes sometimes the best of 
the of whom natasha who was graceful was first even 
danced the de but at this last ball only the 
the and the which was just coming into fashion were 
danced had taken a ballroom in bezukhov house and the 
ball as everyone said was a great success there were 
many pretty girls and the rostov girls were among the 
they were both particularly happy and gay that evening proud 
of dolokhov her and her with nicholas sonya about before 
she left home so that the maid could hardly get 
her hair and she was radiant with impulsive joy  
natasha no less proud of her first long dress and 
of being at a real ball was even happier they 
were both dressed in white muslin with pink ribbons  
natasha fell in love the very moment she entered the 
ballroom she was not in love with anyone in particular 
but with everyone person she happened to look at she 
was in love with for that moment   how 
delightful it is she kept saying running up to sonya 
 nicholas and were up and down looking with kindly 
at the   sweet she is will be a 
beauty said     natasha answered   
how she what he said again after a pause  
 are you talking about   your sister  
rostov smiled   dear count you were one of 
my best must dance said little coming up to nicholas 
 how many charming young ladies he turned with the 
same request to who was also a former of his 
  my dear fellow i be a said  
you what bad use i made of your lessons  
 no said to reassure him  were only but 
you had talent yes you had talent   the 
band struck up the newly introduced nicholas could not refuse 
and asked sonya to dance sat down by the old 
ladies and on his saber and time with his foot 
told them something funny and kept them amused while he 
watched the young people dancing with natasha his pride and 
his best were the first with his little feet in 
low shoes first across the hall with natasha who though 
shy went on carefully executing her steps did not take 
his eyes off her and beat time with his saber 
in a way that clearly indicated that if he was 
not dancing it was because he would not and not 
because he could not in the middle of a figure 
he to rostov who was passing   is not 
at all the thing he said  sort of is 
this but she does dance splendidly  knowing that had 
a reputation even in for the way in which he 
danced the nicholas ran up to natasha   and 
choose he is a real a wonder he said  
when it came to natasha turn to choose a partner 
she rose and tripping rapidly across in her little shoes 
trimmed with bows ran timidly to the corner where sat 
she saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting 
nicholas saw that was though he smiled he ran up 
to them   vasili natasha was saying  come 
  no let me off countess replied   
then said nicholas   me as if i were 
the cat said   sing for you a whole 
evening said natasha   the she can do anything 
with me said and he his saber he came out 
from behind the chairs clasped his partner hand firmly threw 
back his head and his foot waiting for the beat 
only on horse back and in the was short not 
and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to 
be at the right beat of the music he looked 
sideways at his partner with a merry and air suddenly 
stamped with one foot from the floor like a ball 
and round the room taking his partner with him he 
silently on one foot half across the room and not 
to notice the chairs was straight at them when suddenly 
his spurs and spreading out his legs he stopped short 
on his heels stood so a second stamped on the 
spot his spurs rapidly round and striking his left against 
his right round again in a circle natasha guessed what 
he meant to do and herself to him followed his 
lead hardly knowing how first he her round holding her 
now with his left now with his right hand then 
falling on one knee he her round him and again 
up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if 
he would rush through the whole of rooms without drawing 
and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and 
steps when at last his partner round in front of 
her chair he drew up with a of his spurs 
and bowed to her natasha did not even make him 
a she fixed her eyes on him in amazement smiling 
as if she did not recognize him   does 
this mean she brought out  although did not this 
to be the real everyone was delighted with he was 
asked again and again as a partner and the old 
men began smilingly to talk about and the good old 
days flushed after the and himself with his handkerchief sat 
down by natasha and did not leave her for the 
rest of the evening      chapter 
xiii   for two days after that rostov did 
not see dolokhov at his own or at dolokhov home 
on the third day he received a note from him 
  as i do not to be at your 
house again for reasons you know of and am going 
to my regiment i am giving a supper tonight to 
my friends to the english   about ten o 
rostov went to the english straight from the where he 
had been with his family and he was at once 
shown to the best room which dolokhov had taken for 
that evening some twenty men were gathered round a table 
at which dolokhov sat between two candles on the table 
was a of gold and paper money and he was 
keeping the bank rostov had not seen him since his 
and sonya and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how 
they would meet  dolokhov clear cold glance met rostov 
as soon as he entered the door as though he 
had long expected him   a long time since 
we met he said  for coming i just finish 
and then will come with his   called once 
or twice at your house said rostov  dolokhov made 
no reply   may he said  rostov recalled 
at that moment a strange conversation he had once had 
with dolokhov  but fools to luck in play dolokhov 
had then said   are you afraid to play 
with me dolokhov now asked as if rostov thought  
beneath his smile rostov saw in him the mood he 
had shown at the club dinner and at other times 
when as if tired of life he had felt a 
need to escape from it by some strange and usually 
cruel  rostov felt ill at ease he tried but 
failed to find some joke with which to reply to 
dolokhov words but before he had thought of anything dolokhov 
looking straight in his face said slowly and deliberately so 
that everyone could hear   you remember we had 
a talk about cards  a fool who to luck 
one should make certain and i want to try  
 try his luck or the rostov asked himself  
 you better not play dolokhov added and a new 
of cards said  gentlemen  moving the money forward 
he prepared to deal rostov sat down by his side 
and at first did not play dolokhov kept glancing at 
him   don you play he asked  and 
strange to say nicholas felt that he could not help 
taking up a card putting a small stake on it 
and beginning to play   have no money with 
me he said   you  rostov five rubles 
on a card and lost again and again lost dolokhov 
 that is beat ten cards of rostov running  
 said dolokhov after he had for some time  
place your money on the cards or i may get 
in the  one of the said he he might 
be   you might but i am afraid of 
getting the accounts mixed so i ask you to put 
the money on your cards replied dolokhov  yourself we 
afterwards he added turning to rostov  the game continued 
a kept round champagne  all rostov cards were and 
he had eight hundred rubles up against him he wrote 
 rubles on a card but while the filled his 
glass he changed his mind and altered it to his 
usual stake of twenty rubles   it said dolokhov 
though he did not seem to be even looking at 
rostov  it back all the sooner i lose to 
the others but from you or are you afraid of 
me he asked again  rostov he let the eight 
hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts with 
a corner which he had picked up from the floor 
he well remembered that seven afterwards he laid down the 
seven of hearts on which with a broken bit of 
he had written  rubles in clear upright he the 
glass of warm champagne that was him smiled at dolokhov 
words and with a heart waiting for a seven to 
turn up gazed at dolokhov hands which held the much 
on rostov winning or losing on that seven of hearts 
on the previous the old count had given his son 
two thousand rubles and though he always speaking of money 
difficulties had told nicholas that this was all he could 
let him have till may and asked him to be 
more this time nicholas had replied that it would be 
more than enough for him and that he gave his 
word of honor not to take anything more till the 
spring now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that 
money so that this seven of hearts meant for him 
not only the of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity 
of going back on his word with a heart he 
watched dolokhov hands and thought  then make and let 
me have this card and i take my cap and 
drive home to supper with natasha and sonya and will 
certainly never touch a card again at that moment his 
home life with petya with sonya with natasha with his 
father and even his comfortable bed in the house on 
the povarskaya rose before him with such and that it 
seemed as if it were all a lost and long 
past he could not that a stupid letting the seven 
be to the right rather than to the left might 
deprive him of all this happiness newly appreciated and newly 
and him into the of and that could not be 
yet he with a heart the movement of dolokhov hands 
those broad hands with visible from under the shirt cuffs 
laid down the and took up a glass and a 
pipe that were him   you are not afraid 
to play with me repeated dolokhov and as if about 
to tell a good story he put down the cards 
leaned back in his chair and began deliberately with a 
smile   gentlemen i been told there a going 
about moscow that i a so i advise you to 
be   now deal exclaimed rostov   those 
moscow said dolokhov and he took up the cards with 
a smile   rostov almost screamed lifting both hands 
to his head the seven he was lying the first 
card in the he had lost more than he could 
pay   don yourself said dolokhov with a side 
glance at rostov as he continued to deal   
   chapter xiv   an hour and 
a half later most of the were but little interested 
in their own play  the whole interest was concentrated 
on rostov instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a 
long of against him which he had up to ten 
thousand but that now as he must have to fifteen 
thousand in it already twenty thousand rubles dolokhov was no 
longer listening to stories or telling them but followed every 
movement of rostov hands and occasionally ran his eyes over 
the score against him he had decided to play until 
that score reached forty thousand he had fixed on that 
number because forty was the sum of his and sonya 
joint rostov his head on both hands sat at the 
table which was over with with wine and with cards 
one did not leave him that those broad hands with 
visible from under the shirt sleeves those hands which he 
loved and held him in their power   hundred 
rubles a corner a nine winning it back impossible oh 
how pleasant it was at home the or it can 
be and why is he doing this to me rostov 
pondered sometimes he a large sum but dolokhov refused to 
accept it and fixed the stake himself nicholas to him 
and at one moment to god as he had done 
on the at the bridge over the and then guessed 
that the card that came first to hand from the 
under the table would save him now counted the on 
his coat and took a card with that number and 
tried the of his on it then he looked round 
for from the other or peered at the now cold 
face of dolokhov and tried to read what was passing 
in his mind   knows of course what this 
means to me he can want my he my friend 
i fond of him but it not his what he 
to do if he has such luck and it not 
my either he thought to himself  have done nothing 
wrong have i killed anyone or or wished to anyone 
why such a terrible and when did it begin such 
a little while ago i came to this table with 
the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that 
for mamma name day and then going home i was 
so happy so free so and i did not how 
happy i was when did that end and when did 
this new terrible state of things begin what the change 
i sat all the time in this same place at 
this table chose and placed cards and watched those broad 
hands in the same way when did it happen and 
what has happened i am well and strong and still 
the same and in the same place no it can 
be it will all end in nothing  he was 
flushed and in though the room was not hot his 
face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its 
to seem calm  the score against him reached the 
sum of forty thousand rostov had just prepared a card 
by bending the corner of which he meant to the 
three thousand just put down to his score when dolokhov 
down the of cards put it aside and began rapidly 
adding up the of rostov breaking the as he the 
in his clear bold hand   it time for 
supper and here are the  some men and women 
were really entering from the cold outside and saying something 
in their nicholas understood that it was all over but 
he said in an indifferent tone   won you 
go on i had a splendid card all ready as 
if it were the fun of the game which interested 
him most   all up i lost thought he 
 a through my all that left me and at 
the same time he said in a cheerful voice  
 now just this one more little card   
right said dolokhov having finished the addition  right twenty 
rubles he said pointing to the figure twenty by which 
the the round sum of forty thousand and taking up 
a he prepared to deal rostov the corner of his 
card and instead of the six thousand he had intended 
carefully wrote twenty   all the same to me 
he said  only want to see whether you will 
let me this ten or beat it  dolokhov began 
to deal seriously oh how rostov at that moment those 
hands with their short fingers and which held him in 
their power the ten fell to him   forty 
thousand count said dolokhov and himself he rose from the 
table  does get tired sitting so long he added 
  i tired too said rostov  dolokhov cut 
him short as if to him that it was not 
for him to   am i to receive the 
money count  rostov flushing drew dolokhov into the next 
room   cannot pay it all immediately will you 
take an i he said   say rostov said 
dolokhov clearly smiling and looking nicholas straight in the eyes 
 know the saying  in love at cards your 
cousin is in love with you i know   
it terrible to feel so in this man power thought 
rostov he knew what a he would on his father 
and mother by the news of this he knew what 
a relief it would be to escape it all and 
felt that dolokhov knew that he could save him from 
all this shame and sorrow but wanted now to play 
with him as a cat does with a   
cousin dolokhov started to say but nicholas interrupted him  
 cousin has nothing to do with this and it 
not necessary to mention her he exclaimed   when 
am i to have it   replied rostov and 
left the room      chapter xv 
  to say  and keep up a dignified 
tone was not difficult but to go home alone see 
his sisters brother mother and father confess and ask for 
money he had no right to after giving his word 
of honor was terrible  at home they had not 
yet gone to bed the young people after returning from 
the had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord 
as soon as nicholas entered he was in that of 
love which the rostov household that winter and now after 
dolokhov and ball seemed to have grown round sonya and 
natasha as the air does before a sonya and natasha 
in the light dresses they had worn at the looking 
pretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord 
happy and smiling vera was playing with shinshin in the 
drawing room the old countess waiting for the return of 
her husband and son sat playing patience with the old 
who lived in their house with sparkling eyes and hair 
sat at the clavichord striking with his short fingers his 
legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang 
with his small but true voice some verses called  
which he had and to which he was trying to 
fit music     say to my  
  what power is this me still   
 what has set my soul on fire   
 what is this that makes my fingers  he 
was in passionate tones gazing with his sparkling black eyes 
at the frightened and happy natasha   excellent exclaimed 
natasha  she said without noticing nicholas   still 
the same with them thought nicholas glancing into the drawing 
room where he saw vera and his mother with the 
old lady   and here nicholas cried natasha running 
up to him   papa at home he asked 
  am so glad you come said natasha without 
answering him  are ourselves vasili is staying a day 
longer for my sake did you know   papa 
is not back yet said sonya   have you 
come come here dear called the old countess from the 
drawing room  nicholas went to her kissed her hand 
and sitting down silently at her table began to watch 
her hands arranging the cards from the dancing room they 
still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to natasha 
to sing   all shouted  no good making 
now it your turn to sing the you  the 
countess glanced at her silent son   is the 
matter she asked   nothing said he as if 
weary of being continually asked the same question  papa 
be back soon   expect so   the 
same with them they know nothing about it where am 
i to go thought nicholas and went again into the 
dancing room where the clavichord stood  sonya was sitting 
at the clavichord playing the prelude to favorite natasha was 
preparing to sing was looking at her with enraptured eyes 
 nicholas began pacing up and down the room  
 do they want to make her sing how can 
she sing there nothing to be happy about thought he 
 sonya struck the first of the prelude   
god i a and man a through my is the 
only thing left me his thoughts ran on  away 
but where to it one them sing  he continued 
to the room looking at and the girls and their 
eyes   what is the matter sonya eyes fixed 
on him seemed to ask she noticed at once that 
something had happened to him  nicholas turned away from 
her natasha too with her quick had instantly noticed her 
brother condition but though she noticed it she was herself 
in such high at that moment so far from sorrow 
sadness or self that she herself as young people often 
do  i am too happy now to spoil my 
enjoyment by sympathy with anyone sorrow she felt and she 
said to herself  i must be mistaken he must 
be feeling happy just as i am   sonya 
she said going to the very middle of the room 
where she considered the was best  having lifted her 
head and let her arms as do natasha rising from 
her heels to her stepped to the middle of the 
room and stood still   that me she seemed 
to say answering the with which followed her   
what is she so pleased about thought nicholas looking at 
his sister  isn she dull and ashamed  natasha 
took the first note her her chest rose her eyes 
became serious at that moment she was oblivious of her 
and from her smiling lips sounds which anyone may produce 
at the same and hold for the same time but 
which leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand 
and first time you and make you  natasha that 
winter had for the first time to sing seriously because 
so delighted in her she no longer sang as a 
child there was no longer in her that childish effect 
that had been in it before but she did not 
yet sing well as all the who heard her said 
 is not but it is a beautiful voice that 
must be only they generally said this some time after 
she had finished while that voice with its breathing and 
was even the said nothing but only delighted in it 
and wished to hear it again in her voice there 
was a an of her own and an as yet 
softness which so mingled with her lack of art in 
that it seemed as if nothing in that voice could 
be altered without spoiling it   is this thought 
nicholas listening to her with widely opened eyes  has 
happened to her how she is today and suddenly the 
whole world for him on of the next note the 
next phrase and everything in the world was divided into 
three  one two three one two three one  
one two three one  this life of ours thought 
nicholas  this and money and dolokhov and anger and 
honor all nonsense but this is real now then natasha 
now then now then darling how will she take that 
she taken it thank god and without noticing that he 
was to the he a second a third below the 
high note  god how fine did i really take 
it how he thought  oh how that and how 
moved was something that was in rostov soul and this 
something was apart from everything else in the world and 
above everything in the world  were and dolokhov and 
words of honor all nonsense one might kill and and 
yet be happy      chapter xvi 
  it was long since rostov had felt such 
enjoyment from music as he did that day but no 
sooner had natasha finished her than again itself he got 
up without saying a word and went downstairs to his 
own room a of an hour later the old count 
came in from his club cheerful and nicholas hearing him 
drive up went to meet him   a good 
time said the old count smiling gaily and at his 
son  nicholas tried to say  but could not 
and he nearly burst into the count was his pipe 
and did not notice his son condition   it 
can be thought nicholas for the first and last time 
and suddenly in the most tone which made him feel 
ashamed of himself he said as if merely asking his 
father to let him have the carriage to drive to 
town   i have come on a matter of 
business i was nearly forgetting i need some money  
 me said his father who was in a specially 
good  told you it would not be enough how 
much   much said nicholas flushing and with a 
stupid careless smile for which he was long unable to 
forgive himself  have lost a little i mean a 
good deal a great deal three thousand   to 
whom nonsense cried the count suddenly with an over neck 
and as old people do   promised to pay 
tomorrow said nicholas   said the old count spreading 
out his arms and on the sofa   can 
be helped it happens to everyone said the son with 
a bold free and easy tone while in his soul 
he regarded himself as a whose whole life could not 
for his he to kiss his father hands and to 
beg his forgiveness but said in a careless and even 
voice that it happens to everyone  the old count 
down his eyes on hearing his son words and began 
searching for something   yes he muttered  will 
be difficult i fear difficult to happens to everybody yes 
who has not done it  and with a glance 
at his son face the count went out of the 
room nicholas had been prepared for but had not at 
all expected this   he called after him sobbing 
 me and his father hand he pressed it to 
his lips and burst into tears  while father and 
son were having their the mother and daughter were having 
one not less important natasha came running to her mother 
quite   mamma he has made me   
what   made me an mamma mamma she exclaimed 
 the countess did not believe her ears had to 
whom to this of a girl natasha who not so 
long ago was playing with and who was still having 
lessons   natasha what nonsense she said it was 
a joke   indeed i am telling you the 
fact said natasha  come to ask you what to 
do and you call it   the countess shrugged 
her shoulders   it is true that monsieur has 
made you a tell him he is a fool that 
all   he not a fool replied natasha and 
seriously   then what do you want you all 
in love well if you are in love marry him 
said the countess with a laugh of annoyance  luck 
to you   mamma i not in love with 
him i suppose i not in love with him  
 then tell him so   are you cross 
don be cross dear is it my   but 
what is it my dear do you want me to 
go and tell him said the countess smiling   
i will do it myself only tell me what to

a smile  should have seen how he said it 
i know he did not mean to say it but 
it came out   all the same you must 
refuse him   i i am so sorry for 
him he so nice   then accept his it 
high time for you to be married answered the countess 
and   mamma but i so sorry for him 
i don know how i to say it   
there nothing for you to say i shall speak to 
him myself said the countess that they should have dared 
to treat this little natasha as grown up   
not on any account i will tell him myself and 
you listen at the door and natasha ran across the 
drawing room to the dancing hall where was sitting on 
the same chair by the clavichord with his face in 
his hands  he jumped up at the sound of 
her light step   he said moving with steps 
toward her  my fate it is in your hands 
  i so sorry for you no but you 
are so nice but it won do that but as 
a friend i shall always love you  bent over 
her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not 
understand she kissed his rough curly black head at this 
instant they heard the quick rustle of the countess dress 
she came up to them   i thank you 
for the honor she said with an voice though it 
sounded severe to my daughter is so young and i 
thought that as my son friend you would have addressed 
yourself first to me in that case you would not 
have me to give this   said with eyes 
and a guilty face he tried to say more but 
faltered  natasha could not remain calm seeing him in 
such a she began to sob aloud   i 
have done went on in an voice  believe me 
i so your daughter and all your family that i 
would give my life twice over he looked at the 
countess and seeing her severe face said  good countess 
and kissing her hand he left the room with quick 
resolute without looking at natasha   next day rostov 
saw off he did not wish to stay another day 
in moscow all moscow friends gave him a entertainment at 
the with the result that he had no of how 
he was put in the or of the first three 
of his  after rostov spent another in moscow without 
going out of the house waiting for the money his 
father could not at once and he spent most of 
his time in the girls room  sonya was more 
tender and devoted to him than ever it was as 
if she wanted to show him that his were an 
that made her love him all the more but nicholas 
now considered himself of her  he filled the girls 
with verses and music and having at last sent dolokhov 
the whole forty thousand rubles and received his he left 
at the end of without taking leave of any of 
his to his regiment which was already in   
   book five      
   chapter i   after his interview 
with his wife pierre left for petersburg at the post 
either there were no horses or the would not supply 
them pierre was to wait without he lay down on 
the sofa in front of a round table put his 
big feet in their on the table and began to 
  you have the brought in and a bed 
got ready and tea asked his  pierre gave no 
answer for he neither heard nor saw anything he had 
to think of the last and was still on the 
same question so important that he took no notice of 
what went on around him not only was he indifferent 
as to whether he got to petersburg earlier or later 
or whether he at this but to the thoughts that 
now occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether 
he remained there for a few hours or for the 
rest of his life  the his wife the and 
a woman embroidery came into the room their without changing 
his careless attitude pierre looked at them over his spectacles 
unable to understand what they wanted or how they could 
go on living without having solved the that so him 
he had been by the same thoughts ever since the 
day he returned from after the and had spent that 
first night but now in the of the they seized 
him with special force no matter what he thought about 
he always returned to these same questions which he could 
not solve and yet could not to ask himself it 
was as if the of the chief which held his 
life together were so that the could not get in 
or out but went on turning in the same place 
 the came in and began to beg his excellency 
to wait only two hours when come what might he 
would let his excellency have the courier horses it was 
plain that he was lying and only wanted to get 
more money from the   this good or bad 
pierre asked himself  is good for me bad for 
another and for himself it because he money for food 
the man said an officer had once given him a 
for letting a private have the courier horses but the 
officer him because he had to get on as quickly 
as possible and i continued pierre  dolokhov because i 
considered myself and louis xvi was because they considered him 
a and a year later they those who him for 
some reason what is bad what is good what should 
one love and what hate what does one live for 
and what am i what is life and what is 
death what power all  there was no answer to 
any of these questions except one and that not a 
answer and not at all a reply to them the 
answer was  die and all will end you die 
and know all or asking but dying was also dreadful 
 the woman in a voice went on her especially 
a pair of slippers  have of rubles i don 
know what to do with and she in her tattered 
cloak looking timidly at me he thought  what does 
she want the money for as if that money could 
add a hair to happiness or peace of mind can 
anything in the world make her or me less a 
to and death which all and must come today or 
tomorrow any rate in an instant as with and again 
he the with the and again it turned in the 
same place  his him a half in the form 
of by madame de he began reading about the sufferings 
and virtuous of a certain de  why did she 
her when she loved him he thought  could not 
have put into her heart an impulse that was against 
his will my wife she once was not and perhaps 
she was right nothing has been found out nothing discovered 
pierre again said to himself  we can know is 
that we know nothing and that the height of human 
 everything within and around him seemed confused and yet 
in this very to all his circumstances pierre found a 
kind of satisfaction   make bold to ask your 
excellency to move a little for this said the entering 
the room followed by another also detained for lack of 
horses  the was a short large wrinkled old man 
with gray eyebrows bright eyes of an color  pierre 
took his feet off the table stood up and lay 
down on a bed that had been got ready for 
him glancing now and then at the who with a 
gloomy and tired face was taking off his with the 
of his and not looking at pierre with a pair 
of felt on his thin bony legs and keeping on 
a worn coat the sat down on the sofa leaned 
back his big head with its broad and close hair 
and looked at bezukhov the stern and expression of that 
look struck pierre he felt a wish to speak to 
the stranger but by the time he had made up 
his mind to ask him a question about the the 
had closed his eyes his old hands were and on 
the finger of one of them pierre noticed a large 
iron ring with a a death head the stranger sat 
without stirring either resting or as it seemed to pierre 
in profound and calm meditation his was also a wrinkled 
old man without or mustache evidently not because he was 
but because they had never grown this active old was 
the and preparing tea he brought in a samovar when 
everything was ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to 
the table filled a tumbler with tea for himself and 
one for the old man to whom he passed it 
pierre began to feel a sense of and the need 
even the of entering into conversation with this stranger  
the brought back his tumbler turned down  with an 
bit of and asked if anything more would be wanted 
       to indicate he 
did not want more tea    give me 
the book said the stranger  the him a book 
which pierre took to be a work and the became 
in it pierre looked at him all at once the 
stranger closed the book putting in a and again with 
his arms on the back of the sofa sat in 
his former position with his eyes pierre looked at him 
and had not time to turn away when the old 
man opening his eyes fixed his steady and severe straight 
on pierre face  pierre felt confused and wished to 
avoid that look but the bright old eyes him  
    chapter ii    have 
the pleasure of addressing count bezukhov if i am not 
mistaken said the stranger in a and loud voice  
pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles 
  have heard of you my dear sir continued 
the stranger  of your he seemed to the last 
word as if to say call it what you please 
i know that what happened to you in moscow was 
a regret it very much my dear sir  pierre 
flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed 
bent forward toward the old man with a forced and 
timid smile   have not to this out of 
curiosity my dear sir but for greater reasons  he 
paused his still on pierre and moved aside on the 
sofa by way of inviting the other to take a 
seat beside him pierre felt to enter into conversation with 
this old man but to him came up and sat 
down beside him   are unhappy my dear sir 
the stranger continued  are young and i am old 
i should like to help you as far as lies 
in my power   yes said pierre with a 
forced smile  am very grateful to you where are 
you from  the stranger face was not it was 
even cold and severe but in spite of this both 
the face and words of his new acquaintance were attractive 
to pierre   if for reason you don feel 
inclined to talk to me said the old man  
so my dear sir and he suddenly smiled in an 
and tenderly way   no not at all on 
the contrary i am very glad to make your acquaintance 
said pierre and again glancing at the stranger hands he 
looked more at the ring with its skull sign  
 me to ask he said  you a  
 i belong to the of the said the stranger 
looking deeper and deeper into pierre eyes  in their 
name and my own i hold out a hand to 
you   am afraid said pierre smiling and between 
the confidence the of the freemason inspired in him and 
his own habit of the am afraid i am very 
far from understanding am i to put it am afraid 
my way of looking at the world is so to 
yours that we shall not understand one another   
know your said the  the of life you mention 
and which you think is the result of your own 
mental is the one held by the of people and 
is the fruit of pride and forgive me my dear 
sir but if i had not known it i should 
not have addressed you your of life is a  
 as i may suppose you to be said pierre 
with a faint smile   should never to say 
that i know the truth said the whose words struck 
pierre more and more by their precision and  one 
can to truth by himself only by laying stone on 
stone with the of all by the millions of from 
our to our own times is that which is to 
be a worthy place of the great god he added 
and closed his eyes   ought to tell you 
that i do not believe do not believe in god 
said pierre and with an effort feeling it essential to 
speak the whole truth  the looked at pierre and 
smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might 
smile at a poor fellow who told him that he 
poor man had not the five rubles that would make 
him happy   you do not know him my 
dear sir said the  cannot know him you do 
not know him and that is why you are unhappy 
  yes i am unhappy pierre  what am 
i to do   know him not my dear 
sir and so you are very unhappy you do not 
know him but he is here he is in me 
he is in my words he is in thee and 
even in those words just uttered the in a stern 
and voice  he paused and evidently trying to calm 
himself   he were not he said quietly  
and i would not be speaking of him my dear 
sir of what of whom are we speaking whom he 
suddenly asked with and in his voice  him if 
he did not exist came of the of such an 
being and why did the whole world the idea of 
the of such an being a being all and in 
all his  he stopped and remained silent for a 
long time  pierre could not and did not wish 
to break this silence   but to understand him 
is hard the began again looking not at pierre but 
straight before him and turning the leaves of his book 
with his old hands which from excitement he could not 
keep still  it were a man whose doubt i 
could bring him to thee could take him by the 
hand and show him to thee but how can i 
an insignificant show his his and all his mercy to 
one who is or who his eyes that he may 
not see or understand him and may not see or 
understand his own and he paused again  art that 
art because utter those words he went on with a 
and smile  art more foolish and than a little 
child who playing with the of a made watch to 
say that as he does not understand its use he 
does not believe in the who made it to know 
him is hard for from our to our own day 
we to that knowledge and are still far from our 
aim but in our lack of understanding we see only 
our weakness and his greatness  pierre listened with heart 
gazing into the face with shining eyes not interrupting or 
him but with his whole soul what the stranger said 
whether he the in the words or believed as a 
child in the speaker tone of conviction and or the 
of the speaker voice sometimes almost broke those brilliant aged 
eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm and 
of his vocation which from his whole being  which 
struck pierre especially by contrast with his own and any 
rate pierre with his whole soul to believe and he 
did believe and felt a joyful sense of and return 
to life   is not to be by reason 
but by life said the   do not understand 
said pierre feeling with dismay he was afraid of any 
want of any weakness in the he not to be 
able to believe in him  don understand he said 
 it is that the mind of man cannot the 
knowledge of which you speak  the smiled with his 
gentle smile   highest and truth are like the 
we may wish to he said  i receive that 
into an and judge of its only by the inner 
of myself can i in some degree of the i 
receive   yes that is so said pierre joyfully 
  highest is not on reason alone not on 
those of history and the like into which intellectual knowledge 
is divided the highest is one the highest has but 
one science science of the whole science explaining the whole 
and man place in it to receive that science it 
is necessary to and one inner self and so before 
one can know it is necessary to believe and to 
one self and to this end we have the light 
called conscience that god has in our   yes 
pierre   then at inner self with the eyes 
of the spirit and ask whether art with what on 
reason only what art you are young you are rich 
you are clever you are well educated and what have 
you done with all these good are you with yourself 
and with your life   i hate my life 
pierre muttered   it then change it and as 
art gain look at your life my dear sir how 
have you spent it in riotous and debauchery receiving everything 
from society and giving nothing in return you have become 
the of wealth how have you used it what have 
you done for your have you ever thought of your 
tens of thousands of have you helped them physically and 
morally no you have by their to lead a life 
that is what you have done have you a post 
in which you might be of service to your no 
you have spent your life in then you married my 
dear sir on yourself responsibility for the of a young 
woman and what have you done you have not helped 
her to find the way of truth my dear sir 
but have thrust her into an of and a man 
offended you and you him and you say you do 
not know god and hate your life there is nothing 
strange in that my dear sir  after these words 
the as if tired by his long again leaned his 
arms on the back of the sofa and closed his 
eyes pierre looked at that aged stern almost lifeless face 
and moved his lips without uttering a sound he wished 
to say  a life but dared not break the 
silence  the his as old men do and called 
his   about the horses he asked without looking 
at pierre   horses have just come answered the 
 you not rest here   tell them to 
  he really be going away leaving me alone 
without having told me all and without promising to help 
me thought pierre rising with head and he began to 
the room glancing occasionally at the  i never thought 
of it but i have led a and life though 
i did not like it and did not want to 
thought pierre  this man knows the truth and if 
he wished to could it to me  pierre wished 
to say this to the but did not to the 
having his things with his hands began his coat when 
he had finished he turned to bezukhov and said in 
a tone of indifferent politeness   are you going 
to now my dear sir   i going to 
petersburg answered pierre in a childlike voice  thank you 
i agree with all you have said but do not 
suppose me to be so bad with my whole soul 
i wish to be what you would have me be 
but i have never had help from anyone but it 
is i above all who am to for everything help 
me me and perhaps i may  pierre could not 
go on he and turned away  the remained silent 
for a long time evidently considering   comes from 
god alone he said  such measure of help as 
our order can it will you my dear sir you 
are going to petersburg hand this to count  took 
out his and wrote a few words on a large 
of paper in four  me to give you a 
piece of advice when you reach the capital first of 
all some time to and self and do not your 
former way of life and now i wish you a 
good my dear sir he added seeing that his had 
entered  success  the was as pierre saw from 
the book had been one of the best and even 
in time for a long while after he had gone 
pierre did not go to bed or order horses but 
up and down the room over his past and with 
a rapturous sense of beginning to himself the virtuous future 
that seemed to him so easy it seemed to him 
that he had been only because he had somehow forgotten 
how good it is to be virtuous not a trace 
of his former remained in his soul he firmly believed 
in the of the of men in the aim of 
one another in the path of and that is how 
itself to him      chapter iii 
  on reaching petersburg pierre did not let anyone 
know of his arrival he went nowhere and spent whole 
days in reading a whose book had been sent him 
by someone one thing he continually realized as he read 
that book the joy to him of in the of 
perfection and in the of active love among men which 
had revealed to him a week after his arrival the 
young count whom pierre had known slightly in petersburg society 
came into his room one evening in the official and 
manner in which dolokhov second had called on him and 
having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that 
there was else in the room addressed pierre   
have come to you with a and an count he 
said without sitting down  person of very high standing 
in our has made for you to be received into 
our order before the usual and has to me to 
be your i consider it a duty to fulfill that 
person wishes do you wish to enter the of under 
my  the cold tone of this man whom he 
had almost always before met at balls amiably smiling in 
the society of the most brilliant women surprised pierre  
 i do wish it said he  bowed his 
head   more question count he said  i 
beg you to answer in all as a future but 
as an man have you your former you believe in 
god  pierre considered   yes i believe in 
god he said   that case began but pierre 
interrupted him   i do believe in god he 
repeated   that case we can go said  
carriage is at your service  was silent the drive 
to pierre as to what he must do and how 
he should answer only replied that more worthy than he 
would test him and that pierre had only to tell 
the truth  having entered the courtyard of a large 
house where the had its and having ascended a dark 
staircase they entered a small well anteroom where they took 
off their cloaks without the of a from there they 
passed into another room a man in strange appeared at 
the door toward him said something to him in french 
in an and then went up to a small in 
which pierre noticed such as he had never seen before 
having taken a from the pierre eyes with it and 
tied it in a behind some hairs in the then 
he drew his face down kissed him and taking him 
by the hand led him forward the hairs tied in 
the hurt pierre and there were lines of on his 
face and a smile his huge figure with arms hanging 
down and with a puckered though smiling face moved after 
with uncertain timid steps  having led him about ten 
stopped   happens to you he said  must 
bear it all if you have firmly to join our 
 nodded  you hear a at the door you 
will your eyes added  wish you courage and success 
and pressing pierre hand he went out  left alone 
pierre went on smiling in the same way once or 
twice he shrugged his and raised his hand to the 
as if wishing to take it off but let it 
drop again the five minutes spent with his eyes seemed 
to him an hour his arms felt his legs almost 
gave way it seemed to him that he was tired 
out he experienced a of most he felt afraid of 
what would happen to him and still more afraid of 
showing his fear he felt to know what was going 
to happen and what would be revealed to him but 
most of all he felt joyful that the moment had 
come when he would at last start on that path 
of and on the virtuous life of which he had 
been since he met loud were heard at the door 
pierre took the off his eyes and glanced around him 
the room was in black only a small was burning 
inside something white pierre went nearer and saw that the 
stood on a black table on which lay an open 
book the book was the and the white thing with 
the inside was a human skull with its and teeth 
after reading the first words of the  the beginning 
was the word and the word was with god pierre 
went round the table and saw a large open box 
filled with something it was a with bones inside he 
was not at all surprised by what he saw to 
enter on an entirely new life quite unlike the old 
one he expected everything to be even more than what 
he was seeing a skull a the seemed to him 
that he had expected all this and even more trying 
to his he looked around  death love the of 
man he kept saying to himself these words with yet 
joyful ideas the door opened and someone came in  
by the light to which pierre had already become accustomed 
he saw a rather short man having evidently come from 
the light into the the man paused then moved with 
steps toward the table and placed on it his small 
hands  this short man had on a white which 
covered his chest and part of his legs he had 
on a kind of necklace above which rose a high 
white ruffle his rather long face which was lit up 
from below   what have you come asked the 
turning in pierre direction at a slight rustle made by 
the latter  have you who do not believe in 
the truth of the light and who have not seen 
the light come here what do you from us  
at the moment the door opened and the stranger came 
in pierre felt a sense of and such as he 
had experienced in his at he felt himself in the 
presence of one a complete stranger yet nearer to him 
through the of man with and heart he moved toward 
the  which name the brother who prepared a for 
entrance into the was known drawing nearer he recognized in 
the a man he knew and it mortified him to 
think that the was an acquaintance wished him simply a 
brother and a virtuous for a long time he could 
not utter a word so that the had to his 
question   i i desire pierre uttered with difficulty 
  well said and went on at once  
you any idea of the means by which our order 
will help you to reach your aim said he quietly 
and quickly   hope for help in said pierre 
with a voice and some difficulty in to his excitement 
and to being to speak of abstract matters in russian 
  is your of   imagine that is 
the and equality of men who have virtuous said pierre 
feeling ashamed of the of his words for the solemnity 
of the moment as he spoke  imagine   
said the quickly apparently satisfied with this answer  you 
for means of your aim in   i considered 
it and did not follow it said pierre so softly 
that the did not hear him and asked him what 
he was saying  have been an answered pierre  
 are for truth in order to follow its in 
your life therefore you and is that not so said 
the after a moment pause   yes pierre  
the his his hands on his breast and began to 
speak   i must to you the chief aim 
of our order he said  if this aim with 
yours you may enter our with the first and chief 
object of our order the on which it and which 
no human power can is the and on to of 
a certain important which has come down to us from 
the even from the first man on which perhaps the 
fate of mankind depends but since this is of such 
a nature that can know or use it unless he 
be prepared by long and self not everyone can hope 
to it quickly we have a aim that of preparing 
our members as much as possible to reform their hearts 
to and their minds by means on to us by 
from those who have to this and to them capable 
of receiving it   and our members we try 
to the whole human race it in our members an 
example of and and try with all our might to 
the which the world think this over and i will 
come to you again   the which the world 
pierre repeated and a mental of his future in this 
direction rose in his mind he imagined men such as 
he had himself been a ago and he addressed an 
to them he imagined to himself and unfortunate people whom 
he would assist by word and deed imagined whose he 
would rescue of the three mentioned by the this last 
that of mankind especially to pierre the important mentioned by 
the though it his curiosity did not seem to him 
essential and the second aim that of and himself did 
not much interest him because at that moment he felt 
with that he was already perfectly of his former and 
was ready for all that was good  half an 
hour later the returned to inform the of the seven 
to the seven steps of which every freemason should in 
himself these were  the keeping of the secrets of 
the order  to those of higher ranks in the 
order     love of mankind  courage 
  the love of death   the place 
try by the thought of death the said  bring 
yourself to regard it not as a foe but as 
a friend that the soul grown weary in the of 
from this life and leads it to its place of 
and peace   that must be so thought pierre 
when after these words the went away leaving him to 
meditation  must be so but i am still so 
weak that i love my life the meaning of which 
is only now gradually opening before me but five of 
the other which pierre recalled counting them on his fingers 
he felt already in his soul courage love of mankind 
and especially did not even seem to him a but 
a joy  now felt so glad to be free 
from his own and to his will to those who 
knew the truth he forgot what the was and could 
not it  the third time the came back more 
quickly and asked pierre whether he was still firm in 
his intention and determined to to all that would be 
of him   am ready for everything said pierre 
  must also inform you said the  our 
order its not in words only but also by other 
means which may perhaps have a effect on the sincere 
after and than mere words this with what you see 
should already have suggested to your heart if it is 
sincere more than words could do you will perhaps also 
see in your further a like method of our order 
the that explained their by a said the  an 
of something not by the but which qualities those of 
the  pierre knew very well what a was but 
dared not speak he listened to the in silence feeling 
from all he said that his was about to begin 
  you are i must begin your said the 
coming closer to pierre  token of i ask you 
to give me all your   i have nothing 
here replied pierre that he was asked to give up 
all he possessed   you have with you watch 
money rings  pierre quickly took out his purse and 
watch but could not manage for some time to get 
the ring off his fat finger when that had been 
done the said   token of i ask you 
to  pierre took off his coat waistcoat and left 
to the the drew the shirt back from pierre left 
breast and down pulled up the left of his to 
above the knee pierre hurriedly began taking off his right 
also and was going to up the other to save 
this stranger the trouble but the told him that was 
not necessary and gave him a for his left foot 
with a childlike smile of embarrassment doubt and self which 
appeared on his face against his will pierre stood with 
his arms hanging down and legs apart before his brother 
and his further commands   now in token of 
i ask you to to me your chief said the 
latter   i have had so many replied pierre 
  which more than all others you to on 
the path of said the  pierre paused a reply 
  anger women he went over his in his 
mind not knowing to which of them to give the 
  he said in a low scarcely audible voice 
 the did not move and for a long time 
said nothing after this answer at last he moved up 
to pierre and taking the that lay on the table 
again his eyes   the last time i say 
to you all your attention upon yourself put a on 
your and not in but in your own heart the 
of is not without us but within  pierre had 
already long been feeling in himself that of which now 
his heart with glad      chapter 
iv   soon after this there came into the 
dark to pierre not the but pierre whom he recognized 
by his voice to fresh questions as to the of 
his resolution pierre replied  yes i agree and with 
a beaming childlike smile his fat chest and timidly in 
one and one foot he while held a sword to 
his bare chest he was conducted from that room along 
that turned and and was at last brought to the 
doors of the he was answered by the with the 
doors opened before them a bass voice  was still 
him as to who he was when and where he 
was born and so on then he was again led 
somewhere still and as they went along he was told 
of the of his of friendship of the of the 
and of the courage with which he should endure and 
during these pierre noticed that he was spoken of now 
as the  now as the  and now as 
the  to the of with and as he was 
being led up to some object he noticed a and 
among his he heard those around him in and one 
of them insisting that he should be led along a 
certain after that they took his right hand placed it 
on something and told him to hold a pair of 
to his left breast with the other hand and to 
after someone who read aloud an of to the of 
the order the candles were then extinguished and some spirit 
lighted as pierre knew by the smell and he was 
told that he would now see the light the was 
taken off his eyes and by the faint light of 
the burning spirit pierre as in a saw several men 
standing before him wearing like the and holding in their 
hands pointed at his breast among them stood a man 
whose white shirt was with blood on seeing this pierre 
moved forward with his breast toward the meaning them to 
it but the were drawn back from him and he 
was at once again   seen the light uttered 
a voice then the candles were and he was told 
that he would see the full light the was again 
removed and more than ten voices said together   
pierre gradually began to himself and looked about at the 
room and at the people in it round a long 
table covered with black sat some twelve men in like 
those he had already seen some of them pierre had 
met in petersburg society in the chair sat a young 
man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging 
from his neck on his right sat the italian abbe 
whom pierre had met at anna pavlovna two years before 
there were also present a very distinguished and a who 
had been tutor at the kuragins all a solemn silence 
listening to the words of the who held a in 
his hand let into the wall was a star light 
at one side of the table was a small with 
worked upon it at the other was something an on 
which lay a and a skull round it stood seven 
large like those used in two of the led pierre 
up to the placed his feet at right and him 
lie down saying that he must himself at the of 
the   must first receive the whispered one of 
the   please said another  pierre perplexed looked 
round with his eyes without and suddenly in his mind 
 am i what am i doing they laughing at 
me i be ashamed to remember this but these only 
a moment pierre glanced at the serious faces of those 
around remembered all he had already gone through and realized 
that he could not stop halfway he was at his 
and trying to his former feeling himself before the of 
the and really the feeling of devotion returned to him 
even more strongly than before when he had there some 
time he was told to get up and a white 
such as the others wore was put on him he 
was given a and three of gloves and then the 
grand addressed him he told him that he should try 
to do nothing to the of that which strength and 
then of the he told him to with it to 
his own heart from and to with it the heart 
of his as to the first pair of gloves a 
man he said that pierre could not know their meaning 
but must keep them the second pair of man gloves 
he was to wear at the and finally of the 
third a pair of women gloves he said  brother 
these woman gloves are intended for you too give them 
to the woman whom you shall honor most of all 
this will be a of your of heart to her 
whom you to be your worthy in and after a 
pause he added  beware dear brother that these gloves 
do not hands that are while the grand said these 
last words it seemed to pierre that he grew pierre 
himself grew still more confused blushed like a child till 
tears came to his eyes began looking about him uneasily 
and an awkward pause followed  this silence was broken 
by one of the who led pierre up to the 
and began reading to him from a book an of 
all the on it the sun the moon a a 
line a a rough stone and a stone a three 
and so on then a place was assigned to pierre 
he was shown the signs of the told the and 
at last was to sit down the grand began reading 
the they were very long and pierre from joy agitation 
and embarrassment was not in a state to understand what 
was being read he managed to follow only the last 
words of the and these remained in his mind  
 our we recognize no other read the grand  
those between and beware of making any which may equality 
fly to a brother whoever he may be him who 
him that never bear or toward brother be kindly and 
in all hearts the of happiness with and may never 
the of that forgive do not avenge except by doing 
him good thus the highest law of the dignity which 
lost  he finished and getting up embraced and kissed 
pierre who with tears of joy in his eyes looked 
round him not knowing how to answer the and greetings 
from that met him on all sides he no but 
saw in all these men only and with impatience to 
set to work with them  the grand with his 
all the sat down in their places and one of 
them read an on the necessity of  the grand 
that the last duty should be performed and the distinguished 
who bore the of  of went round to all 
the pierre would have liked to all he had but 
fearing that it might look like pride the same amount 
as the others  the meeting was at an end 
and on reaching home pierre felt as if he had 
returned from a long on which he had spent of 
years had become completely changed and had quite left behind 
his former and way of life     
 chapter v   the day after he had 
been received into the pierre was sitting at home reading 
a book and trying to the of the square one 
side of which god another things a third things and 
the fourth a of these now and then his attention 
from the book and the square and he formed in 
a new plan of life on the previous evening at 
the he had heard that a of his had reached 
the emperor and that it would be for him to 
leave petersburg pierre going to his estates in the south 
and there to the welfare of his serfs he was 
joyfully planning this new life when prince vasili suddenly entered 
the room   dear fellow what have you been 
up to in moscow why have you with helene mon 
cher you are under a said prince vasili as he 
entered  know all about it and i can tell 
you that helene is as innocent before you as was 
before the  pierre was about to reply but prince 
vasili interrupted him   why didn you simply come 
straight to me as to a friend i know all 
about it and understand it all he said  behaved 
as a man who his honor perhaps too hastily but 
we won go into that but consider the position in 
which you are placing her and me in the eyes 
of society and even of the court he added lowering 
his voice  is living in moscow and you are 
here remember dear boy and he drew pierre arm downwards 
 is simply a i expect you feel it so 
yourself let us write her a letter at once and 
she come here and all will be explained or else 
my dear boy let me tell you it quite likely 
you have to suffer for it  prince vasili gave 
pierre a significant look   know from that the 
dowager empress is taking a interest in the whole affair 
you know she is very gracious to helene  pierre 
tried several times to speak but on one hand prince 
vasili did not let him and on the other pierre 
himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of 
decided and in which he had firmly to answer his 
father moreover the words of the  kindly and to 
him he went red got up and sat down again 
with himself to do what was for him the most 
difficult thing in life say an unpleasant thing to a 
man face to say what the other whoever he might 
be did not expect he was so used to to 
prince vasili tone of careless self that he felt he 
would be unable to it now but he also felt 
that on what he said now his future he would 
follow the same old road or that new path so 
shown him by the on which he firmly believed he 
would be to a new life   dear boy 
said prince vasili playfully   and i write to 
her myself and we will kill the  but before 
prince vasili had finished his playful speech pierre without looking 
at him and with a kind of that made him 
like his father muttered in a whisper   i 
did not ask you here go please go and he 
jumped up and opened the door for him   
he repeated at himself and glad to see the look 
of and fear that showed itself on prince vasili face 
  the matter with you are you ill  
 the quivering voice repeated and prince vasili had to 
go without receiving any  a week later pierre having 
taken leave of his new friends the and leaving large 
of money with them for went away to his estates 
his new gave him to the and and promised to 
write to him and him in his new   
   chapter vi   the between pierre 
and dolokhov was hushed up and in spite of the 
emperor severity regarding at that time neither the nor their 
for it but the story of the by pierre with 
his wife was the talk of society pierre who had 
been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate 
son and and when he was the best match in 
russia had greatly in the of society after his the 
daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him 
as he did not know how and did not wish 
to court society favor now he alone was for what 
had happened he was said to be and subject like 
his father to fits of and when after pierre helene 
returned to petersburg she was received by all her not 
only but even with a of to her when conversation 
turned on her husband helene assumed a dignified expression which 
with tact she had though she did not understand its 
this expression suggested that she had to endure her and 
that her husband was a cross laid upon her by 
god prince vasili expressed his opinion more he shrugged his 
shoulders when pierre was mentioned and pointing to his forehead 
remarked   bit touched always said so   
said from the first declared anna pavlovna referring to pierre 
 said at the time and before anyone else  
on her  that young man was spoiled by the 
ideas of these days i said so even at the 
time when everybody was in about him when he had 
just returned from abroad and when if you remember he 
as a sort of at one of my and how 
has it ended i was against this even then and 
all that has happened  anna pavlovna continued to give 
on free the same kind of as before as she 
alone had the of arranging which was to be found 
 cream of really good society the of the intellectual 
of petersburg as she herself put it besides this refined 
of society anna pavlovna receptions were also distinguished by the 
fact that she always some new and interesting person to 
the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of 
the political of petersburg court society so and distinctly indicated 
 toward the end of  when all the sad 
of napoleon of the prussian army at and and the 
of most of the prussian had been received when our 
had already entered prussia and our second war with napoleon 
was beginning anna pavlovna gave one of her the  
of really good society of the fascinating helene by her 
husband mortemart the delightful prince hippolyte who had just returned 
from vienna two the old aunt a young man to 
in that drawing room as  man of great  
de beaucoup de a newly appointed maid of honor and 
her mother and several other less persons  the anna 
pavlovna was setting before her guests that evening was boris 
who had just arrived as a special from the prussian 
army and was aide to a very important  the 
temperature shown by the political to the company that evening 
was this   the sovereigns and may do to 
countenance bonaparte and to cause me and us in general 
annoyance and our opinion of bonaparte cannot we shall not 
to express our sincere views on that subject and can 
only say to the king of prussia and others  
much the worse for you l george that all we 
have to say about it  when boris who was 
to be served up to the guests entered the drawing 
room almost all the company had assembled and the conversation 
by anna pavlovna was about our relations with austria and 
the hope of an alliance with her  boris grown 
more and looking fresh rosy and self entered the drawing 
room dressed in the uniform of an aide and was 
conducted to pay his to the aunt and then brought 
back to the general circle  anna pavlovna gave him 
her hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons 
whom he did not know giving him a whispered description 
of each   hippolyte kuragin the d from profound 
and simply  man of great of the man usually 
so described  to anna mikhaylovna his own and the 
of his nature boris had managed during his service to 
place himself very he was aide to a very important 
had been sent on a very important to prussia and 
had just returned from there as a special he had 
become thoroughly with that with which he had been so 
pleased at and to which an ensign might rank higher 
than a general and to which what was for success 
in the service was not effort or work or courage 
or but only the knowledge of how to get on 
with those who can grant and he was himself often 
surprised at the of his success and at the inability 
of others to understand these things in of this his 
whole manner of life all his relations with old friends 
all his for his future were completely altered he was 
not rich but would spend his last to be better 
dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of many 
than allow himself to be seen in a or appear 
in the of petersburg in an old uniform he made 
friends with and the acquaintance of only those above him 
in position and who could therefore be of use to 
him he liked petersburg and moscow the remembrance of the 
rostovs house and of his childish love for natasha was 
unpleasant to him and he had not once been to 
see the rostovs since the day of his for the 
army to be in anna pavlovna drawing room he considered 
an important step up in the service and he at 
once understood his role letting his hostess make use of 
interest he had to he himself carefully scanned each face 
the of with each of those present and the advantages 
that might he took the seat indicated to him beside 
the fair helene and listened to the general conversation  
 considers the of the so that not even a 
of most brilliant would secure them and she the means 
we have of gaining them that is the phrase used 
by the vienna said the d   doubt is 
said  man of profound with a subtle smile  
 must distinguish between the vienna and the emperor of 
austria said mortemart  emperor of austria can never have 
thought of such a thing it is only the that 
says it   my dear vicomte put in anna 
pavlovna   some reason she called it as if 
that were a specially refined french which she could allow 
herself when conversing with a frenchman  sincere   
       will never be 
our sincere   after that anna pavlovna led up 
to the courage and of the king of prussia in 
order to draw boris into the conversation  boris listened 
attentively to each of the awaiting his turn but managed 
meanwhile to look round at his the beautiful helene whose 
eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide 
with a smile  speaking of the position of prussia 
anna pavlovna very naturally asked boris to tell them about 
his to and in what state he found the prussian 
army boris speaking with told them in correct french many 
interesting about the and the court carefully from expressing an 
opinion of his own about the he was for some 
time he the general attention and anna pavlovna felt that 
the she had served up was received with pleasure by 
all her visitors the greatest attention of all to boris 
was shown by helene she asked him several questions about 
his and seemed greatly interested in the state of the 
prussian army as soon as he had finished she turned 
to him with her usual smile   absolutely must 
come and see me she said in a tone that 
that for certain he could not know of this was 
absolutely necessary   between eight and nine it will 
give me great pleasure  boris promised to fulfill her 
wish and was about to begin a conversation with her 
when anna pavlovna called him away on the pretext that 
her aunt wished to hear him   know her 
husband of course said anna pavlovna her eyes and indicating 
helene with a gesture  she is such an unfortunate 
and charming woman don mention him before her don it 
is too painful for her      
chapter vii   when boris and anna pavlovna returned 
to the others prince hippolyte had the of the company 
 bending forward in his armchair he said  de 
and having said this laughed everyone turned toward him  
 de hippolyte said again laughing and then and seriously 
sat back in his chair anna pavlovna waited for him 
to go on but as he seemed quite decided to 
say no more she began to tell of how at 
the bonaparte had the sword of the great   
is the sword of the great which i she began 
but hippolyte interrupted her with the words  de and 
again as soon as all turned toward him himself and 
said no more  anna pavlovna frowned mortemart hippolyte friend 
addressed him firmly   now what about your de 
 hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing   
it nothing i only wished to say  wanted to 
a joke he had heard in vienna and which he 
had been trying all that evening to get in  
only wished to say that we are wrong to fight 
le de  boris smiled so that it might be 
taken as ironical or to the way the joke was 
received everybody laughed   joke is too bad it 
witty but said anna pavlovna shaking her little finger at 
him   are not le de but for right 
oh that wicked prince hippolyte she said  the conversation 
did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the 
political news it became particularly animated toward the end of 
the evening when the bestowed by the emperor were mentioned 
  know received a snuffbox with the portrait last 
year said  man of profound  get the same 
  me a snuffbox with the emperor portrait is 
a reward but not a said the diplomatist rather  
 are i may mention   impossible replied another 
  you bet the ribbon of the order is 
a different matter  when everybody rose to go helene 
who had spoken very little all the evening again turned 
to boris asking him in a tone of significant command 
to come to her on   is of great 
importance to me she said turning with a smile toward 
anna pavlovna and anna pavlovna with the same sad smile 
with which she spoke of her patroness helene wish  
it seemed as if from some words boris had spoken 
that evening about the prussian army helene had suddenly found 
it necessary to see him she seemed to promise to 
explain that necessity to him when he came on  
but on evening having come to helene splendid boris received 
no clear of why it had been necessary for him 
to come there were other guests and the countess talked 
little to him and only as he kissed her hand 
on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper with 
a face  to dinner tomorrow in the evening you 
must come come  during that stay in petersburg boris 
became an intimate in the countess house    
  chapter viii   the war was flaming 
up and the russian everywhere one heard on bonaparte  
of mankind and were being in the and from the 
seat of war came news as usual and therefore the 
life of old prince bolkonski prince andrew and princess mary 
had greatly changed since   in  the old 
prince was made one of the eight in chief then 
appointed to the russia despite the weakness of age which 
had become particularly since the time when he thought his 
son had been killed he did not think it right 
to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed 
by the emperor himself and this fresh opportunity for gave 
him new energy and strength he was continually through the 
three to him was in the fulfillment of his duties 
severe to with his and went into everything down to 
the himself princess mary had ceased taking lessons in from 
her father and when the old prince was at home 
went to his study with the nurse and little prince 
nicholas  his called him the baby prince nicholas lived 
with his nurse and nurse in the late princess rooms 
and princess mary spent most of the day in the 
nursery taking a mother place to her little as best 
she could mademoiselle too seemed passionately fond of the boy 
and princess mary often herself to give her friend the 
pleasure of the little she called her playing with him 
 near the of the at bald hills there was 
a over the of the little princess and in this 
was a marble brought from an with wings ready to 
fly the upper lip was slightly raised as though about 
to smile and once on coming out of the prince 
andrew and princess mary to one another that the face 
reminded them of the little princess but what was still 
stranger though of this prince andrew said nothing to his 
sister was that in the expression the had happened to 
give the face prince andrew read the same reproach he 
had read on the face of his dead wife  
why have you done this to me  soon after 
prince andrew return the old prince made over to him 
a large about twenty from bald hills because of the 
with bald hills because prince andrew did not always feel 
equal to bearing with his father and because he prince 
andrew made use of began building and spent most of 
his time there  after the prince andrew had firmly 
not to continue his military service and when the war 
and everybody had to serve he took a post under 
his father in the so as to avoid active service 
the old prince and his son seemed to have changed 
since the of  the old man roused by expected 
the best from the new while prince andrew on the 
contrary taking no part in the war and secretly this 
saw only the dark side  on   the 
old prince set off on one of his prince andrew 
remained at bald hills as usual during his father little 
nicholas had been for four days the who had driven 
the old prince to town returned bringing papers and for 
prince andrew  not finding the young prince in his 
study the went with the to princess mary apartments but 
did not find him there he was told that the 
prince had gone to the nursery   you please

to prince andrew who was sitting on a child little 
chair while frowning and with hands he from a bottle 
into a half full of water   is it

into the glass he threw the onto the floor and 
asked for some more water the maid brought it  
there were in the room a child two two a 
table a child table and the little chair on which 
prince andrew was sitting the were drawn and a single 
was burning on the table by a music book so 
that the light did not fall on the   
dear said princess mary addressing her brother from beside the 
where she was standing  wait a bit later  
 leave off you always talk nonsense and keep putting 
things off this is what comes of it said prince 
andrew in an exasperated whisper evidently meaning to wound his 
sister   dear really it better not to him 
he said the princess in a tone of entreaty  
prince andrew got up and went on up to the 
little bed in hand   we really better not 
him he said   you please really i think 
so but as you please said princess mary evidently intimidated 
and confused that her opinion had she drew her brother 
attention to the maid who was calling him in a 
whisper  it was the second night that neither of 
them had watching the boy who was in a high 
these last days their household doctor and expecting another for

out   take them he muttered and after listening 
to the his father had sent and taking the and 
his father letter he returned to the nursery

princess mary with a sigh  prince andrew went up 
to the child and felt him he was burning hot 
  you and your he took the glass with 
the and again went up to the   don 
said princess mary  but he at her angrily though 
also with suffering in his eyes and stooped glass in

shoulders but took the glass and calling the nurse began 
giving the the child screamed prince andrew and his head 
went out and sat down on a sofa in the 
next room  he still had all the in his

let him and he began reading letter which was written 
in french he read without understanding half of it read 
only to forget if but for a moment what he 
had too long been thinking of so to the of 
all else      chapter ix  
 was now at army in a capacity and though 
he wrote in french and used french and french he 
described the whole with a fearless self and self russian 
wrote that the obligation of tormented him and he was 
happy to have in prince andrew a to whom he 
could out the he had at the sight of all 
that was being done in the army the letter was 
old having been written before the battle at   
the day of our brilliant success at wrote  you 
know my dear prince i never leave i have certainly 
a taste for war and it is just as well 
for me what i have seen during these last three 
months is incredible   begin  of the human 
race as you know the the are our faithful who 
have only us three times in three years we take 
up their cause but it out that  of the 
human race no to our fine and in his and 
way himself on the without giving them time to finish 
the they had and in two of the hand he 
them to and himself in the at   most 
desire writes the king of prussia to bonaparte  your 
majesty should be received and treated in my in a 
manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances 
allowed i have hastened to take all steps to that 
end may i have succeeded the prussian pride themselves on 
being polite to the french and lay down their arms 
at the first demand   head of the at 
with ten thousand men asks the king of prussia what 
he is to do if he is to all this 
is absolutely true   short to matters by taking 
up a attitude it out that we have ourselves in 
war and what is more in war on our own 
with and for the king of prussia we have everything 
in order only one little thing is a commander in 
chief as it was considered that the success might have 
been more had the commander in chief not been so 
young all our were and of and the latter was 
the general comes to us suvorov in a and is 
received with of joy and   the  the 
first courier from petersburg the are taken to the field 
room for he to do everything himself i am called 
in to help sort the and take those meant for 
us the field looks on and for addressed to him 
we search but none are to be found the field 
impatient and sets to work himself and finds from the 
emperor to count prince v and others then he into 
one of his wild and at everyone and everything the 
them and those from the emperor addressed to others  
so that the way they treat me no confidence in 
me ah ordered to keep an eye on me very 
well then get along with you so he writes the 
famous order of the day to general   am 
and cannot ride and cannot command the army you have 
brought your army corps to here it is exposed and 
without or so something must be done and as you 
yourself to count yesterday you must think of to our 
do today   all my he writes to the 
emperor  have got a which coming after all my 
previous quite my and so an army so i have 
passed on the command to the general next in count 
having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs 
to it him if there is a lack of to 
move farther into the of prussia for only one day 
of remains and in some none at all as by 
the and and all that the had has been up 
i myself will remain in hospital at till i in 
regard to which i my report with the information that 
if the army remains in its present another there will 
not be a man left in it by spring  
 leave to retire to his country seat to an 
old man who is already in any case by being 
unable to fulfill the great and task for which he 
was i shall your most gracious here in hospital that 
i may not have to play the part of a 
secretary rather than commander in the army my from the 
army does not produce the slightest stir man has left 
it there are thousands such as i in russia  
 field is angry with the emperor and he us 
all isn it   is the first act those 
that follow are naturally interesting and after the field it 
that we are within sight of the and must give 
battle is commander in chief by but general does not 
quite see it more particularly as it is he and 
his corps who are within sight of the and he 
wishes to by the opportunity to fight a battle  
his own hand as the say he does so this 
is the battle of which is considered a great but 
in my opinion was nothing of the kind we as 
you know have a very bad way of deciding whether 
a battle was won or lost those who after a 
battle have lost it is what we say and to 
that it is we who lost the battle of in 
short we after the battle but send a courier to 
petersburg with news of a and general to receive from 
petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward 
for his does not give up the command of the 
army to general during this we begin a very and 
interesting of our aim is no longer as it should 
be to avoid or attack the but solely to avoid 
general who by right of should be our chief so 
do we this aim that after crossing an river we 
burn the to separate ourselves from our who at the 
moment is not bonaparte but general was all but attacked 
and captured by a superior force as a result of 
one of these that us to escape him us he 
hardly the river to our side before we to the 
other at last our us and both are angry and 
the result is a challenge on part and an fit 
on but at the moment the courier who carried the 
news of our at to petersburg returns bringing our appointment 
as commander in chief and our first foe is we 
can now turn our thoughts to the second bonaparte but 
as it out just at that moment a third before 
us the russian soldiers loudly meat and the are empty 
the the begin and in a way of which our 
last can give you no idea half the form and 
the and put everything to fire and sword the are 
the with and is everywhere twice the even attack our 
and the commander in chief has to ask for a 
to them during one of these they carried off my 
empty and my gown the emperor to give all of 
the right to but i much fear this will one 
half the army to the other  at first prince 
andrew read with his eyes only but after a while 
in spite of himself  he knew how far it 
was safe to what he had read began to interest 
him more and more when he had read thus far 
he the letter up and threw it away it was 
not what he had read that vexed him but the 
fact that the life out there in which he had 
now no part could him he his eyes rubbed his 
forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in 
what he had read and listened to what was passing 
in the nursery suddenly he thought he heard a strange 
noise through the door he was seized with alarm something 
should have happened to the child while he was reading 
the letter he went on to the nursery door and 
opened it  just as he went in he saw 
that the nurse was hiding something from him with a 
scared look and that princess mary was no longer by 
the   dear he heard what seemed to him 
her whisper behind him  as often happens after long 
and long anxiety he was seized by an occurred to 
him that the child was dead all that he saw 
and heard seemed to this   is over he 
thought and a cold broke out on his forehead he 
went to the in sure that he would find it 
empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead 
baby he drew the aside and for some time his 
frightened eyes could not find the baby at last he 
saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he 
lay across the bed with his head lower than the 
and was his lips in his sleep and breathing  
prince andrew was as glad to find the boy like 
that as if he had already lost him he bent 
over him and as his sister had taught him tried 
with his lips whether the child was still the soft 
forehead was prince andrew touched the head with his hand 
even the hair was so had the child he was 
not dead but evidently the crisis was over and he 
was prince andrew to up to to hold to his 
heart this little creature but dared not do so he 
stood over him gazing at his head and at the 
little arms and legs which showed under the he heard 
a rustle behind him and a appeared under the of 
the he did not look round but still gazing at 
the face listened to his regular breathing the dark was 
princess mary who had come up to the with steps 
lifted the and dropped it again behind her prince andrew 
recognized her without looking and held out his hand to 
her she pressed it   has said prince andrew 
  was coming to tell you so  the 
child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his 
forehead against the  prince andrew looked at his sister 
in the of the her eyes shone more than usual 
from the tears of joy that were in them she 
leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly the 
of the each made the other a gesture and stood 
still in the light beneath the as if not wishing 
to leave that where they three were off from all 
the world prince andrew was the first to move away 
ruffling his hair against the muslin of the   
this is the one thing left me now he said 
with a sigh      chapter x 
  soon after his to the pierre went to 
the where he had the greatest number of serfs taking 
with him full directions which he had written down for 
his own as to what he should do on his 
estates  when he reached he sent for all his 
to the head and explained to them his intentions and 
wishes he told them that steps would be taken immediately 
to free his serfs that till then they were not 
to be with women while their were not to be 
sent to work was to be given to the serfs 
were to be and not and and were to be 
on all the estates some of the  were among 
them listened with alarm these words to mean that the 
young count was with their and of money some after 
their first were amused by pierre and the new words 
they had not heard before others simply enjoyed hearing how 
the talked while the among them including the chief understood 
from this speech how they could best handle the for 
their own  the chief expressed great sympathy with pierre 
intentions but remarked that besides these it would be necessary 
to go into the general state of affairs which was 
far from  despite count bezukhov enormous wealth since he 
had come into an income which was said to amount 
to five hundred thousand rubles a year pierre felt himself 
far than when his father had made him an of 
ten thousand rubles he had a perception of the following 
 about  went in on all the estates to 
the land bank about  went for the of the 
near moscow the town house and the to the three 
princesses about  was given in and the same amount 
for  was sent to the countess about  went 
for interest on the building of a new had cost 
about  in each of the last two years and 
he did not know how the rest about  rubles 
was spent and almost every year he was to besides 
this the chief wrote every year telling him of and 
bad or of the necessity of and so the first 
task pierre had to face was one for which he 
had very little or business  he discussed affairs every 
day with his chief but he felt that this did 
not forward matters at all he felt that these were 
from real affairs and did not up with them or 
make them move on the one hand the chief put 
the state of things to him in the very light 
pointing out the necessity of paying off the and new 
with to which pierre did not agree on the other 
hand pierre demanded that steps should be taken to the 
serfs which the met by showing the necessity of first 
paying off the from the land bank and the impossibility 
of a emancipation  the did not say it was 
quite impossible but suggested the in the of the land 
lower down the river and the in order to make 
it possible all of which to him were connected with 
such of petitions and so on pierre became quite and 
only replied   yes do so  pierre had 
none of the practical that would have him to attend 
to the business himself and so he it and only 
tried to to the that he was to it the 
for his part tried to to the count that he 
considered these very for the and to himself  in 
pierre found some people he knew and hastened to make 
his acquaintance and joyfully the rich the of the to 
pierre greatest weakness one to which he had when to 
the so strong that he could not them again whole 
days and months of his life passed in as great 
a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties 
and balls giving him no time for as in petersburg 
instead of the new life he had to lead he 
still lived the old life only in new  of 
the three of pierre realized that he did not fulfill 
the one which every to set an example of life 
and that of the seven he lacked two and the 
love of death he himself with the thought that he 
another of the of the human race had other of 
his and especially  in the spring of  he 
decided to return to petersburg on the way he intended 
to visit all his estates and see for himself how 
far his orders had been carried out and in what 
state were the serfs whom god had to his care 
and whom he intended to  the chief who considered 
the young count almost to himself to the count and 
to the serfs some continuing to represent the of the 
serfs as he arranged for the of large and all 
the estates before the arrived everywhere were made not for 
 he knew pierre would not like but for just 
such gratefully ones with of and the and of as 
to his understanding of his would touch and him  
the spring the comfortable in a vienna carriage and the 
of the road all had a effect on pierre the 
estates he had not before were each more than the 
other the serfs everywhere seemed and grateful for the on 
them everywhere were receptions which though they pierre a joyful 
feeling in the of his heart in one place the 
him with and and an of saint peter and saint 
asking as a mark of their gratitude for the he 
had on them to build a new to the at 
their own in honor of peter and his in another 
place the women with in arms met him to thank 
him for them from hard work on a third the 
bearing a cross came to meet him by children whom 
by the count he was in reading and on all 
his estates pierre saw with his own eyes or in 
course of all on one plan for and which were 
soon to be opened everywhere he saw the accounts to 
which the serfs had been and heard the touching of 
of serfs in their full blue  what pierre did 
not know was that the place where they him with 
and and wished to build a in honor of peter 
and was a village where a fair was held on 
st peter day and that the  formed the had 
the long before but that nine of the in that 
were in a state of the greatest poverty he did 
not know that since the mothers were no longer sent 
to work on his land they did still work on 
their own land he did not know that the who 
met him with the cross the by his and that 
the parents wept at having to let him take their 
children and their release by heavy he did not know 
that the built to plan were being built by serfs 
whose was thus though on paper he did not know 
that where the had shown him in the accounts that 
the serfs had been by a third their work had 
been by a half and so pierre was delighted with 
his visit to his estates and quite the mood in 
which he had left petersburg and wrote enthusiastic to his 
 as he called the grand   easy it 
is how little effort it to do so much good 
thought pierre  how little attention we pay to it 
 he was pleased at the gratitude he received but 
felt at receiving it this gratitude reminded him of how 
much more he might do for these simple kindly people 
 the chief a very stupid but man who saw 
perfectly through the naive and intelligent count and played with 
him as with a seeing the effect these receptions had 
on pierre pressed him still with of the impossibility and 
above all the of the serfs who were quite happy 
as it was  pierre in his secret soul agreed 
with the that it would be difficult to imagine happier 
people and that god only knew what would happen to 
them when they were free but he though reluctantly on 
what he thought right the promised to do all in 
his power to carry out the count wishes seeing clearly 
that not only would the count never be able to 
find out whether all had been taken for the of 
the land and and to release them from the land 
bank but would probably never even and would never know 
that the newly were standing empty and that the serfs 
continued to give in money and work all that other 
people serfs gave is to say all that could be 
got out of them      chapter 
xi   returning from his through south russia in 
the state of mind pierre carried out an intention he 
had long had of visiting his friend bolkonski whom he 
had not seen for two years  lay in a 
flat part of the country among and of and which 
were cut down the house lay behind a newly filled 
with water to the and with still bare of grass 
it was at the end of a village that along 
the in the midst of a young in which were 
a few  the of a floor a a and 
a large house with still in course of round the 
house was a garden newly laid out the and were 
new and two fire and a water green stood in 
a the were straight the were strong and had everything 
bore an of and good some serfs pierre met in 
reply to as to where the prince lived pointed out 
a small newly built close to the a man who 
had looked after prince andrew in his helped pierre out 
of his carriage said that the prince was at home 
and showed him into a clean little anteroom  pierre 
was struck by the of the small though clean house 
after the brilliant in which he had last met his 
friend in petersburg  he quickly entered the small reception 
room with its still of and would have gone farther 
but ran on and at a door   what 
is it came a sharp unpleasant voice   visitor 
answered   him to wait and the sound was 
heard of a chair being pushed back  pierre went 
with steps to the door and suddenly came face to 
face with prince andrew who came out frowning and looking 
old pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his 
friend on the and looked at him   i 
did not expect you i am very glad said prince 
andrew  pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his 
friend with surprise he was struck by the change in 
him his words were kindly and there was a smile 
on his lips and face but his eyes were dull 
and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to 
do so he could not give them a joyous and 
glad prince andrew had grown and more but what and 
pierre till he got used to it were his and 
a on his indicating on some one thought  as 
is usually the case with people meeting after a it 
was long before their conversation could on anything they put 
questions and gave about things they knew ought to be 
talked over at length at last the conversation gradually settled 
on some of the topics at first lightly touched on 
their past life for the future pierre and the war 
and so on the and which pierre had noticed in 
his friend look was now still more clearly expressed in 
the smile with which he listened to pierre especially when 
he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the 
future it was as if prince andrew would have liked 
to with what pierre was saying but could not the 
latter began to feel that it was in bad taste 
to speak of his and of happiness or goodness in 
prince andrew presence he was ashamed to express his new 
views which had been particularly and by his late he 
checked himself fearing to seem naive yet he felt an 
desire to show his friend as soon as possible that 
he was now a quite different and better pierre than 
he had been in petersburg   can tell you 
how much i have lived through since then i hardly 
know myself again   we have altered much very 
much since then said prince andrew   and you 
what are your   repeated prince andrew ironically  
he said as if astonished at the word  you 
see i building i mean to here next year  
pierre looked silently and into prince andrew face which had 
grown much older   i meant to ask pierre 
began but prince andrew interrupted him   why talk 
of me talk to me yes tell me about your 
and all you have been doing on your estates  
pierre began what he had done on his estates trying 
as far as possible to his own part in the 
that had been made prince andrew several times pierre story 
of what he had been doing as though it were 
all an old story and he listened not only without 
interest but even as if ashamed of what pierre was 
telling him  pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in 
his friend company and at last became silent   
tell you what my dear fellow said prince andrew who 
evidently also felt depressed and with his visitor  am 
only here and have just come to look round i 
am going back to my sister today i will introduce 
you to her but of course you know her already 
he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom 
he now found nothing in common  will go after 
dinner and would you now like to look round my 
place  they went out and walked about till dinnertime 
talking of the political news and common like people who 
do not know each other prince andrew spoke with some 
animation and interest only of the new he was and 
its but even here while on the in the midst 
of a talk explaining the future of the house he 
interrupted himself   this is not at all interesting 
let us have dinner and then we set off  
at dinner conversation turned on pierre   was very 
much surprised when i heard of it said prince andrew 
 pierre blushed as he always did when it was 
mentioned and said hurriedly  will tell you some time 
how it all happened but you know it is all 
over and forever   said prince andrew  forever 
  you know how it all ended don you 
you heard of the   so you had to 
go through that too   thing i thank god 
for is that i did not kill that man said 
pierre   so asked prince andrew  kill a 
dog is a very good thing really   to 
kill a man is bad   is it wrong 
prince andrew  is not given to man to know 
what is right and what is wrong men always did 
and always will err and in nothing more than in 
what they consider right and wrong   does to 
another is wrong said pierre feeling with pleasure that for 
the first time since his arrival prince andrew was roused 
had to talk and wanted to express what had brought 
him to his present state   who has told 
you what is bad for another man he asked  
 bad exclaimed pierre  all know what is bad 
for ourselves   we know that but the i 
am conscious of in myself is something i cannot on 
others said prince andrew growing more and more animated and 
evidently wishing to express his new to pierre he spoke 
in french  only know two very real in life 
and illness the only good is the of those to 
live for myself those two is my whole now  
 love of one and self began pierre  i 
can agree with you to live only so as not 
to do and not to have to is not enough 
i lived like that i lived for myself and my 
life and only now when i am living or at 
least trying  made him correct himself  live for 
others only now have i understood all the happiness of 
life no i shall not agree with you and you 
do not really believe what you are saying prince andrew 
looked silently at pierre with an smile   you 
see my sister princess mary you get on with her 
he said  you are right for yourself he added 
after a short pause  everyone lives in his own 
way you lived for yourself and say you nearly your 
life and only found happiness when you began living for 
others i experienced just the reverse i lived for glory 
after all what is glory the same love of others 
a desire to do something for them a desire for 
their approval i lived for others and not almost but 
quite my life and i have become calmer since i 
began to live only for myself   what do 
you mean by living only for yourself asked pierre growing 
 about your son your sister and your father  
 that just the same as myself are not others 
explained prince andrew  others one neighbors le as you 
and princess mary call it are the chief of all 
and le to whom you want to do good  
and he looked at pierre with a expression he evidently 
wished to draw him on   are replied pierre 
growing more and more  or can there be in 
my wishing to do good and even doing a little 
i did very little and did it very badly what 
can there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs 
people like ourselves were growing up and dying with no 
idea of god and truth and meaningless and are now 
in a comforting in future life and what and are 
there in it if people were dying of without help 
while material could so easily be and i them with 
a doctor a hospital and an for the aged and 
is it not a unquestionable good if a or a 
woman with a baby has no rest day or night 
and i give them rest and said pierre hurrying and 
 i have done that though badly and to a 
small but i have done something toward it and you 
cannot me that it was not a good and more 
than that you can make me believe that you do 
not think so yourself and the main thing is he 
continued  i know and know for certain that the 
enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness 
in life   if you put it like that 
it quite a different matter said prince andrew  build 
a house and lay out a garden and you build 
the one and the other may serve as a but 
what right and what good must be by one who 
knows all but not by us well you want an 
he added  on then  they rose from the 
table and sat down in the entrance porch which served 
as a   let then said prince andrew  
talk of he went on a finger  and so 
that is you want to him  to a who 
passed by them taking off his cap  his animal 
condition and in him while it seems to me that 
animal happiness is the only happiness possible and that is 
just what you want to deprive him of i him 
but you want to make him what i am without 
giving him my means then you say  his but 
as i see it is as essential to him as 
much a condition of his as mental is to you 
or me you can help thinking i go to bed 
after two in the morning thoughts come and i can 
sleep but about till dawn because i think and can 
help thinking just as he can help and if he 
didn he would go to the drink or fall ill 
just as i could not stand his terrible but should 
die of it in a week so he could not 
stand my but would grow fat and die the third 
thing else was it you talked about and prince andrew 
a third finger  yes he has a fit he 
is dying and you come and him and patch him 
up he will about as a a burden to everybody 
for another ten years it would be far and for 
him to die others are being born and there are 
of them as it is it would be different if 
you losing a how i regard him you want to 
him from love of him and he does not want 
that and besides what a that ever anyone killed them 
yes said he frowning angrily and turning away from pierre 
 prince andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly 
that it was evident he had reflected on this subject 
more than once and he spoke and rapidly like a 
man who has not talked for a long time his 
glance became more animated as his became more hopeless  
 that is dreadful dreadful said pierre  don understand 
how one can live with such ideas i had such 
moments myself not long ago in moscow and when but 
at such times i so that i don live at 
all seems to me myself most of all then i 
don eat don wash and how is it with you 
  not wash that is not said prince andrew 
 the contrary one must try to make one life 
as pleasant as possible i that is not my so 
i must live out my life as best i can 
without others   with such ideas what motive have 
you for living one would sit without moving nothing  
 as it is leaves one no peace i should 
be to do nothing but here on the one hand 
the have done me the honor to choose me to 
be their it was all i could do to get 
out of it they could not understand that i have 
not the necessary for it kind of good necessary for 
the position then there this house which must be built 
in order to have a of one own in which 
to be quiet and now there this recruiting   
you serving in the army   said prince andrew 
 thank you very much i have promised myself not 
to serve again in the active russian army and i 
won even if bonaparte were here at threatening bald hills 
then i serve in the russian army well as i 
was saying he continued his  there this recruiting my 
father is chief in command of the third and my 
only way of active service is to serve under him 
  you are serving   am  he 
paused a little while   why do you serve 
  for this reason my father is one of 
the most men of his time but he is growing 
old and though not exactly cruel he has too a 
character he is so accustomed to power that he is 
terrible and now he has this of a commander in 
chief of the recruiting by the emperor if i had 
been two hours late a ago he would have had 
a clerk at said prince andrew with a smile  
i am serving because i alone have any influence with 
my father and now and then can save him from 
actions which would him afterwards   there you see 
  but it is not as you imagine prince 
andrew continued  did not and do not in the 
least care about that of a clerk who had some 
from the i should even have been very glad to 
see him but i was sorry for my father again 
is for myself  prince andrew grew more and more 
animated his eyes while he tried to prove to pierre 
that in his actions there was no desire to do 
good to his   now you wish to your 
serfs he continued  is a very good thing but 
not for you don suppose you ever had anyone or 
sent to still less for your serfs if they are 
or sent to i don suppose they are any the 
worse off in they lead the same animal life and 
the on their and they are happy as before but 
it is a good thing for who morally bring upon 
themselves this and grow as a result of being able 
to and it is those people i pity and for 
their sake i should like to the serfs you may 
not have seen but i have seen how good men 
brought up in those of power in time when they 
grow more become cruel and are conscious of it but 
cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more  prince 
andrew spoke so that pierre could not help thinking that 
these thoughts had been suggested to prince andrew by his 
father case  he did not reply   that 
what i sorry for dignity peace of mind and not 
the serfs and which beat and as you may always 
remain the same and   no a thousand times 
no i shall never agree with you said pierre  
    chapter xii   in the 
evening andrew and pierre got into the open carriage and 
drove to bald hills prince andrew glancing at pierre broke 
the silence now and then with remarks which showed that 
he was in a good  pointing to the he 
spoke of the he was making in his  pierre 
remained silent answering in monosyllables and apparently in his own 
thoughts  he was thinking that prince andrew was unhappy 
had gone did not see the true light and that 
he pierre ought to and him but as soon as 
he thought of what he should say he felt that 
prince andrew with one word one would upset all his 
and he from beginning afraid of to possible what to 
him was precious and   but why do you 
think so pierre suddenly began lowering his head and looking 
like a about to  do you think so you 
should not think so   what about asked prince 
andrew with surprise   life about man destiny it 
can be so i myself thought like that and do 
you know what me no don smile is not a 
as i thought it was is the best expression of 
the best the of  and he began to explain 
as he understood it to prince andrew he said that 
is the of from the of state and a of 
equality and love   our has the real meaning 
of life all the rest is a said pierre  
my dear fellow that outside this all is filled with 
and and i agree with you that nothing is left 
for an intelligent and good man but to live out 
his life like you merely trying not to others but 
make our your own join our give yourself up to 
us let yourself be and you will at once feel 
yourself as i have felt myself a part of that 
invisible chain the beginning of which is in heaven said 
pierre  prince andrew looking straight in front of him 
listened in silence to pierre words more than once when 
the noise of the wheels prevented his what pierre said 
he asked him to it and by the peculiar glow 
that came into prince andrew eyes and by his silence 
pierre saw that his words were not in vain and 
that prince andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at 
what he said  they reached a river that had 
overflowed its and which they had to cross by while 
the carriage and horses were being placed on it they 
also stepped on the  prince andrew his arms on 
the gazed silently at the in the setting sun  
 what do you think about it pierre asked  
are you silent   do i think about it 
i am listening to you it all very well you 
say join our and we will show you the aim 
of life the destiny of man and the which the 
world but who are we men how is it you 
know everything why do i alone not see what you 
see you see a of goodness and truth on earth 
but i don see it  pierre interrupted him  
 you believe in a future life he asked  
 future life prince andrew repeated but pierre giving him 
no time to reply took the for a the more 
as he knew prince andrew former   say you 
can see a of goodness and truth on earth nor 
could i and it cannot be seen if one looks 
on our life here as the end of everything on 
earth here on this earth  pointed to the  
is no truth all is and but in the in 
the whole there is a of truth and we who 
are now the children of earth are of the whole 
don i feel in my soul that i am part 
of this whole don i feel that i form one 
one step between the lower and higher in this of 
in whom the power if you the if i see 
clearly see that leading from plant to man why should 
i suppose it off at me and does not go 
farther and farther i feel that i cannot since nothing 
in this world but that i shall always exist and 
always have i feel that me and above me there 
are and that in this world there is truth  
 that is theory said prince andrew  it is 
not that which can me dear friend and death are 
what what is when one a being dear to one 
up with one own life before whom one was to 
and had to make it right  andrew voice trembled 
and he turned away  suddenly that being is seized 
with and to exist why it cannot be that there 
is no answer and i believe there is that what 
that is what has convinced me said prince andrew  
 yes of course said pierre  that what i 
saying   all i say is that it is 
not that me of the necessity of a future life 
but this when you go hand in hand with someone 
and all at once that person there into nowhere and 
you yourself are left facing that and look in and 
i have looked in   that it then you 
know that there is a there and there is a 
someone there is the future life the someone is  
prince andrew did not reply the carriage and horses had 
long since been taken off onto the farther bank and 
the sun had half below the and an evening was 
the near the but pierre and andrew to the of 
the footmen and still stood on the and talked  
 there is a god and future life there is 
truth and good and man highest happiness in to them 
we must live we must love and we must believe 
that we live not only today on this of earth 
but have lived and shall live forever there in the 
whole said pierre and he pointed to the sky  
prince andrew stood on the of the listening to pierre 
and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red 
of the sun on the blue there was pierre became 
silent the had long since stopped and only the waves 
of the current beat softly against it below prince andrew 
felt as if the sound of the waves kept up 
a refrain to pierre words   is true believe 
it  he and glanced with a radiant childlike tender 
look at pierre face flushed and rapturous but yet shy 
before his superior friend   if it only were 
so said prince andrew  it is time to get 
on he added and off the he looked up at 
the sky to which pierre had pointed and for the 
first time since saw that high sky he had seen 
while lying on that and something that had long been 
something that was best within him suddenly joyful and youthful 
in his soul it vanished as soon as he returned 
to the of his life but he knew that this 
feeling which he did not know how to within him 
his meeting with pierre formed an in prince andrew life 
though he continued to live in the same old way 
he began a new life      
chapter xiii   it was getting when prince andrew 
and pierre drove up to the front entrance of the 
house at bald hills as they approached the house prince 
andrew with a smile drew pierre attention to a commotion 
going on at the back porch a woman bent with 
age with a on her back and a short long 
young man in a black had rushed back to the 
on seeing the carriage up two women ran out after 
them and all four looking round at the carriage ran 
in dismay up the steps of the back porch  
 are mary  said prince andrew  have mistaken 
us for my father this is the one matter in 
which she him he orders these to be driven away 
but she them   what are  asked pierre 
 prince andrew had no time to answer the came 
out to meet them and he asked where the old 
prince was and whether he was expected back soon  
the old prince had gone to the town and was 
expected back any minute  prince andrew led pierre to 
his own apartments which were always kept in order and 
for him in his father house he himself went to 
the nursery   us go and see my sister 
he said to pierre when he returned  have not 
found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her 
 it will serve her right she will be confused 
but you will see her  it really very  
 are  asked pierre   and you see 
for yourself  princess mary really was disconcerted and red 
came on her face when they went in in her 
room with burning before the stand a young lad with 
a long nose and long hair wearing a sat on 
the sofa beside her behind a samovar near them in 
an armchair sat a thin old woman with a expression 
on her childlike face   why didn you warn 
me said the princess with reproach as she stood before 
her like a before her   de vous je 
tres de vous  she said to pierre as he 
kissed her hand she had known him as a child 
and now his friendship with andrew his with his wife 
and above all his kindly simple face disposed her favorably 
toward him she looked at him with her beautiful radiant 
eyes and seemed to say  like you very much 
but please don laugh at my people after exchanging the 
first greetings they sat down      
   to see you i am very glad 
to see you    and is here too 
said prince andrew glancing with a smile at the young 
  said princess mary imploringly  faut vous une 
femme  said prince andrew to pierre   au 
de dieu  princess mary repeated     
     must know that this is 
a woman         
 heaven sake   it was evident that prince 
andrew ironical tone toward the and princess mary to them 
were their long relations on the matter   ma 
bonne said prince andrew  au de a pierre  
         my 
dear you ought on the contrary to be grateful to 
     me for explaining to pierre 
your with this young      man 
   said pierre gazing over his spectacles with 
curiosity and  which princess mary was specially grateful to 
him into face who seeing that she was being spoken 
about looked round at them all with eyes  princess 
mary embarrassment on her people account was quite unnecessary they 
were not in the least the old woman lowering her 
eyes but side glances at the had turned her cup 
down and placed a bit of beside it and sat 
quietly in her armchair though to be offered another cup 
of tea out of her looked with sly eyes from 
under her brows at the young men   have 
you been to prince andrew asked the old woman

saint and now i from where a great and wonderful

face like the light of heaven and from the mother

 what are you saying exclaimed the turning to princess 
mary for support   impose on the people he 
repeated   exclaimed the woman crossing herself  don 
speak so there was a general who did not believe 
and said  and as soon as he said it

to him and said  in me and i will

to speak so god will you she said turning to 
pierre   did the star get into the pierre 
asked   was the mother to the rank of 
general said prince andrew with a smile  suddenly grew 
quite pale and clasped her hands   what a 
sin and you who have a son she began her 
suddenly turning to a red  what have you said 
god forgive you and she herself  forgive him my 
dear what does it mean she asked turning to princess 
mary she got up and almost crying began to arrange 
her she evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have in 
a house where such things could be said and was 
at the same time sorry to have now to the 
of this house   why need you do it 
said princess mary  did you come to me  
 i was said pierre  ma je l  
i did not mean anything i was only he said 
smiling and trying to his  was all my and 
andrew was only        
 on my word i did not wish to her 
  stopped but in pierre face there was such 
a look of sincere and prince andrew glanced so now 
at her and now at pierre that she was gradually 
     chapter xiv   the 
woman was and being to talk gave a long account 
of father who led so a life that his hands 
of and how on her last visit to some she 
knew let her have the of the and how she 
taking some with her had spent two days in the 
with the  to one then go on to another 
i sleep a bit and then again go and kiss 
the and there was such peace all around such that 
one don want to come out even into the light 
of heaven again  pierre listened to her attentively and 
seriously prince andrew went out of the room and then 
leaving  to finish their tea princess mary took pierre 
into the drawing room   are very kind she 
said to him   i really did not mean 
to hurt her i understand them so well and have 
the greatest respect for them  princess mary looked at 
him silently and smiled affectionately   have known you 
a long time you see and am as fond of 
you as of a brother she said  do you 
find andrew she added hurriedly not giving him time to 
reply to her affectionate words  am very anxious about 
him his health was better in the winter but last 
spring his wound and the doctor said he ought to 
go away for a and i am also very much 
afraid for him he has not a character like us 
women who when we suffer can away our he it 
all within him today he is cheerful and in good 
but that is the effect of your visit is not 
often like that if you could him to go abroad 
he and this quiet regular life is very bad for 
him others don notice it but i see it  
toward ten o the men rushed to the front door 
hearing the of the old prince carriage approaching prince andrew 
and pierre also went out into the porch   
that asked the old prince noticing pierre as he got 
out of the carriage   very glad kiss me 
he said having learned who the young stranger was  
the old prince was in a good and very gracious 
to pierre  before supper prince andrew coming back to 
his father study found him with his visitor pierre was 
that a time would come when there would be no 
more wars the old prince it but without getting angry 
  the blood from men and put in water 
instead then there will be no more war old women 
nonsense women nonsense he repeated but still he pierre affectionately 
on the shoulder and then went up to the table 
where prince andrew evidently not wishing to join in the 
conversation was looking over the papers his father had brought 
from town the old prince went up to him and 
began to talk business   a count rostov hasn 
sent half his he came to town and wanted to 
invite me to dinner gave him a pretty dinner and 
there look at this well my boy the old prince 
went on addressing his son and patting pierre on the 
shoulder  fine fellow friend like him he me up 
another says clever things and one doesn care to listen 
but this one yet an old fellow up well go 
get along perhaps i come and sit with you at 
supper we have another make friends with my little fool 
princess mary he shouted after pierre through the door  
only now on his visit to bald hills did pierre 
fully the strength and of his friendship with prince andrew 
that was not expressed so much in his relations with 
him as with all his family and with the household 
with the stern old prince and the gentle timid princess 
mary though he had scarcely known them pierre at once 
felt like an old friend they were all fond of 
him already not only princess mary who had been won 
by his with the gave him her most radiant looks 
but even the one  nicholas  his called him 
smiled at pierre and let himself be taken in his 
arms and michael and mademoiselle looked at him with pleasant 
smiles when he talked to the old prince  the 
old prince came in to supper this was evidently on 
pierre account and during the two days of the young 
man visit he was kind to him and told him 
to visit them again  when pierre had gone and 
the members of the household met together they began to 
express their opinions of him as people always do after 
a new acquaintance has left but as happens no one 
said anything but what was good of him   
   chapter xv   when returning from 
his leave rostov felt for the first time how close 
was the that him to and the whole regiment  
on approaching it rostov felt as he had done when 
approaching his home in moscow when he saw the first 
hussar with the uniform of his regiment when he recognized 
red and saw the of the horses when shouted to 
his  count has come and who had been on 
his bed ran all out of the to embrace him 
and the officers round to the new arrival rostov experienced 
the same feeling as when his mother his father and 
his sister had embraced him and tears of joy him 
so that he could not speak the regiment was also 
a home and as dear and precious as his parents 
house  when he had himself to the commander of 
the regiment and had been to his former had been 
on duty and had gone out when he had again 
entered into all the little interests of the regiment and 
felt himself of liberty and in one unchanging frame he 
experienced the same sense of peace of support and the 
same sense of being at home here in his own 
place as he had felt under the but here was 
none of all that of the world at large where 
he did not know his right place and took mistaken 
decisions here was no sonya with whom he ought or 
ought not to have an here was no of going 
there or not going there here there were not twenty 
hours in the day which could be spent in such 
a of there was not that crowd of people of 
whom not one was nearer to him or farther from 
him than another there were none of those uncertain and 
money relations with his father and nothing to that terrible 
to dolokhov here in the regiment all was clear and 
simple the whole world was divided into two one our 
pavlograd regiment the other all the rest and the rest 
was no of his in the regiment everything was definite 
who was lieutenant who captain who was a good fellow 
who a bad one and most of all who was 
a the gave one one pay came every four months 
there was nothing to think out or decide you had 
only to do nothing that was considered bad in the 
pavlograd regiment and when given an order to do what 
was clearly distinctly and ordered all would be well  
having once more entered into the definite of this life 
rostov felt the joy and relief a tired man on 
lying down to rest life in the regiment during this 
was all the for him because after his to dolokhov 
 which in spite of all his family to console 
him he could not forgive himself he had made up 
his mind to for his by serving not as he 
had done before but really well and by being a 
perfectly first and officer a word a splendid man a 
thing which seemed so difficult out in the world but 
so possible in the regiment  after his he had 
determined to pay back his to his parents in five 
years he received ten thousand rubles a year but now 
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to 
the to his parents  our army after repeated and 
and at and was concentrated near it was awaiting the 
emperor arrival and the beginning of a new  the 
pavlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which 
had served in the  had been recruiting up to 
strength in russia and arrived too late to take part 
in the first actions of the it had been neither 
at nor at and when it joined the army in 
the field in the second half of the was attached

the pavlograd regiment had exchanged with the had taken prisoners 
and once had even captured carriages in the were for 
some near a and deserted german village  a had 
set in it was and cold the ice on the 
river broke and the became for days neither for the 
men nor for the horses had been as no could 
arrive the men dispersed about the and deserted searching for 
but found few even of these  everything had been 
up and the had all fled any remained they were 
worse than and nothing more could be taken from them 
even the soldiers usually enough instead of taking anything from 
them often gave them the last of their  the 
pavlograd regiment had had only two men in but had 
lost nearly half its men from and in the death 
was so certain that soldiers suffering from or the that 
came from bad food to remain on duty and hardly 
able to their legs went to the front rather than 
to the when spring came on the soldiers found a 
plant just showing out of the ground that looked like 
which for some reason they called  sweet root it 
was very but they about the it and it out 
with their and ate it though they were ordered not 
to do so as it was a plant that spring 
a new broke out among the soldiers a of the 
arms legs and face which the doctors to this root 
but in spite of all this the soldiers of chiefly 
on  sweet root because it was the second week 
that the last of the were being out at the 
rate of half a a man and the last received 
had and  the horses also had been for a 
on straw from the and had become thin though still 
covered with of winter hair  despite this the soldiers 
and officers went on living just as usual despite their 
pale faces and tattered the hussars formed line for call 
kept things in order their horses polished their arms brought 
in straw from the in place of and sat down 
to dine round the from which they rose up about 
their food and their as usual in their spare time 
they lit themselves before them smoked picked out and told 
and listened to stories of and suvorov or to of 
the sly or the  the officers as usual lived 
in and in the half the tried to straw and 
and in general food for the men the younger ones 
occupied themselves as before some playing cards  was of 
money though there was no food some with more innocent 
games such as and the general of the was spoken 
of because nothing certain was known about it because there 
was a feeling that in the main it was going 
badly  rostov lived as before with and since their 
they had become more friendly than ever never spoke of 
rostov family but by the tender friendship his commander showed 
him rostov felt that the elder hussar love for natasha 
played a part in their friendship evidently tried to rostov 
to danger as as possible and after an greeted his 
safe return with evident joy on one of his in 
a deserted and village to which he had come in 
search of rostov found a family of an old pole 
and his daughter with an in arms they were half 
too weak to get away on foot and had no 
means of a rostov brought them to his placed them 
in his own and kept them for some while the 
old man was one of his comrades talking of women 
began rostov saying that he was more than any of 
them and that it would not be a bad thing 
if he introduced to them the pretty girl he had 
rostov took the joke as an up and said such 
unpleasant things to the officer that it was all could 
do to prevent a when the officer had gone away 
who did not himself know what rostov relations with the 
girl might be began to him for his quickness of 
and rostov replied   what you like she is 
like a sister to me and i can tell you 
how it offended me because well for that reason  
him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room 
without looking at rostov as was his way at moments 
of deep feeling   what a mad you are 
he muttered and rostov noticed tears in his eyes  
    chapter xvi   in the 
were by news of the emperor arrival but rostov had 
no of being present at the he held at as 
the were at the far that place  they were 
and rostov were living in an earth out for them 
by the soldiers and with branches and the was made 
in the following manner which had then come into vogue 
a was three and a half feet wide four feet 
eight inches deep and eight feet long at one end 
of the steps were cut out and these formed the 
entrance and the itself was the room in which the 
ones such as the commander had a board lying on 
at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a 
table on each side of the the earth was cut 
out to a of about two and a half feet 
and this did duty for and the was so that 
one could stand up in the middle of the and 
could even sit up on the if one drew close 
to the table who was living because the soldiers of 
his liked him had also a board in the at 
the farther end with a piece of  but glass 
in it for a window when it was very cold 
from the soldiers were placed on a bent of iron 
on the steps in the  room called that part 
of the it was then so warm that the officers 
of whom there were always some with and rostov sat 
in their shirt sleeves  in rostov was on duty 
one morning between seven and eight returning after a night 
he sent for changed his rain said his drank tea 
got warm then up the things on the table and 
in his own corner and his face from to the 
wind and with nothing on but his shirt lay down 
on his back putting his arms under his head he 
was considering the of being in a few days for 
his last expedition and was awaiting who had gone out 
somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk  suddenly 
he heard shouting in a voice behind the evidently much 
rostov moved to the window to see whom he was 
speaking to and saw the   ordered you not 
to let them eat that was shouting  i saw 
with my own eyes how some the   have 
given the order again and again your honor but they 
don obey answered the  rostov lay down again on 
his bed and thought complacently  him and now my 
job done and i lying down he could hear that 
sly bold of talking as well as the was saying 
something about and he had seen when he had gone 
out for  then voice was heard shouting farther and 
farther away  second   are they off to 
now thought rostov  five minutes later came into the 
climbed with on the bed lit his pipe his things 
about took his on his saber and went out again 
in answer to rostov inquiry where he was going he 
answered and crossly that he had some business   
god and our monarch judge me afterwards said going out 
and rostov heard the of several horses through the he 
did not even trouble to find out where had gone 
having got warm in his corner he fell and did 
not leave the till toward evening had not yet returned 
the weather had up and near the next two officers 
and a cadet were playing laughing as they threw their 
which themselves in the soft rostov joined them in the 
middle of the game the officers saw some approaching with 
fifteen hussars on their horses behind them the by the 
hussars drew up to the and a crowd of hussars 
them   now has been said rostov  here 
are the   they are said the officers  
the soldiers be glad  a little behind the hussars 
came accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was 
talking  rostov went to meet them   warn 
you captain one of the officers a short thin man 
evidently very angry was saying   i told you 
i won give them up replied   will answer 
for it captain it is the of one own army 
our men have had nothing to eat for two days 
  mine have had nothing for two said

infantry officer raising his voice   what are you

till you get hurt be off go he shouted at 
the officers   well then shouted the little officer

well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning his 
horse he away in his   dog a a

to a and up to rostov he burst out laughing 
  taken from the by force he said  
all can let our men  the that had reached 
the hussars had been to an infantry regiment but learning 
from that the was with his hussars had seized it 
by force the soldiers had out to them and they 
even them with the other  the next day the 
commander sent for and holding his fingers spread out before 
his eyes said   is how i look at 
this affair i know nothing about it and won begin 
but i advise you to ride over to the staff 
and the business there in the department and if possible 
sign a for such and such received if not as 
the demand was against an infantry regiment there will be 
a row and the affair may end badly  from 
the commander straight to the staff with a sincere desire 
to act on this advice in the evening he came 
back to his in a state such as rostov had 
never yet seen him in could not speak and for 
when rostov asked what was the matter he only uttered 
some and in a voice  alarmed at condition rostov 
suggested that he should drink some water and send for 
the doctor   me for oh some more water 
let them me but i always and i tell the 
ice he muttered  the doctor when he came said 
it was absolutely necessary to a deep of black blood 
was taken from his arm and only then was he 
able to what had happened to him   get 
there began  then where your chief they were pointed 
out  to wait  twenty and have duties to 
attend to and no time to wait announce me well 
so out comes their head chief took it into his 
head to me  i say  not done by

but your affair will be passed on to i go 
to the i enter and at the table who do

arm so that the table nearly broke down and the 
on it jumped about   so it you who

fun i can tell you cried and yet angry his 
white teeth showing under his black mustache  have killed

you shouting for calm yourself said rostov  set your 
arm wait we must tie it up again  was 
up again and put to bed next day he calm 
and cheerful  but at the adjutant of the regiment 
came into rostov and with a grave and serious face 
and showed them a paper addressed to major from the 
commander in which were made about yesterday the adjutant told 
them that the affair was likely to take a very 
bad turn that a court had been appointed and that 
in of the severity with which and were now regarded 
to the ranks would be the best that could be 
for  the case as by the offended parties was 
that after the major being drunk went to the chief 
and without any called him a to him and on 
being led out had rushed into the and given two 
a and the arm of one of them  in 
answer to rostov questions said laughing that he thought he 
remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in 
it but that it was all nonsense and and he 
did not in the least fear any kind of and 
that if those dared attack him he would give them 
an answer that they would not easily forget  spoke 
contemptuously of the whole matter but rostov knew him too 
well not to that  hiding it from others at 
heart he feared a court and was over the affair 
which was evidently taking a bad turn every day of 
inquiry and notices from the court arrived and on the 
first of may was ordered to hand the over to 
the next in and appear before the staff of his 
to explain his violence at the on the previous day 
with two cossack and two of hussars as was his 
out in front of the his courage a by a 
french hit him in the part of his perhaps at 
another time would not have left the regiment for so 
slight a wound but now he took of it to 
excuse himself from at the staff and went into hospital 
     chapter xvii   in 
the battle of was fought in which the did not 
take part and after that an was rostov who felt 
his friend very much having no news of him since 
he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and 
the progress of his affairs took of the to get 
leave to visit in hospital  the hospital was in 
a small prussian town that had been twice by russian 
and french because it was summer when it is so 
beautiful out in the the little town a particularly appearance 
with its broken and its tattered and the and drunken 
soldiers about  the hospital was in a building with 
some of the window frames and broken and a courtyard 
by the remains of a that had been pulled to 
several soldiers with pale faces were sitting or about in 
the in the yard  rostov entered the door he 
was by a smell of and hospital air on the 
stairs he met a russian army doctor smoking a the 
doctor was followed by a russian   can tear 
myself to the doctor was saying  to in the 
evening i shall be there  the asked some further 
questions   do the best you can isn it 
all the same the doctor noticed rostov coming upstairs  
 do you want sir said the doctor  do 
you want the having spared you do you want to 
try this is a sir   so asked rostov 
  sir it death to go in only we 
two and i  pointed to the  on here 
some five of us doctors have died in this place 
when a new one comes he is done for in 
a week said the doctor with evident satisfaction  doctors 
have been here but our don like it at all 
 rostov explained that he wanted to see major of 
the hussars who was   don know i can 
tell you sir only think i am alone in of 
three with more than four hundred it well that the 
prussian ladies send us two pounds of and some each 
month or we should be lost he laughed  hundred 
sir and they always sending me fresh ones there are 
four hundred eh he asked turning to the  the 
looked out he was evidently vexed and impatient for the 
doctor to go   rostov said again  was 
at   i fancy eh the doctor in a 
tone of indifference  the however did not the doctor 
words   he tall and with hair asked the 
doctor  rostov described appearance   was one like 
that said the doctor as if pleased  one is 
dead i fancy however i look up our list we 
had a list have you got it   has 
the list answered the  if you step into the 
officers you see for yourself he added turning to rostov 
  you better not go sir said the doctor 
 you may have to stay here yourself  but 
rostov bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the 
to show him the way   don me the 
doctor shouted up after him  rostov and the went 
into the dark the smell was so strong there that 
rostov held his nose and had to pause and his 
strength before he could go on a door opened to 
the right and an sallow man on and in out 
and against the looked with envious eyes at those who 
were passing glancing in at the door rostov saw that 
the and were lying on the floor on straw and 
  i go in and look   is 
there to see said the  but just because the 
evidently did not want him to go in rostov entered 
the soldiers the air to which he had already to 
get used in the was still here it was a 
little different more and one felt that this was where 
it  in the long room lit up by the 
sun through the large the and lay in two rows 
with their heads to the and leaving a passage in 
the middle most of them were and paid no attention 
to the those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted 
their thin faces and all looked at rostov with the 
same expression of hope of relief reproach and of another 
health rostov went to the middle of the room and 
looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms 
saw the same thing there he stood still looking silently 
around he had not at all expected such a sight 
just before him almost across the middle of the passage 
on the bare floor lay a man probably a cossack 
to judge by the cut of his hair the man 
lay on his back his huge arms and legs his 
face was his eyes were rolled back so that only 
the were seen and on his bare legs and arms 
which were still red the stood out like he was 
the back of his head against the floor uttering some 
word which he kept repeating rostov listened and made out 
the word it was  drink a drink rostov glanced 
round looking for someone who would put this man back 
in his place and bring him water   looks 
after the here he asked the  just then a 
a hospital came in from the next room and drew 
up in front of rostov   day your honor 
he shouted rolling his eyes at rostov and evidently him 
for one of the hospital   him to his 
place and give him some water said rostov pointing to 
the cossack   your honor the replied complacently and 
rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up 
still but did not move   it impossible to 
do anything here thought rostov lowering his eyes and he 
was going out but became aware of an look fixed 
on him on his right and he turned close to 
the corner on an sat an old gray as thin 
as a with a stern sallow face and eyes fixed 
on rostov the man on one side whispered something to 
him pointing at rostov who noticed that the old man 
wanted to speak to him he drew nearer and saw 
that the old man had only one bent under him 
the other had been above the knee his on the 
other side who lay some distance from him with his 
head thrown back was a young with a nose his 
pale face was still and his eyes were rolled back 
rostov looked at the young and a cold ran down 
his back   this one seems he began turning 
to the   how we been begging your honor 
said the old his quivering  been dead since morning 
after all we men not dogs   send someone 
at once he shall be taken away away at once 
said the hurriedly  us go your honor   
yes let us go said rostov hastily and lowering his 
eyes and he tried to pass between the rows of 
envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out 
of the room      chapter xviii 
  going along the the led rostov to the 
officers of three rooms the doors of which stood open 
there were in these rooms and the and officers were 
lying or sitting on them some were about the rooms 
in hospital the first person rostov met in the officers 
was a thin little man with one arm who was 
about the first room in a and hospital gown with 
a pipe between his teeth rostov looked at him trying 
to remember where he had seen him before   
where we met again said the little man  don 
you remember who gave you a lift at and i 
had a bit cut off you see he went on 
with a smile pointing to the empty sleeve of his 
gown  for vasili my he added when he heard 
who rostov wanted  here and led him into the 
next room from came sounds of several laughing voices  
 can they laugh or even live at all here 
thought rostov still aware of that smell of that had 
been so strong in the soldiers and still to see 
fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him 
out from both sides and the face of that young 
with eyes rolled back  lay on his bed with 
his head under the though it was nearly   
how are you how are you he called out still 
in the same voice as in the regiment but rostov 
noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some 
new feeling showed itself in the expression of face and 
the of his voice  his wound though a slight 
one had not yet even now six after he had 
been hit his face had the same as the faces 
of the other hospital but it was not this that 
struck rostov what struck him was that did not seem 
glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally he 
did not ask about the regiment nor about the general 
state of affairs and when rostov spoke of these matters 
did not listen  rostov even noticed that did not 
like to be reminded of the regiment or in general 
of that other free life which was going on outside 
the hospital he seemed to try to forget that old 
life and was only interested in the affair with the 
officers on rostov inquiry as to how the matter stood 
he at once produced from under his a paper he 
had received from the and the rough of his answer 
to it he became animated when he began reading his 
paper and specially drew rostov attention to the stinging he 
made to his his hospital who had gathered round rostov 
fresh arrival from the world outside began to as soon 
as began reading his answer rostov noticed by their faces 
that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more 
than once and were tired of it only the man 
who had the next bed a stout continued to sit 
on his bed frowning and smoking a pipe and little 
one still listened shaking his head in the middle of 
the reading the interrupted   what i say is 
he said turning to rostov  would be best simply 
to the emperor for they say great will now be 
distributed and a would be   the exclaimed in 
a voice to which he tried hard to give the 
old energy and fire but which sounded like an expression 
of  for if i were a i would ask 
mercy but i being court for to book let them 
me i not of anyone i served the and my 
and have not and am i to be listen i

  i said i not going to interrupted him 
went on reading his paper  rostov had not the 
courage to though he felt that the way by and 
the other officers was the and though he would have 
been glad to be of service to he knew his 
will and  when the reading of virulent reply which 
took more than an hour was over rostov said nothing 
and he spent the rest of the day in a 
most state of mind amid hospital comrades who had gathered 
round him telling them what he knew and listening to 
their stories was silent all the evening  late in 
the evening when rostov was about to leave he asked 
whether he had no for him   wait a 
bit said glancing round at the officers and taking his 
papers from under his he went to the window where 
he had an and sat down to write   
seems it no use one head against a wall he 
said coming from the window and giving rostov a large 
in it was the to the emperor drawn up by 
the in which without to the of the simply asked 
for   it in it seems  he did 
not finish but gave a unnatural smile    
  chapter xix   having returned to the 
regiment and told the commander the state of affairs rostov 
to with the letter to the emperor  on the 
of the french and russian arrived in boris had asked 
the important on whom he was in to include him 
in the appointed for the stay at   should 
like to see the great man he said to napoleon 
whom he like everyone else had always called buonaparte  
 are speaking of buonaparte asked the general smiling  
boris looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that 
he was being   am speaking prince of the 
emperor napoleon he replied the general him on the shoulder 
with a smile   will go far he said 
and took him to with him  boris was among 
the few present at the on the day the two 
met he saw the decorated with saw napoleon pass before 
the french guards on the farther bank of the river 
saw the face of the emperor alexander as he sat 
in silence in a on the bank of the awaiting 
napoleon arrival saw both get into boats and saw how 
napoleon the first quickly forward to meet alexander and held 
out his hand to him and how they both into 
the since he had to move in the highest boris 
had made it his habit to watch attentively all that 
went on around him and to note it down at 
the time of the meeting at he asked the of 
those who had come with napoleon and about the they 
wore and listened attentively to words spoken by important at 
the moment the went into the he looked at his 
watch and did not forget to look at it again 
when alexander came out the interview had an hour and 
fifty minutes he noted this down that same evening among 
other he felt to be of importance as the emperor 
was a very small one it was a matter of 
great importance for a man who his success in the 
service to be at on the occasion of this interview 
between the two and having succeeded in this boris felt 
that his position was fully he had not only become 
known but people had grown accustomed to him and him 
twice he had to the emperor himself so that the 
latter knew his face and all those at court far 
from cold him as at first when they considered him 
a would now have been surprised had he been absent 
 boris with another adjutant the count a pole brought 
up in paris was rich and passionately fond of the 
french and almost every day of the stay at french 
officers of the and from french were dining and with 
him and boris  on the evening of the twenty 
of count arranged a supper for his french friends the 
of honor was an aide of napoleon there were also 
several french officers of the and a page of napoleon 
a young lad of an old french family that same 
day rostov by the to avoid being recognized in civilian 
dress came to and went to the occupied by boris 
and  rostov in common with the whole army from 
which he came was far from having experienced the change 
of feeling toward napoleon and the french from being had 
suddenly become friends had taken place at and in boris 
in the army bonaparte and the french were still regarded 
with mingled of anger and fear only recently talking with 
one of cossack officers rostov had that if napoleon were 
taken he would be treated not as a sovereign but 
as a quite lately to meet a french colonel on 
the road rostov had with heat that peace was impossible 
between a sovereign and the bonaparte rostov was therefore struck 
by the presence of french officers in boris dressed in 
he had been accustomed to see from quite a different 
point of from the of the as soon as he 
noticed a french officer who thrust his head out of 
the door that feeling of which he always experienced at 
the sight of the suddenly seized him he stopped at 
the and asked in russian whether lived there boris hearing 
a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet 
him an expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment 
on his face on first rostov   it you 
very glad very glad to see you he said however 
coming toward him with a smile but rostov had noticed 
his first impulse   come at a bad time 
i think i should not have come but i have 
business he said coldly   i only wonder how 
you managed to get away from your regiment un moment 
je a vous  he said answering someone who called 
him         a 
minute i shall be at your disposal    
see i rostov repeated  the look of annoyance had 
already from boris face having evidently reflected and decided how 
to act he very quietly took both rostov hands and 
led him into the next room his eyes looking and 
steadily at rostov seemed to be veiled by something as 
if by blue spectacles of so it seemed to rostov 
  come now as if you could come at 
a wrong time said boris and he led him into 
the room where the supper table was laid and introduced 
him to his guests explaining that he was not a 
civilian but an hussar officer and an old friend of 
his   said he his guests rostov looked at 
the bowed reluctantly and remained silent  evidently did not 
receive this new russian person very willingly into his circle 
and did not speak to rostov boris did not appear 
to notice the the produced and with the same pleasant 
and the same veiled look in his eyes with which 
he had met rostov tried to the conversation one of 
the with the politeness of his addressed the rostov saying 
that the latter had probably come to to see the 
emperor   i came on business replied rostov  
rostov had been out of from the moment he noticed 
the look of on boris face and as always happens 
to those in a bad it seemed to him that 
everyone regarded him with and that he was in everybody 
way he really was in their way for he alone 
took no part in the conversation which again became general 
the looks the visitors on him seemed to say  
what is he sitting here for he rose and went 
up to boris   i in your way he 
said in a low tone  and talk over my 
business and i go away   no not at 
all said boris  if you are tired come and 
lie down in my room and have a rest  
 really  they went into the little room where 
boris rostov without sitting down began at once  if 
boris were to in some way telling him about affair 
asking him whether through his general he could and would 
with the emperor on behalf and get in when he 
and boris were alone rostov felt for the first time 
that he could not look boris in the face without 
a sense of awkwardness boris with one over the other 
and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of 
his right listened to rostov as a general to the 
report of a now looking aside and now gazing straight 
into rostov eyes with the same veiled look each time 
this happened rostov felt uncomfortable and down his eyes  
 have heard of such and know that his majesty 
is very severe in such affairs i think it would 
be best not to bring it before the emperor but 
to apply to the commander of the corps but in 
general i think   you don want to do 
anything well then say so rostov almost shouted not looking 
boris in the face  boris smiled   the 
contrary i will do what i can only i thought 
 at that moment voice was heard calling boris  
 then go go go said rostov and supper and 
remaining alone in the little room he walked up and 
down for a long time hearing the french conversation from 
the next room      chapter xx 
  rostov had come to the day least for 
a on behalf he could not himself go to the 
general in as he was in and had come to 
without to do so and boris even had he wished 
to could not have done so on the following day 
on that day  the of peace were the exchanged 
alexander received the cross of the of honor and napoleon 
the order of st andrew of the first degree and 
a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by 
a of the french guards to the the were to 
be present at that  rostov felt so ill at 
ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the latter looked 
in after supper he pretended to be and early next 
morning went away boris in his civilian clothes and a 
round hat he about the town staring at the french 
and their and at the and where the russian and 
french were staying in a square he saw tables being 
set up and made for the dinner he saw the 
russian and french colors from side to side of the 
with huge a and in the of the also and 
were   doesn want to help me and i 
don want to ask him that settled thought nicholas  
is over between us but i won leave here without 
having done all i can for and certainly not without 
getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is 
here thought rostov who had returned to the house where 
alexander  horses were standing before the house and the 
were evidently preparing for the emperor to come out  
 may see him at any moment thought rostov  
only i were to hand the letter direct to him 
and tell him all could they really me for my 
civilian clothes not he would understand on whose side lies 
he everything knows everything who can be more just more 
than he and even if they did me for being 
here what would it matter thought he looking at an 
officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied  
all people do go in it all nonsense i go 
in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so 
much the worse for who me to it and suddenly 
with a he himself did not expect rostov felt for 
the letter in his and went straight to the house 
  i won miss my opportunity now as i 
did after he thought expecting every moment to meet the 
monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed to his 
heart at the thought  will fall at his feet 
and him he will lift me up will listen and 
will even thank me  am happy when i can 
do good but to is the greatest happiness rostov the 
sovereign saying and passing people who looked after him with 
curiosity he entered the porch of the emperor house  
a broad staircase led straight up from the and to 
the right he saw a closed door below under the 
staircase was a door leading to the lower floor  
 do you want someone inquired   hand in 
a letter a to his majesty said nicholas with a 
in his voice   this way to the officer 
on duty  was shown the door leading downstairs  
it won be  on hearing this indifferent voice rostov 
grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of 
meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and 
so that he was ready to run away but the 
official who had him opened the door and rostov entered 
 a short stout man of about thirty in white 
breeches and high and a shirt that he had evidently 
only just put on standing in that room and his 
was on to the back of his breeches a new 
pair of handsome silk that for some reason rostov attention 
this man was speaking to someone in the adjoining room 
  good figure and in her first he was 
saying but on seeing rostov he stopped short and frowned 
  is it a   is it asked 
the person in the other room   answered the 
man with the   him to come later he 
be coming out we must go   later tomorrow 
it too late  rostov turned and was about to 
go but the man in the stopped him   
have you come from who are you   come 
from major answered rostov   you an officer  
 count rostov   hand it in through your 
commander and go along with you go and he continued 
to put on the uniform the him  rostov went 
back into the hall and noticed that in the porch 
there were many officers and in full uniform whom he 
had to pass  his his heart at the thought 
of finding himself at any moment face to face with 
the emperor and being put to shame and in his 
presence fully now to the of his conduct and of 
it rostov with eyes was making his way out of 
the house through the brilliant when a familiar voice called 
him and a hand detained him   are you 
doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice 
 it was a cavalry general who had obtained the 
emperor special favor during this and who had the in 
which rostov was serving  rostov in dismay began himself 
but seeing the kindly face of the general he took 
him aside and in an voice told him the whole 
affair asking him to for whom the general knew having 
heard rostov to the end the general shook his head 
gravely   sorry sorry for that fine fellow give 
me the letter  hardly had rostov him the letter 
and finished explaining case when steps and the of spurs 
were heard on the stairs and the general leaving him 
went to the porch the gentlemen of the emperor ran 
down the stairs and went to their horses the same 
who had been at led up the emperor horse and 
the faint creak of a rostov knew at once was 
heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized 
rostov went close to the porch together with some and 
again after two years saw those features he adored that 
same face and same look and step and the same 
of majesty and mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and 
love for his sovereign rose again in rostov soul in 
all its old force in the uniform of the regiment 
breeches and high wearing a star rostov did not know 
 was that of the d the monarch came out 
into the porch putting on his gloves and carrying his 
hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him 
everything around by his glance he spoke a few words 
to some of the and the former commander of rostov 
smiled and to him  all the drew back and 
rostov saw the general talking for some time to the 
emperor  the emperor said a few words to him 
and took a step toward his horse again the crowd 
of members of the and street  whom was rostov 
moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with 
his hand on the the emperor turned to the cavalry 
general and said in a loud voice evidently wishing to 
be heard by all   cannot do it general 
i cannot because the law is than i and he 
raised his foot to the  the general bowed his 
head respectfully and the monarch and down the street at 
a beside himself with enthusiasm rostov ran after him with 
the crowd      chapter   
the emperor to the square where facing one another a 
of the regiment stood on the right and a of 
the french guards in their on the left  as 
the up to one of the which arms another group 
of up to the opposite and at the head of 
them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else 
he came at a wearing a small hat a blue 
uniform open over a white and the st andrew ribbon 
over his shoulder he was a very fine gray horse 
with a crimson gold on approaching alexander he raised his 
hat and as he did so rostov with his eye 
could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well 
or firmly in the the shouted  and  l 
napoleon said something to alexander and both and took each 
other hands napoleon face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile 
alexander was saying something to him  in spite of 
the of the french horses which were pushing back the 
crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander 
and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander 
treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was 
quite at ease with the as if such relations with 
an emperor were an matter to him  alexander and 
napoleon with the long train of their approached the right 
of the and came straight up to the crowd standing 
there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the 
that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he 
might be recognized   i ask your to present 
the of honor to the of your soldiers said a 
sharp voice every letter  this was said by the 
napoleon looking up straight into alexander eyes alexander listened attentively 
to what was said to him and bending his head 
smiled   him who has himself most in this 
last war added napoleon each syllable as with a and 
assurance to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian 
ranks drawn up before him who all arms with their 
eyes fixed on their emperor   your majesty allow 
me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a 
few steps toward prince the commander of the  bonaparte 
meanwhile began taking the off his small white hand it 
in doing so and threw it away an aide behind 
him rushed forward and picked it up   whom 
shall it be given the emperor alexander asked in russian 
in a low voice   your majesty commands  
the emperor his brows with and glancing back remarked  
 we must give him an answer  scanned the 
ranks and rostov in his   it be me 
thought rostov   the colonel called with a frown 
and the first in the rank stepped briskly forward  
 are you off to stop here voices whispered to 
who did not know where to go stopped a look 
at his colonel in alarm his face as often happens 
to soldiers called before the ranks  napoleon slightly turned 
his head and put his plump little hand out behind 
him as if to take something the members of his 
at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as 
they passed something from one to another and a page 
same one rostov had seen the previous evening at boris 
forward and respectfully over the hand and not keeping it 
waiting a moment laid in it an order on a 
red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers together and 
the badge was between them then he approached  rolled 
his eyes and gazed at his own monarch looked round 
at the emperor alexander to that what he was now 
doing was done for the sake of his and the 
small white hand holding the order touched one of buttons 
it was as if napoleon knew that it was only 
necessary for his hand to to touch that breast for 
the to be forever happy and distinguished from everyone else 
in the world napoleon merely laid the cross on breast 
and dropping his hand turned toward alexander as though sure 
that the cross would there and it really did  
hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and it 
to the uniform glanced at the little man with white 
hands who was doing something to him and still standing 
presenting arms looked again straight into alexander eyes as if 
asking whether he should stand there or go away or 
do something else but receiving no orders he remained for 
some time in that position  the and away the 
breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down 
at the tables prepared for them  sat in the 
place of honor russian and french officers embraced him him 
and pressed his hands of officers and drew near merely 
to see him a of russian and french voices and 
laughter filled the air round the tables in the square 
two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed 
by rostov   d think of the treat all 
on silver plate one of them was saying  you 
seen   have   i hear the will 
give them a dinner   but what luck for 
twelve hundred for life   a cap shouted a 
a french cap   a fine thing first  
 you heard the asked one guards officer of another 
 day before yesterday it was  france yesterday  
one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon 
tomorrow our emperor will send a st george cross to 
the of the french guards it has to be done 
he must in kind  boris too with his friend 
came to see the on his way back he noticed 
rostov standing by the corner of a house   
how d do we one another he said and could 
not refrain from asking what was the matter so and 
was rostov face   nothing replied rostov   
call round   i will  rostov stood at 
that corner for a long time watching the from a 
distance in his mind a painful process was going on 
which he could not bring to a terrible rose in 
his soul now he remembered with his changed expression his 
and the whole hospital with arms and legs off and 
its and so did he that hospital of dead that 
he looked round to see where the smell came from 
next he thought of that self bonaparte with his small 
white hand who was now an emperor liked and respected 
by alexander then why those arms and legs and those 
dead men then again he thought of and and he 
caught himself such strange thoughts that he was frightened  
the smell of the food the were and a sense 
of recalled him from these reflections he had to get 
something to eat before going away he went to a 
he had noticed that morning there he found so many 
people among them officers who like himself had come in 
civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a dinner 
two officers of his own joined him the conversation naturally 
turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most 
of the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after 
the battle of they said that had we held out 
a little longer napoleon would have been done for as 
his had neither nor nicholas ate and drank  the 
latter in silence he finished a of bottles of wine 
by himself the process in his mind went on him 
without reaching a he feared to give way to his 
thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on 
one of the officers saying that it was humiliating to 
look at the french rostov began shouting with and therefore 
much to the surprise of the officers   can 
you judge what best he cried the blood suddenly rushing 
to his face  can you judge the emperor actions 
what right have we to we cannot either the emperor 
or his actions   i never said a word 
about the emperor said the officer himself and unable to 
understand rostov outburst except on the that he was drunk 
 but rostov did not listen to him   
are not we are soldiers and nothing more he went 
on  we are ordered to die we must die 
if we it means that we have deserved it it 
not for us to judge if the emperor to recognize 
bonaparte as emperor and to an alliance with him it 
means that that is the right thing to do if 
once we begin and arguing about everything nothing will be 
left that way we shall be saying there is no 
god shouted nicholas banging the table little to the point 
as it seemed to his but quite to the course 
of his own thoughts   business is to do 
our duty to fight and not to think that all 
said he   to drink said one of the 
officers not wishing to   and to drink nicholas 
 there another bottle he shouted  in  the 
emperor alexander went to for a fresh interview with the 
emperor napoleon and in the upper of petersburg there was 
much talk of the of this important meeting   
   chapter   in  the between 
 world two as napoleon and alexander were called was 
such that when napoleon declared war on austria a russian 
corps the to with our old bonaparte against our old 
the emperor of austria and in court the of between 
napoleon and one of alexander sisters was spoken of but 
besides of foreign the attention of russian society was at 
that time on the that were being in all the 
of government  life meanwhile life with its essential interests 
of health and and rest and its intellectual interests in 
thought science music love friendship hatred and on as usual 
of and apart from political friendship or with napoleon bonaparte 
and from all the of      
book six         
chapter i   prince andrew had spent two years 
in the country  all the pierre had on his 
estates constantly changing from one thing to another had never 
accomplished carried out by prince andrew without display and without 
perceptible difficulty  he had in the highest degree a 
practical which pierre lacked and without or strain on his 
part this set things going  on one of his 
estates the three hundred serfs were and became free being 
one of the first of the kind in russia on 
other estates the serfs was for a a was engaged 
for at his and a was paid to reading and 
to the children of the and household serfs  prince 
andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his 
father and his son who was still in the care 
of the other half he spent in  as his 
father called prince andrew despite the indifference to the affairs 
of the world he had expressed to pierre he followed 
all that went on received many and to his surprise 
noticed that when he or his father had visitors from 
petersburg the very of life these people behind himself never 
left the country knowledge of what was in home and 
foreign affairs  besides being occupied with his estates and 
reading a great of prince andrew was at this time 
busy with a of our last two unfortunate and with 
drawing up a for a reform of the army and 
 in the spring of  he went to visit 
the estates which had been by his son whose he 
was  by the spring he sat in the looking 
at the new grass the first leaves on the and 
the first of white spring across the clear blue sky 
he was not thinking of anything but looked absent and 
from side to side  they the where he had 
talked with pierre the year before they went through the 
village past and green of winter where snow still near 
the bridge where the had been by the rain past 
of land and touched with green here and there and 
into a forest growing on both sides of the road 
in the forest it was almost hot no wind could 
be felt the with their green leaves were and flowers 
and the first of green grass were pushing up and 
lifting last year leaves the coarse color of the small 
here and there among the was an unpleasant of winter 
on entering the forest the horses began to and  
peter the footman made some remark to the the latter 
but apparently the sympathy was not enough for peter and 
he turned on the box toward his   pleasant 
it is your excellency he said with a smile  
   pleasant your excellency   is he 
talking about thought prince andrew  the spring i suppose 
he thought as he turned round  really everything is 
green already how early the and and too are coming 
out but the show no sign yet ah here is 
one oak   at the edge of the road 
stood an oak probably ten times the age of the 
that formed the forest it was ten times as thick 
and twice as tall as they it was an enormous 
tree its twice as great as a man could embrace 
and evidently long ago some of its branches had been 
broken off and its with its huge ungainly limbs and 
its hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and 
among the smiling only the dead about in the forest 
and this oak refused to to the of spring or 
notice either the spring or the   love happiness 
this oak seemed to say  you not weary of 
that stupid meaningless constantly repeated always the same and always 
a there is no spring no sun no happiness look 
at those dead ever the same and at me too 
sticking out my broken and fingers just where they have 
grown whether from my back or my sides as they 
have grown so i stand and i do not believe 
in your and your lies  as he passed through 
the forest prince andrew turned several times to look at 
that oak as if expecting something from it under the 
oak too were flowers and grass but it stood among 
them scowling and as ever   the oak is 
right a thousand times right thought prince andrew  others 
young to that but we know life our life is 
finished  a whole of new thoughts hopeless but pleasant 
rose in his soul in connection with that tree during 
this he as it were considered his life and arrived 
at his old in its that it was not for 
him to begin anything that he must live out his 
life to do no and not disturbing himself or anything 
     chapter ii   prince 
andrew had to see the of the for the in 
connection with the affairs of the of which he was 
this was count ilya rostov and in the middle of 
may prince andrew went to visit him  it was 
now hot spring weather the whole forest was already in 
green it was and so hot that on passing near 
water one to  prince andrew depressed and with the 
business about which he had to speak to the was 
up the in the of the rostovs house at he 
heard merry girlish behind some on the right and saw 
a group of girls running to cross the path of 
his of the rest and nearer to him ran a 
dark remarkably pretty girl in a dress with a white 
handkerchief on her head from under which locks of hair 
the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was 
a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him  
suddenly he did not know why he felt a the 
day was so beautiful the sun so bright everything around 
so gay but that pretty girl did not know or 
wish to know of his and was and cheerful in 
her own separate foolish bright and happy life  is 
she so glad about what is she thinking of not 
of the military or of the of the serfs of 
what is she thinking why is she so happy prince 
andrew asked himself with curiosity  in  count ilya 
rostov was living at just as he had done in 
former years that is almost the whole with theatricals and 
music he was glad to see prince andrew as he 
was to see any new visitor and on his staying 
the night  during the dull day in the course 
of which he was by his elderly and by the 
more important of the visitors  old count house was 
crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew 
glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members 
of the company and asked himself each time  is 
she thinking about why is she so glad  that 
night alone in new he was long unable to sleep 
he read and then put out his but it it 
was hot in the room the inside of which were 
closed he was cross with the stupid old man  
he called rostov who had made him stay by him 
that some necessary had not yet arrived from town and 
he was vexed with himself for having stayed  he 
got up and went to the window to open it 
as soon as he opened the the as if it 
had long been watching for this burst into the room 
he opened the the night was fresh bright and very 
still just before the window was a row of looking 
black on one side and with a light on the 
other beneath the grew some kind of with silver leaves 
and here and there farther back the dark a with 
to the right was a tree with white and branches 
and above it shone the moon nearly at its full 
in a pale almost spring sky prince andrew leaned his 
elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on 
that sky  his room was on the first floor 
those in the rooms above were also he heard female 
voices   once more said a girlish voice above 
him which prince andrew recognized at once   when 
are you coming to bed replied another voice   
won i can sleep what the use come now for 
the last time   two girlish voices sang a 
musical passage end of some song   how lovely 
now go to sleep and there an end of it 
  go to sleep but i can said the 
first voice coming nearer to the window she was evidently 
right out for the rustle of her dress and even 
her breathing could be heard everything was stone like the 
moon and its light and the prince andrew too dared 
not stir for fear of betraying his presence   
sonya he again heard the first speaker  how can 
you sleep only look how it is ah how do 
up sonya she said almost with tears in her voice 
 never never was such a lovely night before  
sonya made some reply   just come and see 
what a moon oh how lovely come here darling come 
here there you see i feel like sitting down on 
my heels putting my arms round my knees like this 
as as possible and flying away like this   
care you fall out  he heard the sound of 
a and sonya voice  past one o   
you only spoil things for me all right go go 
 again all was silent but prince andrew knew she 
was still sitting there from time to time he heard 
a soft rustle and at times a sigh   
god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed 
 bed then if it must be and she the 
  her i might as well not exist thought 
prince andrew while he listened to her voice for some 
reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about 
him  she is again as if it were on 
purpose thought he  in his soul there suddenly such 
an of youthful thoughts and contrary to the whole of 
his life that unable to explain his condition to himself 
he lay down and fell at once    
  chapter iii   next morning having taken 
leave of no one but the count and not waiting 
for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for 
home  it was already the beginning of when on 
his return he drove into the forest where the old 
oak had made so strange and an on him in 
the forest the sounded yet more than they had done 
six before for now all was thick and and the 
young about in the forest did not on the general 
beauty but themselves to the mood around were green with 
young  the whole day had been hot somewhere a 
was gathering but only a small cloud had some lightly 
the road and the leaves the left side of the 
forest was dark in the the right side in the 
and and scarcely swayed by the everything was in the 
and their voices now near now far away   
here in this forest was that oak with which i 
agreed thought prince andrew  where is it he again 
wondered gazing at the left side of the road and 
without it he looked with at the very oak he 
the old oak quite spreading out a of dark stood 
and slightly in the of the evening sun neither fingers 
nor old nor old and were any of them in 
now through the hard century even where there were no 
leaves had such as one could hardly believe the old 
could have produced   it is the same oak 
thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized 
by an feeling of joy and all the best moments 
of his life suddenly rose to his memory with the 
lofty his wife dead face pierre at the that girl 
by the beauty of the night and that night itself 
and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his 
mind   life is not over at thirty prince 
andrew suddenly decided finally and  is not enough for 
me to know what i have in me must know 
it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly 
away into the sky everyone must know me so that 
my life may not be lived for myself alone while 
others live so apart from it but so that it 
may be reflected in them all and they and i 
may live in   on reaching home prince andrew 
decided to go to petersburg that and found all sorts 
of reasons for this decision a whole of sensible and 
showing it to be essential for him to go to 
petersburg and even to the service kept up in his 
mind he could not now understand how he could ever 
even have the necessity of taking an active in life 
just as a month before he had not understood how 
the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter 
his head it now seemed clear to him that all 
his experience of life must be wasted unless he it 
to some kind of work and again played an active 
part in life he did not even remember how on 
the strength of wretched it had seemed obvious that he 
would be himself if he now after the lessons he 
had had in life allowed himself to believe in the 
of being and in the of happiness or love now 
reason suggested quite the opposite after that to he found 
the country dull his former no longer interested him and 
often when sitting alone in his study he got up 
went to the mirror and gazed a long time at 
his own face then he would turn away to the 
portrait of his dead lise who with hair a la 
looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the frame 
she did not now say those former terrible words to 
him but looked simply merrily and at him and prince 
andrew crossing his arms behind him long the room now 
frowning now smiling as he reflected on those thoughts secret 
as a which altered his whole life and were connected 
with pierre with with the girl at the window the 
oak and woman beauty and love and if anyone came 
into his room at such moments he was particularly cold 
stern and above all   dear princess mary entering 
at such a moment would say  nicholas can go 
out today it very cold   it were hot 
prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to 
his sister  could go out in his but as 
it is cold he must wear warm clothes which were 
for that purpose that is what follows from the fact 
that it is cold and not that a child who 
fresh air should remain at home he would add with 
extreme as if someone for those secret that within him 
 at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual 
work men up      chapter iv 
  prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august  
it was the time when the youthful was at the 
of his and his were being pushed forward with the 
greatest energy that same august the emperor was thrown from 
his his and remained three at receiving every day and 
no one else at that time the two famous were 
being prepared that so agitated society court ranks and to 
for the of and state not merely these but a 
whole state intended to change the order of government in 
russia and from the of state down to the now 
those with which the emperor alexander had ascended the throne 
and which he had tried to put into effect with 
the of his novosiltsev and he himself in had called 
his de public taking shape and being realized  now 
all these men were replaced by on the civil side 
and on the military soon after his arrival prince andrew 
as a of the himself at court and at a 
the emperor though he met him twice did not favor 
him with a single word it had always seemed to 
prince andrew before that he was to the emperor and 
that the latter his face and generally and in the 
cold glance the emperor gave him he now found further 
of this the explained the emperor of him by his 
majesty at bolkonski not having served since    
know myself that one cannot help one and thought prince 
andrew  it will not do to present my for 
the reform of the army to the emperor personally but 
the will speak for itself  he mentioned what he 
had written to an old field a friend of his 
father the field made an appointment to see him received 
him graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few 
days later prince andrew received notice that he was to 
go to see the of war count   on 
the appointed day prince andrew entered count waiting room at 
nine in the morning  he did not know personally 
had never seen him and all he had heard of 
him inspired him with but little respect for the man 
  is of war a man by the emperor 
and i need not myself about his qualities he has 
been to consider my so he alone can get it 
adopted thought prince andrew as he waited among a number 
of important and people in count waiting room  during 
his service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen 
the of many important men and the different of such 
rooms were well known to him count anteroom had quite 
a special character the faces of the people awaiting their 
turn for an audience showed embarrassment and the faces of 
those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness 
covered by a of unconcern and of themselves their situation 
and the person for whom they were waiting some walked 
up and down others whispered and laughed prince andrew heard 
the nickname  and the words  will give it 
to us hot in reference to count one general  
important evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long 
sat crossing and his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself 
 but the moment the door opened one feeling alone 
appeared on all faces of fear prince andrew for the 
second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in 
his name but received an ironical look and was told 
that his turn would come in course after some others 
had been shown in and out of the room by 
the adjutant on duty an officer who struck prince andrew 
by his and frightened air was at that terrible door 
this officer audience a long time then suddenly the sound 
of a voice was heard from the other side of 
the door and the officer pale face and lips out 
and passed through the waiting room his head  after 
this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the 
officer on duty said in a whisper  the right 
at the window  prince andrew entered a plain room 
and saw at the table a man of forty with 
a long a long head deep wrinkles scowling brows above 
dull eyes and an red nose turned his head toward 
him without looking at him   is your asked 
  am not your excellency returned prince andrew quietly 
 eyes turned toward him   down said he 
 bolkonski   am not about anything his majesty 
the emperor has deigned to send your excellency a by 
me   see my dear sir i have read 
your interrupted uttering only the first words amiably and then 
without looking at prince andrew gradually into a tone of 
 are new military there are many but no one 
to carry out the old ones everybody it is than 
doing   came at his majesty the emperor wish 
to learn from your excellency how you to deal with 
the i have said prince andrew politely   have 
a resolution on your and sent it to the i 
do not of it said rising and taking a paper 
from his table  and he it to prince andrew 
 across the paper was in without capital and without 
 because an of the french military and from the 
of war   what has the been inquired prince 
andrew   the on army and i have recommended 
that your honor should be appointed a member but without 
a  prince andrew smiled   don want one 
  member without repeated  have the honor eh 
call the next one who else is there he shouted 
to prince andrew      chapter v 
  while waiting for the of his appointment to 
the prince andrew looked up his former particularly those he 
knew to be in power and whose he might need 
in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had 
had on the of a battle when by anxious curiosity 
and to the where the future on which the fate 
of millions was being from the irritation of the older 
men the curiosity of the the reserve of the the 
and of everyone and the and of whose he learned 
every day he felt that now in  here in 
petersburg a civil was in the commander in chief of 
which was a person he did not know but who 
was to be a man of and this movement of 
of which prince andrew had a idea and its chief 
began to interest him so that the question of the 
army quickly to a place in his consciousness  prince 
andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in 
the highest and most petersburg of the day the party 
and him in the first place because he was to 
be clever and very well read and because by his 
serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a the 
party of the old and dissatisfied who the turned to 
him expecting his sympathy in their of the simply because 
he was the son of his father the feminine society 
world him because he was rich distinguished a good match 
and almost a with a of on account of his 
death and the of his wife besides this the general 
opinion of all who had known him was that he 
had greatly during these last five years having and grown 
more lost his former affectation pride and irony and the 
that comes with years people talked about him were interested 
in him and wanted to meet him  the day 
after his interview with count prince andrew spent the evening 
at count he told the count of his interview with 
 spoke of by that nickname with the same irony 
prince andrew had noticed in the of war anteroom  
 cher even in this case you can do without 
michael he everything i speak to him he has promised 
to come this evening   has to do with 
the army asked prince andrew  shook his head smilingly 
as if surprised at bolkonski   were talking to 
him about you a few days ago continued  about 
your   is it you prince who have your 
serfs said an old man of catherine day turning contemptuously 
toward bolkonski   was a small that brought in 
no replied prince andrew trying to his so as not 
to the old man   of being late said 
the old man looking at   one thing i 
don understand he continued  will the land if they 
are set free it is easy to write but difficult 
to rule just the same as now ask you count 
will be heads of the when everybody has to pass 
  who pass the i suppose replied crossing his 
legs and glancing round   i have serving under 
me a splendid man a priceless man but he is 
he to go up for   that a difficulty 
as education is not at all general but  count 
did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the 
arm and went to meet a tall bald fair man 
of about forty with a large open forehead and a 
long face of and peculiar who was just entering the 
wore a blue swallow coat with a cross from his 
neck and a star on his left breast it was 
prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a within 
him as happens at moments of life whether it was 
from respect or he did not know whole figure was 
of a peculiar type that made him easily in the 
society in which prince andrew lived he had never seen 
anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such 
and self he had never seen so resolute yet gentle 
an expression as that in those half rather eyes or 
so firm a smile that expressed nothing nor had he 
heard such a refined soft voice above all he had 
never seen such delicate of face or hands which were 
broad but very plump soft and white such and softness 
prince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers 
who had been long in hospital this was secretary of 
state to the emperor and his companion at where he 
had more than once met and talked with napoleon  
did not his eyes from one face to another as 
people do on entering a large company and was in 
no to speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he 
would be listened to and he looked only at the 
person with whom he was conversing  prince andrew followed 
every word and movement with particular attention as happens to 
some people especially to men who judge those near to 
them severely he always on meeting anyone new anyone whom 
like he knew by reputation to in him the perfection 
of human qualities  told he was sorry he had 
been unable to come sooner as he had been detained 
at the he did not say that the emperor had 
kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of when 
introduced prince andrew slowly turned his eyes to bolkonski with 
his smile and looked at him in silence   
am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard 
of you as everyone has he said after a pause 
 said a few words about the reception had given 
bolkonski smiled more   of the on army is 
my good friend monsieur he said fully every word and 
syllable  if you like i can put you in 
touch with him he paused at the full stop  
hope you will find him and ready to in all 
that is  a circle soon formed round and the 
old man who had talked about his addressed a question 
to him  prince andrew without joining in the conversation 
watched every movement of this man not long since an 
insignificant student who now bolkonski thought held in his hands 
plump white hands fate of russia prince andrew was struck 
by the with which answered the old man he appeared 
to condescending words to him from an height when the 
old man began to speak too loud smiled and said 
he could not judge of the or of what pleased 
the sovereign  having talked for a little while in 
the general circle rose and coming up to prince andrew 
took him along to the other end of the room 
it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest 
himself in bolkonski   had no to talk with 
you prince during the animated conversation in which that me 
he said with a smile as if by that smile 
that he and prince andrew understood the of the people 
with whom he had just been talking this flattered prince 
andrew  have known of you for a long time 
first from your with regard to your serfs a first 
example of which it is very that there should be 
more and because you are one of those gentlemen of 
the who have not considered themselves offended by the new 
the ranks to which is causing so much gossip and 
  said prince andrew  father did not wish 
me to take of the privilege i began the service 
from the lower   father a man of the 
last century evidently above our who so this measure which 
merely natural   think however that these have some 
ground returned prince andrew trying to influence of which he 
began to be conscious he did not like to agree 
with him in everything and felt a wish to though 
he usually spoke easily and well he felt a difficulty 
in expressing himself now while talking with he was too 
much in the famous man   of maybe put 
in quietly   of state interest to some said 
prince andrew   do you mean asked quietly lowering 
his eyes   am an of replied prince andrew 
 his idea that le des est l me de 
la me des de       
    of is honor seems to me 
     certain rights and for the 
     aristocracy appear to me a 
means of that        
the smile vanished from white face which was much by 
the change probably prince andrew thought interested him   
vous la question point de  he began pronouncing french 
with evident difficulty and speaking even than in russian but 
quite         you 
regard the question from that point of   went 
on to say that honor l cannot be by to 
the service that honor l is either a of not 
doing what is or it is a of in of 
commendation and which recognize it his were simple and clear 
  honor the of is one to the d 
of the great emperor napoleon not but to the success 
of the service but not a class or court privilege 
  do not that but it cannot be that 
court have the same end returned prince andrew  considers 
himself to maintain his position   you do not 
care to yourself of the privilege prince said indicating by 
a smile that he wished to finish amiably an which 
was for his companion  you will do me the 
honor of calling on me on wednesday he added  
will after talking with let you know what may interest 
you and shall also have the pleasure of a more 
with you  his eyes he bowed a la without 
taking leave and trying to attract as little attention as 
possible he left the room      
chapter vi   during the first of his stay 
in petersburg prince andrew felt the whole of thought he 
had formed during his life of quite by the cares 
that him in that city  on returning home in 
the evening he would down in his four or five 
necessary calls or for certain hours the of life the 
of the day so as to be in time everywhere 
the greater part of his energy he did nothing did 
not even think or find time to think but only 
talked and talked of what he had thought while in 
the country  he sometimes noticed with that he repeated 
the same remark on the same day in different but 
he was so busy for whole days together that he 
had no time to notice that he was thinking of 
nothing  as he had done on their first meeting 
at produced a strong on prince andrew on the wednesday 
when he received him tete at his own house and 
talked to him long and  to bolkonski so many 
people appeared and insignificant and he so to find in 
someone the living of that perfection toward which he that 
he believed that in he had found this of a 
perfectly and virtuous man had sprung from the same class 
as himself and possessed the same and bolkonski would soon 
have discovered his weak human sides but as it was 
strange and turn of mind inspired him with respect all 
the more because he did not quite understand him moreover 
either because he appreciated the other capacity or because he 
considered it necessary to him to his side showed off 
his calm before prince andrew and flattered him with that 
subtle which goes hand in hand with self and in 
a that one companion is the only man besides capable 
of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and 
the and of one own ideas  during their long 
conversation on wednesday evening more than once remarked  regard 
everything that is above the common of custom or with 
a smile  we want the to be and the 
to be safe or  cannot understand this and all 
in a way that seemed to say  you and 
i understand what they are and who we are  
this first long conversation with only in prince andrew the 
feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting 
he saw in him a clear man of who by 
his energy and had power which he was using solely 
for the welfare of russia in prince andrew eyes was 
the man he would himself have wished to be who 
explained all the of life considered important only what was 
and was capable of applying the of reason to everything 
everything seemed so simple and clear in that prince andrew 
agreed with him about everything if he replied and it 
was only because he wished to maintain his and not 
to opinions entirely everything was right and everything was as 
it should be only one thing disconcerted prince andrew this 
was cold look which did not allow one to to 
his soul and his delicate white hands which prince andrew 
watched as one does watch the hands of those who 
power this and those delicate hands prince andrew he knew 
not why he was struck too by the for others 
that he observed in and by the of lines of 
he used to support his opinions he made use of 
every kind of mental except and passed too boldly it 
seemed to prince andrew from one to another now he 
would take up the position of a practical man and 
now that of a and laugh ironically at his now 
grow severely or suddenly rise to the of  last 
was one he very frequently employed he would a question 
to pass on to of space time and thought and 
having the he would again to the of the  
in general the of which struck prince andrew most was 
his absolute and in the power and of reason it 
was evident that the thought could never occur to him 
which to prince andrew seemed so natural that it is 
after all impossible to express all one thinks and that 
he had never felt the doubt  not all i 
think and believe nonsense and it was just this peculiarity 
of mind that particularly prince andrew  during the first 
period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt a passionate for him 
to that which he had once felt for bonaparte the 
fact that was the son of a village and that 
stupid people might him on account of his  in 
fact many did prince andrew to his for him the 
more and to it  on that first evening bolkonski 
spent with him having mentioned the for the of the 
of told him that the had for a hundred and 
fifty years had cost millions and had done nothing except 
that had stuck on the of the different   
that is all the state has for the millions it 
has spent said he  want to give the new 
but we have no that is why it is a 
sin for men like you prince not to serve in 
these times  prince andrew said that for that work 
an education in was which he did not   
it so what would you have it is a circle 
from which we must break a way out  a 
week later prince andrew was a member of the on 
army and he had not at all expected of a 
section of the for the of the at request he 
took the first part of the civil that was being 
drawn up and with the of the napoleon and the 
of he worked at the section on rights   
   chapter vii   nearly two years 
before this in  pierre on returning to petersburg after 
visiting his estates had found himself in a leading position 
among the petersburg he arranged dining and new members and 
himself and he gave money for the of and as 
far as he could the collection of in regard to 
which the of members were stingy and he almost a 
the order had in petersburg  his life meanwhile continued 
as before with the same and he liked to dine 
and drink well and though he considered it and humiliating 
could not the of the bachelor in which he moved 
 amid the of his and however pierre at the 
end of a year began to feel that the more 
firmly he tried to rest upon it the more ground 
on which he stood gave way under him at the 
same time he felt that the deeper the ground under 
him the closer he became to the order when he 
had joined the he had experienced the feeling of one 
who steps onto the surface of a when he put 
his foot down it in to make quite sure of 
the of the ground he put his other foot down 
and deeper still became stuck in it and knee in 
the  was not in petersburg had of late stood 
aside from the affairs of the petersburg and lived almost 
entirely in moscow all the members of the were men 
pierre knew in ordinary life and it was difficult for 
him to regard them merely as in and not as 
prince or vasilevich d whom he knew in society as 
weak and insignificant men under the and he saw the 
and at which they in ordinary life often after collecting 
and up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most 
part in promises from a members of whom half were 
as well able to pay as himself pierre remembered the 
in which each brother promised to all his to his 
and on which he tried not to in his soul 
 he divided the he knew into four in the 
first he put those who did not take an active 
part in the affairs of the or in human affairs 
but were occupied with the science of the order with 
questions of the of god the three elements and the 
meaning of the square and all the of the of 
pierre respected this class of to which the elder ones 
chiefly belonged including pierre thought himself but he did not 
their interests his heart was not in the of  
in the second pierre himself and others like him and 
who had not yet found in a straight and path 
but to do so  in the third he those 
 who saw nothing in but the and and the 
of these without about their or such were and even 
the grand of the  finally to the fourth also 
a great many belonged particularly those who had lately joined 
these to pierre were men who had no in anything 
nor desire for anything but joined the merely to with 
the wealthy young who were influential through their connections or 
rank and of whom there were very many in the 
 pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was 
doing at any rate as he saw it here sometimes 
seemed to him merely on he did not think of 
itself but suspected that russian had taken a wrong path 
and from its and so toward the end of the 
year he went abroad to be into the higher secrets 
of the order  in the summer of  pierre 
returned to petersburg our knew from with those abroad that 
bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons 
had been into many had been raised to a higher 
and was bringing back with him much that might to 
the of the cause in russia the petersburg all came 
to see him tried to themselves with him and it 
seemed to them all that he was preparing something for 
them and concealing it  a solemn meeting of the 
of the second degree was at which pierre promised to 
to the petersburg what he had to to them from 
the highest of their order the meeting was a full 
one after the usual pierre rose and began his  
 he began blushing and with a written speech in 
his hand  is not sufficient to observe our in 
the of our must act we are but we must 
act pierre raised his and began to read   
the of truth and to secure the of he read 
 must men from in with the spirit of the 
times the education of the young ourselves in with the 
men boldly yet and folly and form of those devoted 
to us a body together by of purpose and possessed 
of and power   this end we must secure 
a of over and must to secure that the man 
may even in this world receive a reward for his 
but in these great endeavors we are gravely by the 
political of today what is to be done in these 
circumstances to favor everything force by force no we are 
very far from that every reform censure for it quite 
to while men remain what they are and also because 
no violence   whole plan of our order should 
be on the idea of preparing men of and together 
by of conviction at the of and folly and patronizing 
talent and raising worthy men from the dust and them 
to our only then will our order have the power 
to the hands of the of and to control them 
without their being aware of it in a word we 
must found a form of government holding which should be 
over the whole world without the of citizenship and beside 
which all other can continue in their course and do 
everything except what the great aim of our order which 
is to obtain for the over this aim was that 
of itself it taught men to be and good and 
for their own to follow the example and of the 
best and men   that time when everything was 
in alone was of course sufficient the of truth her 
with special strength but now we need much more powerful 
it is now necessary that man by his should find 
in a to those it is impossible to the but 
we must to direct them to a noble aim and 
it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to 
his within the of our order should provide means to 
that end   soon as we have a certain 
number of worthy men in every state each of them 
again two others and all being everything will be possible 
for our order which has already in secret accomplished much 
for the welfare of mankind  this speech not only 
made a strong but excitement in the the of the 
seeing in it dangerous of  met it with a 
that surprised pierre the grand began answering him and pierre 
began his views with more and more it was long 
since there had been so a meeting parties were formed 
some pierre of others him at that meeting he was 
struck for the first time by the of men minds 
which a truth from ever presenting itself to two persons 
even those members who seemed to be on his side 
understood him in their own way with and he could 
not agree to as what he always wanted most was 
to his thought to others just as he himself understood 
it         the 
to for        at 
the end of the meeting the grand with irony and 
ill bezukhov for his and said it was not love 
of alone but also a love of that had moved 
him in the pierre did not answer him and asked 
whether his would be he was told that it would 
not and without waiting for the usual he left the 
and went home      chapter viii 
  again pierre was by the he so for 
three days after the of his speech at the he 
lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and 
going nowhere  it was just then that he received 
a letter from his wife who him to see her 
telling him how she was about him and how she 
wished to her whole life to him  at the 
end of the letter she him that in a few 
days she would return to petersburg from abroad  following 
this letter one of the whom pierre respected less than 
the others forced his way in to see him and 
turning the conversation upon pierre affairs by way of advice 
expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was 
wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first 
of by not the  at the same time his 
mother prince vasili wife sent to him him to come 
if only for a few minutes to discuss a most 
important matter pierre saw that there was a against him 
and that they wanted to him with his wife and 
in the mood he then was this was not even 
unpleasant to him nothing to him nothing in life seemed 
to him of much importance and under the influence of 
the that possessed him he neither his liberty nor his 
resolution to his wife   one is right and 
no one is to so she too is not to 
he thought  if he did not at once give 
his consent to a with his wife it was only 
because in his state of he did not feel able 
to take any step had his wife come to him 
he would not have turned her away to what him 
was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived 
with his wife or not  without either to his 
wife or his mother pierre late one night prepared for 
a and started for moscow to see this is what 
he noted in his   moscow   i 
have just returned from my benefactor and to write down 
what i have experienced is living and has for three 
years been suffering from a painful of the no one 
has ever heard him utter a or a word of 
from morning till late at night except when he eats 
his very plain food he is at science he received 
me graciously and made me sit down on the bed 
on which he lay i made the sign of the 
of the east and of and he in the same 
manner asking me with a smile what i had learned 
and gained in the prussian and i told him everything 
as best i could and told him what i had 
to our petersburg of the bad reception i had and 
of my with the having remained silent and thoughtful for 
a good while told me his of the matter which 
at once lit up for me my whole past and 
the future path i should follow he surprised me by 
asking whether i remembered the aim of the order  
the and study of the  the and of for 
its reception and  the of the human race by 
for such which is the aim of these three certainly 
self and self only to this aim can we always 
of circumstances but at the same time just this aim 
the greatest of us and so led by pride losing 
sight of this aim we ourselves either with the which 
in our we are to receive or the of the 
human race while ourselves setting an example of and is 
not a just because it is by social and up 
by pride on this ground my speech and my whole 
and in the of my soul i agreed with him 
talking of my family affairs he said to me  
chief duty of a true as i have told you 
lies in himself we often think that by all the 
difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our 
aim but on the contrary my dear sir it is 
only in the midst of cares that we can our 
three chief  self man can only know himself by 
 self which can only be by and  the 
attainment of the chief of death only the of life 
can show us its vanity and our love of death 
or of to a new life these words are all 
the more because in spite of his great sufferings is 
never weary of life though he death for which spite 
of the and loftiness of his inner man does not 
yet feel himself prepared my benefactor then explained to me 
fully the meaning of the great square of and pointed 
out to me that the three and seven are the 
of everything he me not to avoid intercourse with the 
petersburg but to take up only second in the to 
try while the from pride to turn them toward the 
true path self and self besides this he me for 
myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself 
and to that end he gave me a the one 
i am now in and in which i will in 
future note down all my actions   petersburg  
 i am again living with my wife my mother 
came to me in tears and said that helene was 
here and that she me to hear her that she 
was innocent and unhappy at my and much more i 
knew that if i once let myself see her i 
should not have strength to go on what she wanted 
in my i did not know whose and advice to 
had my benefactor been here he would have told me 
what to do i went to my room and and 
recalled my conversations with him and from it all that 
i ought not to refuse a and ought to reach 
a helping hand to everyone to one so to me 
that i must bear my cross but if i forgive 
her for the sake of doing right then let with 
her have only a aim that is what i decided 
and what i wrote to i told my wife that 
i begged her to forget the past to forgive me 
wrong i may have done her and that i had 
nothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her 
this she need not know how hard it was for 
me to see her again i have settled on the 
upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a 
happy feeling of      chapter ix 
  at that time as always happens the highest 
society that met at court and at the grand balls 
was divided into several each with its own particular tone 
the of these was the french circle of the alliance 
the circle of count rumyantsev and in this group helene 
as soon as she had settled in petersburg with her 
husband took a very prominent place she was by the 
members of the french and by many belonging to that 
circle and noted for their and polished manners  helene 
had been at during the famous meeting of the and 
had brought from there these connections with the at her 
success had been brilliant napoleon himself had noticed her in 
the and said of her  un animal  her 
success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise 
pierre for she had become even handsomer than before what 
did surprise him was that during these last two years 
his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation  une 
femme  the distinguished prince de wrote her eight up 
his to produce them in countess presence to be received 
in the countess was regarded as a of young men 
read before helene to have something to say in her 
and of the and even ambassadors secrets to her so 
that in a way helene was a power pierre who 
knew she was very stupid sometimes attended with a strange 
feeling of and fear her and dinner parties where politics 
and were discussed at these parties his were like those 
of a who always expects his trick to be found 
out at any moment but whether because was just what 
was to run such a or because those who were 
found pleasure in the at any rate it remained and 
helene reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so 
firmly that she could say the and things and everybody 
would go into over every word of hers and look 
for a profound meaning in it of which she herself 
had no         
 a animal        
  a charming woman as witty as she is 
lovely   pierre was just the husband for a 
brilliant society woman he was that absent a grand husband 
who was in no one way and far from spoiling 
the high tone and general of the drawing room he 
served by the contrast he to her as an advantageous 
to his elegant and wife pierre during the last two 
years as a result of his continual in abstract interests 
and his sincere for all else had in his wife 
circle which did not interest him that air of unconcern 
indifference and toward all which cannot be and therefore involuntary 
respect he entered his wife drawing room as one a 
was acquainted with everybody pleased to see everyone and indifferent 
to them all sometimes he joined in a conversation which 
interested him and of whether any  of the were 
present or not expressed his views which were sometimes not 
at all in accord with the tone of the moment 
but the general opinion the queer husband of  most 
distinguished woman in petersburg was so well that no one 
took his seriously  among the many young men who 
her house every day boris who had already great success 
in the service was the most intimate friend of the 
bezukhov household since helene return from helene spoke of him 
as  page and treated him like a child her 
smile for him was the same as for everybody but 
sometimes that smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him boris behaved 
with a particularly dignified and sad this of also disturbed 
pierre he had so three years before from the to 
which his wife had him that he now himself from 
the danger of its first by not being a husband 
to his wife and by not allowing himself to suspect 
  now that she has become a she has 
finally her former he told himself  has never been 
an of a being carried away by affairs of the 
heart statement which though gathered from an he believed yet 
strange to say boris presence in his wife drawing room 
 he was almost always there had a effect upon 
pierre it his limbs and destroyed the and freedom of 
his movements   a strange thought pierre  i 
used to like him very much  in the eyes 
of the world pierre was a great the rather and 
absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever who did 
nothing but and was a first good fellow but a 
and difficult process of was taking place all this time 
in pierre soul much to him and causing him many 
and joys      chapter x  
 pierre went on with his and this is what 
he wrote in it during that time    
 got up at eight read the then went to 
my duties  advice pierre had entered the service of 
the state and served on one of the returned home 
for dinner and alone countess had many visitors i do 
not like i ate and drank and after dinner copied 
out some for the in the evening i went down 
to the countess and told a funny story about and 
only remembered that i ought not to have done so 
when everybody laughed loudly at it  i am going 
to bed with a happy and mind great god help 
me to walk in  to conquer anger by and 
 to by self and  to from but not 
avoid  the service of the state  family duties 
 relations with my friends and the of my affairs 
    i got up late on waking 
i lay long in bed to o god help and 
me that i may walk in read the but without 
proper feeling brother came and we talked about he told 
me of the emperor new i began to criticize them 
but remembered my and my benefactor words a true freemason 
should be a for the state when his is and 
a quiet when not called on to assist my tongue 
is my v and o me and we had a 
talk about the reception of a new brother they laid 
on me the duty of i feel myself weak and 
then our talk turned to the of the seven and 
steps of the the seven the seven the seven and 
the seven of the spirit brother o was very eloquent 
in the evening the took place the new of the 
much to the of the it was boris who was 
i him and was the a strange feeling agitated me 
all the time i was alone with him in the 
dark i caught myself a feeling of hatred toward him 
which i tried to that is why i should really 
like to save him from and lead him into the 
path of truth but thoughts of him did not leave 
me it seemed to me that his object in entering 
the was merely to be intimate and in favor with 
members of our apart from the fact that he had 
asked me several times whether and were members of our 
 question to which i could not reply and that 
to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for 
our order and is too and satisfied with the outer 
man to desire i had no cause to doubt him 
but he seemed to me and all the time i 
stood alone with him in the dark it seemed to 
me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words and 
i wished really to his bare breast with the sword 
i held to it i could not be eloquent nor 
could i mention my to the and to the grand 
great of nature help me to find the true path 
out of the of lies    after this 
three were left in the and then the following was 
written   i have had a long and talk 
alone with brother v who me to hold fast by 
brother a though i am much was revealed to me 
is the name of the of the world is the 
name of the of all the third name is the 
name which means the all with brother v and support 
me in the path of in his presence doubt has 
no place the between the poor of science and our 
all is clear to me human everything to it and 
kill everything to it in the science of our order 
all is one all is known in its and life 
the three elements of matter and is of an and 
nature in with by its nature it a desire in 
the latter by means of which it it it and 
in other is a the spirit him    
 late read the but was afterwards went and up 
and down the large hall i wished to but instead 
my an of four years ago when dolokhov meeting me 
in moscow after our said he i was peace of 
mind in spite of my wife at the time i 
gave him no answer now i recalled every of that 
meeting and in my mind gave him the most and 
i myself and drove away that thought only when i 
found myself with anger but i did not afterwards boris 
came and began his coming vexed me from the first 
and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i 
up and said much that was unpleasant and even to 
him he became silent and i myself only when it 
was too late my god i cannot get on with 
him at all the cause of this is my egotism 
i set myself above him and so become much worse 
than he for he is to my while i on 
the contrary for him o god grant that in his 
presence i may rather see my own and behave so 
that he too may after dinner i fell and as 
i was off i clearly heard a voice saying in 
my left  day  i that i was in 
the dark and was suddenly by dogs but i went 
on suddenly a dog seized my left with its teeth 
and would not let go i began to it with 
my hands scarcely had i it off before another a 
bigger one began me i lifted it up but the 
higher i lifted it the bigger and it grew and 
suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led me 
to a building to enter which we had to pass 
along a i stepped on it but it bent and 
gave way and i began to up a which i 
could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i 
myself up so that my down on one side and 
my body on the other i looked round and saw 
brother a standing on the and pointing me to a 
broad and garden and in the garden was a large 
and beautiful building i up o great of nature help 
me to tear from myself these dogs especially the last 
which in itself the strength of all the former ones 
and me to enter that of to a of which 
i in my     i that was 
sitting in my house and that i was very glad 
and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i 
with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not 
please him and i wished to come close to him 
and embrace him but as soon as i drew near 
i saw that his face had changed and grown young 
and he was quietly telling me something about the of 
our order but so softly that i could not hear 
it then it seemed that we all left the room 
and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on 
the floor he was telling me something and i wished 
to show him my and not listening to what he 
was saying i began to myself the condition of my 
inner man and the grace of god me and tears 
came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed 
this but he looked at me with vexation and jumped 
up breaking off his remarks i felt and asked whether 
what he had been saying did not me but he 
did not reply gave me a kind look and then 
we suddenly found ourselves in my where there is a 
bed he lay down on the edge of it and 
i with to him and lie down too and he 
said  me what is your chief do you know 
it i think you know it already by this question 
i replied that was my chief he shook his head 
and even more i said that though i was living 
with my wife as he i was not living with 
her as her husband to this he replied that one 
should not deprive a wife of one and gave me 
to understand that that was my duty but i replied 
that i should be ashamed to do it and suddenly 
everything vanished and i and found in my mind the 
from the  life was the light of men and 
the light in and the it not face had looked 
young and bright that day i received a letter from 
my benefactor in which he wrote about  duties  
   i had a from which i with 
a heart i saw that i was in moscow in 
my house in the big sitting room and came in 
from the drawing room i seemed to know at once 
that the process of had already taken place in him 
and i rushed to meet him i embraced him and 
kissed his hands and he said  noticed that my 
face is different i looked at him still holding him 
in my arms and saw that his face was young 
but that he had no hair on his head and 
his features were quite changed and i said  should 
have known you had i met you by and i 
thought to myself  i telling the truth and suddenly 
i saw him lying like a dead body then he 
gradually and went with me into my study carrying a 
large book of of drawing paper i said  drew 
that and he answered by his head i opened the 
book and on all the there were excellent and in 
my i knew that these the love of the soul 
with its and on its i saw a beautiful of 
a in and with a body flying up to the 
and i seemed to know that this was nothing else 
than a of the song of and looking at those 
i i felt that i was doing wrong but could 
not tear myself away from them help me my god 
if me is doing will be done but if i 
am myself the cause me what i should do i 
shall of my debauchery if me     
 chapter xi   the rostovs affairs had not 
during the two years they had spent in the country 
 though nicholas rostov had kept firmly to his resolution 
and was still serving modestly in an regiment spending little 
the way of life at of affairs in particular such 
that the every year the only obviously presenting itself to 
the old count was to apply for an official post 
so he had come to petersburg to look for one 
and also as he said to let the enjoy themselves 
for the last time  soon after their arrival in 
petersburg berg to vera and was  though in moscow 
the rostovs belonged to the best society without themselves giving 
it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of was 
a mixed and one in petersburg they were and the 
very people they had in moscow without inquiring to what 
set they belonged here looked down on them  the 
rostovs lived in the same way in petersburg as in 
moscow and the most people met at their country neighbors 
from old and their daughters a maid of honor pierre 
bezukhov and the son of their who had obtained a 
post in petersburg among the men who very soon became 
visitors at the rostovs house in petersburg were boris pierre 
whom the count had met in the street and home 
with him and berg who spent whole days at the 
rostovs and paid the eldest daughter countess vera the attentions 
a young man when he to  not in vain 
had berg shown everybody his right hand at and held 
a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he that so 
and with so important an air that everyone believed in 
the and of his deed and he had obtained two 
for  in the war he also managed to distinguish 
himself he had picked up the of a that had 
killed an aide standing near the commander in chief and 
had taken it to his commander just as he had 
done after he related this at such length and so 
that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do 
this and he received two for the war also in 
 he was a captain in the guards wore and 
held some special in petersburg  though some smiled when 
told of berg it could not be that he was 
a and officer on excellent terms with his and a 
young man with a brilliant career before him and an 
position in society  four years before meeting a german 
in the of a moscow berg had pointed out vera 
rostova to him and had said in german   
and from that moment had made up his mind to 
marry her now in petersburg having considered the rostovs position 
and his own he decided that the time had come 
to         girl 
shall be my wife   berg was at first 
received with a that was not to him at first 
it seemed strange that the son of an should to 
a countess rostova but berg chief was such a naive 
and good egotism that the rostovs came to think it 
would be a good thing since he himself was so 
firmly convinced that it was good indeed excellent moreover the 
rostovs affairs were seriously as the could not but know 
and above all vera was twenty had been taken out 
everywhere and though she was certainly good and sensible no 
one up to now had to her so they gave 
their consent   see said berg to his whom 
he called  only because he knew that everyone has 
friends  see i have considered it all and should 
not marry if i had not thought it all out 
or if it were in any way but on the 
contrary my papa and mamma are now for have arranged 
that for them in the i can live in petersburg 
on my pay and with her fortune and my good 
we can get along i am not marrying for money 
consider that a wife should bring her and a husband 
his i have my position in the service she has 
connections and some means in our times that is worth 
something isn it but above all she is a handsome 
girl and she me  berg blushed and smiled  
 i love her because her character is sensible and 
very good now the other sister though they are the 
same family is quite different unpleasant character and has not 
the same intelligence she is so you know unpleasant but 
my well you will be coming he was going to 
say  dine but changed his mind and said  
take tea with us and quickly up his tongue he 
a small round ring of tobacco smoke perfectly his of 
happiness  after the first feeling of in the parents 
by berg the tone of usual at such times took 
of the family but the was and in the family 
feeling toward this a certain awkwardness and was evident as 
if they were ashamed of not having loved vera and 
of being so ready to get her off their hands 
the old count felt this most he would probably have 
been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment but 
it from the state of his affairs he did not 
know at all how much he had what his to 
or what he could give vera when his daughters were 
born he had assigned to each of them for her 
an with three hundred serfs but one of these estates 
had already been and the other was and the interest 
so much in that it would have to be so 
that it was impossible to give it to vera nor 
had he any money  berg had already been engaged 
a month and only a week remained before the but 
the count had not yet decided in his own mind 
the question of the nor spoken to his wife about 
it at one time the count thought of giving her 
the or of a forest at another time of money 
on a note of hand a few days before the 
berg entered the count study early one morning and with 
a pleasant smile respectfully asked his future father to let 
him know what vera would be the count was so 
disconcerted by this long inquiry that without consideration he gave 
the first reply that came into his head  like 
your being about it i like it you shall be 
satisfied  and patting berg on the shoulder he got 
up wishing to end the conversation but berg smiling explained 
that if he did not know for certain how much 
vera would have and did not receive at least part 
of the in he would have to break matters off 
  consider count i allowed myself to marry now 
without having definite means to maintain my wife i should 
be badly  the conversation ended by the count who 
wished to be and to avoid further saying that he 
would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles 
berg smiled kissed the count on the shoulder and said 
that he was very grateful but that it was impossible 
for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty 
thousand in ready money  at least twenty thousand count 
he added  then a note of hand for only 
thousand   yes all right said the count hurriedly 
 excuse me my dear fellow i give you twenty 
thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as 
well yes yes kiss me      
chapter xii   natasha was sixteen and it was 
the year  the very year to which she had 
counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed 
four years ago since then she had not seen him 
before sonya and her mother if boris happened to be 
mentioned she spoke quite of that as of some childish 
long matter that was not worth but in the secret 
of her soul the question whether her to boris was 
a or an important promise tormented her  since boris 
left moscow in  to join the army he had 
not seen the rostovs he had been in moscow several 
times and had passed near but had never been to 
see them  sometimes it occurred to natasha that he 
did not wish to see her and this was by 
the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him 
  old friends are not remembered the countess would 
say when boris was mentioned  anna mikhaylovna also had 
of late them less frequently seemed to hold herself with 
particular dignity and always spoke and gratefully of the of 
her son and the brilliant career on which he had 
entered when the rostovs came to petersburg boris called on 
them  he drove to their house in some agitation 
the memory of natasha was his most but he went 
with the firm intention of letting her and her parents 
feel that the childish relations between himself and natasha could 
not be either on her or on him he had 
a brilliant position in society to his with countess a 
brilliant position in the service to the of an important 
whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was beginning to 
make for marrying one of the in petersburg which might 
very easily be realized when he entered the rostovs drawing 
room natasha was in her own room when she heard 
of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room 
flushed and beaming with a more than smile  boris 
remembered natasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining 
from under her curls and childish laughter as he had 
known her four years before and so he was taken 
when quite a different natasha entered and his face expressed 
rapturous this expression on his face pleased natasha   
do you recognize your little asked the countess  boris 
kissed natasha hand and said that he was astonished at 
the change in her   handsome you have grown 
  should think so replied natasha laughing eyes  
 is papa older she asked  natasha sat down 
and without joining in boris conversation with the countess silently 
and studied her childhood he felt the weight of that 
resolute and affectionate and glanced at her occasionally  boris 
uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed 
were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion 
this natasha noticed at once he sat rather sideways in 
the armchair next to the countess arranging with his right 
hand the of gloves that his left hand like a 
skin and he spoke with a particularly refined of his 
lips about the of the highest petersburg society with irony 
old times in moscow and moscow it was not natasha 
felt that he alluded when speaking of the highest aristocracy 
to an ambassador ball he had attended and to invitations 
he had received from and  all this time natasha 
sat silent glancing up at him from under her brows 
this disturbed and confused boris more and more he looked 
round more frequently toward her and broke off in what 
he was saying he did not stay more than ten 
minutes then rose and took his leave the same and 
rather eyes still looked at him after his first visit 
boris said to himself that natasha him just as much 
as ever but that he must not to that feeling 
because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would 
mean to his career while to their former relations without 
intending to marry her would be boris made up his 
mind to avoid meeting natasha but despite that resolution he 
called again a few days later and began calling often 
and spending whole days at the rostovs it seemed to 
him that he ought to have an with natasha and 
tell her that the old times must be forgotten that 
in spite of everything she could not be his wife 
that he had no means and they would never let 
her marry him but he failed to do so and 
felt awkward about entering on such an from day to 
day he became more and more it seemed to her 
mother and sonya that natasha was in love with boris 
as of old she sang him his favorite showed him 
her making him write in it did not allow him 
to to the past letting it be understood how delightful 
was the present and every day he went away in 
a without having said what he meant to and not 
knowing what he was doing or why he came or 
how it would all end he left off visiting helene 
and received notes from her every day and yet he 
continued to spend whole days with the rostovs   
   chapter xiii   one night when 
the old countess in and jacket without her curls and 
with her poor little of hair showing under her white 
cap sighing and on a and to the ground in 
her door and natasha also in a jacket with slippers 
on her bare feet and her hair in ran in 
the countess mood round and frowned she was finishing her 
last  it be that this will be my grave 
natasha flushed and eager seeing her mother in suddenly checked 
her rush half sat down and put out her tongue 
as if herself seeing that her mother was still she 
ran on to the bed and rapidly slipping one little 
foot against the other pushed off her slippers and jumped 
onto the bed the countess had feared might become her 
grave this was high with a feather bed and five 
each than the one below natasha jumped on it into 
the feather bed rolled over to the wall and began 
up the as she settled down raising her knees to 
her out and laughing almost inaudibly now herself up head 
and all and now at her mother the countess finished 
her and came to the bed with a stern face 
but seeing that natasha head was covered she smiled in 
her kind weak way   then now then said 
she   can we have a talk yes said 
natasha  just one on your and another that do 
and her mother round the neck she kissed her on 
the in her behavior to her mother natasha seemed rough 
but she was so and that however she clasped her 
mother she always managed to do it without her or 
making her feel uncomfortable or   what is it 
tonight said the mother having arranged her and waited until 
natasha after turning over a of times had settled down 
beside her under the spread out her arms and assumed 
a serious expression  these visits of natasha at night 
before the count returned from his club were one of 
the greatest of both mother and daughter   is

looked round at her daughter natasha was lying looking steadily 
straight before her at one of the on the corners 
of the so that the countess only saw her daughter 
face in that face struck her by its peculiarly serious 
and concentrated expression  natasha was listening and considering  
 what then said she   have quite turned 
his head and why what do you want of him

natasha without changing her position   he is young

the palm then again turned it over and began kissing 
first one then the space between the then the next

gazing at her daughter and in that seemed to have 
forgotten all she had wished to say   won

smiled and looked at her mother  to marry but

countess and shaking all over she went off into a 
good elderly laugh   laugh stop cried natasha

of the little finger saying  and continued kissing  
august on the other hand  mamma is he very

behind the door  not natasha jumped up up her 
slippers and ran to her own room  it was 
a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking 
that no one could understand all that she understood and 
all there was in her   she thought glancing 
at that little kitten with her enormous of hair  
how could she she virtuous she fell in love with 
nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even 
mamma does not understand it is wonderful how clever i

of herself in the third person and it was some 
very man and best of men was saying it of 
her  is everything everything in her continued this man 
 is intelligent charming and then she is pretty pretty 
and and splendidly and her voice one can really say 
it a wonderful voice  she hummed a from her 
favorite by threw herself on her bed laughed at the 
pleasant thought that she would immediately fall called the maid 
to put out the and before had left the room

everything was as light and beautiful as in and even 
more so because it was different   next day 
the countess called boris aside and had a talk with 
him after which he ceased coming to the rostovs

her father as he opened the door from under the 
which still covered her whole face  sonya the door

of the room smoothing out the folds of the

tongue   what you like exclaimed sonya in a 
voice as she looked at natasha  what you like

at herself in the glass the dress was too long 
  it is not at all too long said 
on her knees after her young lady   if 
it too long we take it up we it up 
in one minute said the resolute taking a needle that 
was stuck on the front of her little shawl and 
still on the floor set to work once more  
at that moment with soft steps the countess came in 
in her cap and velvet gown   my beauty 
exclaimed the count  looks better than any of you 
 he would have embraced her but blushing she stepped 
aside fearing to be   your cap more to 
this side said natasha  arrange it and she rushed 
forward so that the maids who were up her could 
not move fast enough and a piece of was off 
  goodness what has happened really it was not

nurse as she came to the door  sonya they

got into their carriages and started but they had still 
to call at the  was quite ready in spite 
of her age and plainness she had gone through the 
same process as the rostovs but with less to her 
it was a matter of her ugly old body was 
washed and in just the same way she had washed 
behind her ears just as carefully and when she entered 
her drawing room in her dress wearing her badge as 
maid of honor her old lady maid was as full 
of rapturous as the rostovs had been  she the 
rostovs they her taste and and at o of their 
and dresses they settled themselves in their carriages and drove 
off      chapter xv   
natasha had not had a moment free since early morning 
and had not once had time to think of what 
lay before her  in the air and crowded of 
the swaying carriage she for the first time imagined what 
was in store for her there at the ball in 
those lighted rooms music flowers the emperor and all the 
brilliant young people of petersburg the prospect was so splendid 
that she hardly believed it would come true so out 
of keeping was it with the and of the carriage 
she understood all that her only when after over the 
red at the entrance she entered the hall took off 
her cloak and beside sonya and in front of her 
mother the stairs between the flowers only then did she 
remember how she must behave at a ball and tried 
to the air she considered for a girl on such 
an occasion but for her she felt her eyes growing 
she saw nothing clearly her beat a hundred to the 
minute and the blood at her heart she could not 
that which would have made her and she moved on 
almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might 
to it and this was the very attitude that became 
her best before and behind them other visitors were entering 
also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the 
on the landing reflected ladies in white pale and pink 
dresses with diamonds and on their bare and arms  
natasha looked in the and could not distinguish her from 
the others all was into one brilliant on entering the 
ballroom the regular of voices footsteps and greetings natasha and 
the light and her still more the host and hostess 
who had already been standing at the door for half 
an hour repeating the same words to the arrivals  
de vous  greeted the rostovs and in the same 
manner         to 
see you   the two girls in their white 
dresses each with a rose in her black hair both 
in the same way but the hostess eye rested longer 
on the natasha she looked at her and gave her 
alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile 
as hostess looking at her she may have recalled the 
days of her own and her own first ball the 
host also followed natasha with his eyes and asked the 
count which was his daughter   said he kissing 
the tips of his fingers  in the ballroom guests 
stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the emperor the 
countess took up a position in one of the front 
rows of that crowd natasha heard and felt that several 
people were asking about her and looking at her she 
realized that those noticing her liked her and this observation 
helped to calm her   are some like ourselves 
and some worse she thought  was pointing out to 
the countess the most important people at the ball  
 is the ambassador do you see that gray man 
she said indicating an old man with a of silver 
curly hair who was by ladies laughing at something he 
said   here she is the queen of petersburg 
countess said indicating helene who had just entered  lovely 
she is quite equal to marya see how the men 
young and old pay court to her beautiful and clever 
they say prince quite mad about her but see those 
two though not good are even more run after  
she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room 
followed by a very plain daughter   is a 
splendid match a said  look here come her  
 is brother anatole kuragin she said indicating a handsome 
officer of the horse guards who passed by them with 
head erect looking at something over the heads of the 
ladies  handsome isn he i hear they will marry 
him to that rich girl but your cousin is also 
very attentive to her they say she has millions oh 
yes that the french ambassador himself she replied to the 
countess inquiry about  as if he were a king 
all the same the french are charming very charming no 
one more charming in society ah here she is yes 
she is still the most beautiful of them all our 
marya and how simply she is dressed lovely and that 
stout one in spectacles is the freemason she went on 
indicating pierre  him beside his wife and he looks 
a regular  pierre swaying his stout body making way 
through the crowd and nodding to right and left as 
and good as if he were passing through a crowd 
at a fair he pushed through evidently looking for someone 
 natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre 
 as had called him and knew he was looking 
for them and for her in particular he had promised 
to be at the ball and introduce to her  
but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very 
handsome dark man of middle height and in a white 
uniform who stood by a window talking to a tall 
man wearing stars and a ribbon natasha at once recognized 
the and younger man in the white uniform it was 
bolkonski who seemed to her to have grown much younger 
happier and better   someone else we know do 
you see mamma said natasha pointing out prince andrew  
remember he stayed a night with us at   
you know him said  can bear him il a 
present la le beau  he too proud for anything 
takes after his father and he hand in with some 
or other just look how he the ladies there one 
talking to him and he has turned away she said 
pointing at him  give it to him if he 
treated me as he does those ladies    
     is all the just now 
     chapter xvi   suddenly 
everybody began talking and pressed forward and then back and 
between the two rows which the emperor entered to the 
sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him 
walked his host and hostess he walked in rapidly to 
right and left as if anxious to get the first 
moments of the reception over the band played the in 
vogue at that time on account of the words that 
had been set to it beginning  all our hearts 
you quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room 
the crowd made a rush for the doors and several 
persons with faces hurried there and back again then the 
crowd hastily from the drawing door at which the emperor 
talking to the hostess a young man looking down on 
the ladies asking them to move aside some ladies with 
faces betraying complete of all the of decorum pushed forward 
to the of their the men began to choose and 
take their places for the  everyone moved back and 
the emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading 
his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to 
the music the host followed with marya then came ambassadors 
ministers and whom named more than half the ladies already 
had and were taking up or preparing to take up 
their positions for the natasha felt that she would be 
left with her mother and sonya among a of women 
who crowded near the wall not having been to dance 
she stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely 
bosom rising and falling and with and frightened eyes gazed 
straight before her evidently prepared for the height of joy 
or she was not concerned about the emperor or any 
of those great people whom was pointing out had but 
one thought  it possible no one will ask me 
that i shall not be among the first to dance 
is it possible that not one of all these men 
will notice me they do not even seem to see 
me or if they do they look as if they 
were saying  she not the one i after so 
it not worth looking at her no it impossible she 
thought  must know how i long to dance how 
splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy dancing with 
me  the strains of the which had continued for 
a considerable time had to sound like a sad to 
natasha ears she wanted to cry had left them the 
count was at the other end of the room she 
and the countess and sonya were standing by themselves as 
in the of a forest amid that crowd of with 
no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone 
prince andrew with a lady passed by evidently not them 
the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on 
his arm and looked at natasha as one looks at 
a wall boris passed them twice and each time turned 
away berg and his wife who were not dancing came 
up to them  this family gathering seemed humiliating to 
natasha if there were nowhere else for the family to 
talk but here at the ball she did not listen 
to or look at vera who was telling her something 
about her own green dress  at last the emperor 
stopped beside his last partner  had danced with three 
and the music ceased a aide ran up to the 
rostovs them to stand farther back though as it was 
they were already close to the wall and from the 
gallery the distinct strains of a the emperor looked smilingly 
down the room a minute passed but no one had 
yet dancing an aide the of went up to countess 
and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand 
and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him 
the aide an in his art his partner firmly round 
her with confident started smoothly first round the edge of 
the circle then at the corner of the room he 
caught helene left hand and turned her the only sound 
audible apart from the ever music being the of the 
spurs on his feet while at every third beat his 
partner velvet dress spread out and seemed to as she 
round natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry 
because it was not she who was dancing that first 
turn of the  prince andrew in the white uniform 
of a cavalry colonel wearing stockings and dancing shoes stood 
looking animated and bright in the front row of the 
circle not far from the rostovs baron was talking to 
him about the first sitting of the of state to 
be held next day prince andrew as one connected with 
and in the work of the could give information about 
that sitting which were current but not listening to what 
was saying he was gazing now at the sovereign and 
now at the men intending to dance who had not 
yet gathered courage to enter the circle  prince andrew 
was watching these men by the emperor presence and the 
women who were to be asked to dance  pierre 
came up to him and caught him by the arm 
  always dance i have a the young rostova 
here ask her he said   is she asked 
bolkonski  me he added turning to the baron  
will finish this conversation a ball one must dance he 
stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated the expression of 
natasha face caught his eye he recognized her guessed her 
saw that it was her remembered her conversation at the 
window and with an expression of pleasure on his face 
approached countess rostova   me to introduce you to 
my daughter said the countess with color   have 
the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess me 
said prince andrew with a low and bow quite remarks 
about his and approaching natasha he held out his arm 
to her before he had his invitation he asked her 
to that expression on natasha face prepared either for despair 
or suddenly brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile  
 have long been waiting for you that frightened happy 
little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced 
the tears as she raised her hand to prince andrew 
shoulder they were the second to enter the circle prince 
andrew was one of the best of his day and 
natasha danced her little feet in their white dancing shoes 
did their work swiftly lightly and of herself while her 
face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender bare arms and 
neck were not beautiful to helene her shoulders looked thin 
and her bosom but helene seemed as it were by 
a left by the thousands of looks that had scanned 
her person while natasha was like a girl exposed for 
the first time who would have felt very much ashamed 
had she not been that this was absolutely necessary  
prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly 
as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone 
addressed to him wishing also to break up the circle 
of he by the emperor presence he danced and had 
natasha because pierre pointed her out to him and because 
she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye 
but scarcely had he embraced that slender figure and felt 
her stirring so close to him and smiling so near 
him than the wine of her rose to his head 
and he felt himself and when after leaving her he 
stood breathing deeply and watching the other    
  chapter xvii   after prince andrew boris 
came up to ask natasha for a dance and then 
the aide who had opened the ball and several other 
young men so that flushed and happy and passing on 
her to sonya she did not dancing all the evening 
she noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else 
not only did she to notice that the emperor talked 
a long time with the french ambassador and how particularly 
gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince 
so and so did and said this and that and 
that helene had great success and was by the special 
attention of so but she did not even see the 
emperor and only noticed that he had gone because the 
ball became after his for one of the merry before 
supper prince andrew was again her partner he reminded her 
of their first in the and how she had been 
unable to sleep that night and told her how he 
had her natasha blushed at that and tried to excuse 
herself as if there had been something to be ashamed 
of in what prince andrew had  like all men 
who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting 
someone there not of the conventional society and such was 
natasha with her surprise her her and even her in 
speaking french with her he behaved with special care and 
tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and 
most matters he her shy grace in the middle of 
the having one of the natasha still out of was 
returning to her seat when another chose her she was 
tired and and evidently thought of but immediately put her 
hand gaily on the man shoulder smiling at prince andrew 
  be glad to sit beside you and rest 
i tired but you see how they keep asking me 
and i glad of it i happy and i love 
everybody and you and i understand it all and much 
much more was said in her smile when her partner 
left her natasha ran across the room to choose two 
ladies for the figure   she goes to her 
cousin first and then to another lady she will be 
my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his 
own surprise as he watched her she did go first 
to her cousin   sometimes one head thought prince 
andrew  what is certain is that that girl is 
so charming so that she won be dancing here a 
month before she will be married such as she are 
rare here he thought as natasha a rose that was 
slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him  when 
the was over the old count in his blue coat 
came up to the he prince andrew to come and 
see them and asked his daughter whether she was herself 
natasha did not answer at once but only looked up 
with a smile that said  can you ask such 
a question   have never enjoyed myself so much 
before she said and prince andrew noticed how her thin 
arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and 
instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had ever 
been in her life she was at that height of 
when one completely kind and good and does not believe 
in the of or sorrow  at that ball pierre 
for the first time felt by the position his wife 
occupied in court he was gloomy and absent a deep 
ran across his forehead and standing by a window he 
stared over his spectacles seeing no one  on her 
way to supper natasha passed him  pierre gloomy unhappy 
look struck her she stopped in front of him she 
wished to help him to on him the of her 
own happiness   delightful it is count said she 
 it  pierre smiled absent evidently not what she 
said   i am very glad he said  
 can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natasha  
such a capital fellow as bezukhov in natasha eyes all 
the people at the ball alike were good kind and 
splendid people one another none of them capable of another 
so they ought all to be happy    
  chapter xviii   next day prince andrew 
thought of the ball but his mind did not on 
it long  it was a very brilliant ball and 
then  that little rostova is very charming there something 
fresh un about her that distinguishes her that was all 
he thought about yesterday ball and after his morning tea 
he set to work  but either from or want 
of sleep he was ill for work and could get 
nothing done he kept his own work as he often 
did and was glad when he heard someone coming  
the visitor was who served on all the in petersburg 
and a passionate of the new ideas and of and 
a petersburg of those men who choose their opinions like 
their clothes to the fashion but who for that very 
reason appear to be the hardly had he got rid 
of his hat before he ran into prince andrew room 
with a air and at once began talking he had 
just heard of that morning sitting of the of state 
opened by the emperor and he spoke of it enthusiastically 
the emperor speech had been extraordinary it had been a 
speech such as only  sovereign plainly said that the 
and are estates of the he said that the government 
must rest not on but on secure the emperor said 
that the system must be and the accounts certain words 
and opening his eyes significantly   yes today mark 
an the greatest in our history he concluded  prince 
andrew listened to the account of the opening of the 
of state which he had so and to which he 
had attached such importance and was surprised that this now 
that it had taken place did not him and even 
seemed quite insignificant he listened with quiet irony to enthusiastic 
account of it a very simple thought occurred to him 
 does it matter to me or to what the 
emperor was pleased to say at the can all that 
make me any happier or better  and this simple 
suddenly destroyed all the interest prince andrew had felt in 
the he was going to dine that evening at  
only a few friends as the host had said when 
inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate 
home circle of the man he so had greatly interested 
prince andrew especially as he had not yet seen in 
his but now he felt to go to it  
at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house 
in the in the dining room this small house for 
its extreme  that of a prince andrew who was 
rather late found the friendly gathering of intimate already assembled 
at five o there were no ladies present except little 
daughter  like her father and her governess the other 
guests were and while still in the anteroom prince andrew 
heard loud voices and a ringing laugh laugh such as 
one on the someone sounded like distinctly prince andrew had 
never before heard famous laugh and this ringing high laughter 
from a statesman made a strange on him  he 
entered the dining room the whole company were standing between 
two at a small table laid with hors wearing a 
gray swallow coat with a star on the breast and 
evidently still the same waistcoat and high white he had 
worn at the meeting of the of state stood at 
the table with a beaming countenance his guests him addressing 
himself to was an anecdote and was laughing in at 
what was going to say when prince andrew entered the 
room words were again by laughter gave a deep bass 
as he a piece of and laughed softly with a 
and in a high manner  still laughing held out 
his soft white hand to prince andrew   pleased 
to see you prince he said  moment he went 
on turning to and interrupting his story  have agreed 
that this is a dinner for with not a word 
about business and turning again to the narrator he began 
to laugh  prince andrew looked at the laughing with 
regret and it seemed to him that this was not 
but someone else everything that had appeared and fascinating in 
suddenly became plain and  at dinner the conversation did 
not for a moment and seemed to of the of 
a book of funny before had finished his story someone 
else was anxious to something still most of the if 
not to the state service related to people in the 
service it seemed that in this company the of those 
people was so that the only possible attitude toward them 
was one of good related how at the that morning 
a when asked his opinion replied that he thought so 
too gave a long account of an official for the 
of everybody concerned broke into the conversation and began talking 
of the abuses that under the former order of things 
to give a serious turn to the conversation starting about 
his intervened with a joke and the talk to its 
former lively tone  evidently liked to rest after his 
and find in a circle of friends and his guests 
understanding his wish tried to him and themselves but their 
gaiety seemed to prince andrew and tiresome high voice struck 
him and the laughter on him like a note prince 
andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be 
a on the of the company but no one took 
any notice of his being out of with the general 
mood they all seemed very gay  he tried several 
times to join in the conversation but his remarks were 
tossed aside each time like a thrown out of the 
water and he could not with them  there was 
nothing wrong or in what they said it was witty 
and might have been funny but it lacked just that 
something which is the of mirth and they were not 
even aware that such a thing  after dinner daughter 
and her governess rose he the little girl with his 
white hand and kissed her and that gesture too seemed 
unnatural to prince andrew  the men remained at table 
over their fashion in the midst of a conversation that 
was started about napoleon affairs which they all agreed in 
prince andrew began to express a contrary opinion smiled and 
with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking 
an unpleasant course told a story that had no connection 
with the previous conversation for a few moments all were 
silent  having sat some time at table a bottle 
of wine and  good wine in a carriage and 
pair passed it to the and got up all rose 
and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room 
two brought by a courier were to and he took 
them to his study as soon as he had left 
the room the general stopped and the guests began to 
converse and quietly with one another   for the 
said on returning from his study  wonderful talent he 
said to prince andrew and immediately assumed a and began 
some verses in french which he had about well petersburg 
people he was interrupted several times by when the verses 
were finished prince andrew went up to and took his 
leave   are you off to so early asked 
  promised to go to a reception  they 
said no more prince andrew looked into those eyes and 
felt that it had been of him to have expected 
anything from and from any of his own connected with 
him or ever to have importance to what was doing 
that laughter rang in prince andrew ears long after he 
had left the house  when he reached home prince 
andrew began thinking of his life in petersburg during those 
last four months as if it were something new he 
recalled his and and the history of his of army 
reform which had been for consideration and which they were 
trying to pass over in silence simply because another a 
very poor one had already been prepared and to the 
emperor he thought of the of a of which berg 
was a member he remembered how carefully and at what 
length everything to form and was discussed at those and 
how and all that related to the gist of the 
business was he recalled his on the and how he 
had the of the and french into russian and he 
felt ashamed of himself then he to himself his in 
the country his to he remembered the and the village 
elder and mentally applying to them the rights he had 
divided into he felt astonished that he could have spent 
so much time on such work     
 chapter xix   next day prince andrew called 
at a few he had not before and among them 
at the rostovs with whom he had acquaintance at the 
ball apart from of politeness which demanded the call he 
wanted to see that eager girl who had left such 
a pleasant on his mind in her own home  
natasha was one of the first to meet him she 
was wearing a dark house dress in which prince andrew 
thought her even prettier than in her ball dress she 
and all the rostov family him as an old friend 
simply and the whole family whom he had severely now 
seemed to him to of excellent simple and kindly people 
the old count and good nature which struck one especially 
in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that prince 
andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner  he 
thought  are capital people who of course have not 
the slightest idea what a treasure they in natasha but 
they are kindly and form the best possible setting for 
this strikingly charming girl with life  in natasha prince 
andrew was conscious of a strange world completely to him 
and of joys to him a different world that in 
the and at the window that night had already to 
him now this world disconcerted him no longer and was 
no longer to him but he himself having entered it 
found in it a new enjoyment  after dinner natasha 
at prince andrew request went to the clavichord and began 
prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies 
and listened to her in the midst of a phrase 
he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears him a thing 
he had thought impossible for him he looked at natasha 
as she sang and something new and joyful in his 
soul he felt happy and at the same time sad 
he had absolutely nothing to about yet he was ready 
to what about his former love the little princess his 
his for the future yes and no the chief reason 
was a sense of the terrible contrast between something great 
and within him and that and material something that he 
and even she was this contrast on and yet him 
while she sang  as soon as natasha had finished 
she went up to him and asked how he liked 
her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling 
that she ought not to have asked it he smiled 
looking at her and said he liked her as he 
liked everything she did  prince andrew left the rostovs 
late in the evening he went to bed from habit 
but soon realized that he could not sleep having lit 
his he sat up in bed then got up then 
lay down again not at all by his his soul 
was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped 
out of a room into god own fresh air it 
did not enter his head that he was in love 
with natasha he was not thinking about her but only 
her to himself and in all life appeared in a 
new light  do i why do i in this 
frame when life all life with all its joys is 
open to me said he to himself and for the 
first time for a very long while he began making 
happy for the future he decided that he must attend 
to his son education by finding a tutor and putting 
the boy in his then he ought to retire from 
the service and go abroad and see england and  
must use my freedom while i feel so much strength 
and youth in me he said to himself  was 
right when he said one must believe in the of 
happiness in order to be happy and now i do 
believe in it let the dead their dead but while 
one has life one must live and be happy thought 
he      chapter xx   
one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew 
everybody in moscow and petersburg came to see him berg 
arrived in an uniform with his hair and brushed forward 
over his as the emperor alexander wore his hair  
 have just been to see the countess your wife 
she could not grant my request but i hope count 
i shall be more with you he said with a 
smile   is it you wish colonel i am 
at your service   have now quite settled in 
my new rooms count  said this with conviction that 
this information could not but be agreeable  so i 
wish to arrange just a small party for my own 
and my wife friends  smiled still more  wished 
to ask the countess and you to do me the 
honor of coming to tea and to supper  only 
countess helene considering the society of such people as the 
beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an 
invitation berg explained so clearly why he wanted to at 
his house a small but company and why this would 
give him pleasure and why though he spending money on 
cards or anything he was prepared to run into some 
for the sake of good society pierre could not refuse 
and promised to come   don be late count 
if i may to ask about ten minutes to eight 
please we shall make up a our general is coming 
he is very good to me we shall have supper 
count so you will do me the favor  contrary 
to his habit of being late pierre on that day 
arrived at the house not at ten but at fifteen 
minutes to eight  having prepared everything necessary for the 
party the were ready for their guests arrival  in 
their new clean and light study with its small and 
and new sat berg and his wife berg buttoned up 
in his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to 
her that one always could and should be acquainted with 
people above one because only then does one get satisfaction 
from   can get to know something you can 
ask for something see how i managed from my first 
 measured his life not by years but by  
comrades are still while i am only waiting for a 
to command a regiment and have the happiness to be 
your husband  rose and kissed vera hand and on 
the way to her out a turned corner of the 
 how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing 
how to choose my it goes without saying that one 
must be conscientious and  berg smiled with a sense 
of his superiority over a weak woman and paused reflecting 
that this dear wife of his was after all but 
a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes 
a man dignity what it was  vera at the 
same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her 
good conscientious husband who all the same understood life as 
to vera all men did berg by his wife thought 
all women weak and foolish vera only by her husband 
and from that observation that all men though they understand 
nothing and are and selfish common sense to themselves alone 
       to be a 
man   berg rose and embraced his wife carefully 
so as not to crush her lace for which he 
had paid a good kissing her straight on the lips 
  only thing is we have children too soon 
he continued following an of ideas   answered vera 
 don at all want that we must live for 
society   wore one exactly like this said berg 
pointing to the with a happy and kindly smile  
just then count bezukhov was announced husband and wife glanced 
at one another both smiling with self and each mentally 
the honor of this visit   is what comes 
of knowing how to make thought berg  is what 
comes of knowing how to conduct   please don 
interrupt me when i am the guests said vera  
i know what interests each of them and what to 
say to different people  berg smiled again   
can be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation said 
he  they received pierre in their small new drawing 
where it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing 
its and order so it was quite and not strange 
that berg having offered to disturb the of an armchair 
or of the sofa for his dear but being apparently 
on the matter himself left the visitor to the question 
of pierre disturbed the by moving a chair for himself 
and berg and vera immediately began their evening party interrupting 
each other in their to entertain their  vera having 
decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be 
with conversation about the french at once began berg having 
decided that masculine conversation was interrupted his wife remarks and 
touched on the question of the war with austria and 
jumped from the general subject to as to the made 
him to take part in the and the reasons why 
he had declined them though the conversation was very and 
vera was angry at the of the masculine both husband 
and wife felt with satisfaction that even if only one 
was present their evening had very well and was as 
like as two to every other evening party with its 
talk tea and lighted candles  before long boris berg 
old arrived there was a of condescension and in his 
of berg and vera after boris came a lady with 
the colonel then the general himself then the rostovs and 
the party became exactly like all other evening parties berg 
and vera could not their smiles of satisfaction at the 
sight of all this movement in their drawing room at 
the sound of the talk the rustling of dresses and 
the and scraping everything was just as everybody always has 
it especially so the general who the berg on the 
shoulder and with the setting out of the table for 
boston the general sat down by count ilya rostov who 
was next to himself the most important the old people 
sat with the old the young with the young and 
the hostess at the tea table on which stood exactly 
the same kind of in a silver as the had 
at their party everything was just as it was everywhere 
else      chapter   pierre 
as one of the guests had to sit down to 
boston with count rostov the general and the colonel at 
the card table he happened to be facing natasha and 
was struck by a change that had come over her 
since the ball she was silent and not only less 
pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness 
by her look of gentle indifference to everything around  
 the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her 
she was sitting by her sister at the tea table 
and reluctantly without looking at him made some reply to 
boris who sat down beside her after playing out a 
whole suit and to his partner taking five pierre hearing 
greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the 
room while he was picking up his glanced again at 
natasha   has happened to her he asked himself 
with still greater surprise  prince andrew was standing before 
her saying something to her with a look of tender 
she having raised her head was looking up at him 
flushed and evidently trying to her breathing and the bright 
glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was 
again in her she was completely and from a plain 
girl had again become what she had been at the 
ball  prince andrew went up to pierre and the 
latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend 
face  pierre changed places several times during the game 
sitting now with his back to natasha and now facing 
her but during the whole of the six he watched 
her and his friend   very important is between 
them thought pierre and a feeling that was both joyful 
and painful agitated him and made him the game  
after six the general got up saying that it was 
no use playing like that and pierre was natasha on 
one side was talking with sonya and boris and vera 
with a subtle smile was saying something to prince andrew 
pierre went up to his friend and asking whether they 
were talking secrets sat down beside them vera having noticed 
prince andrew attentions to natasha decided that at a party 
a real evening party subtle to the tender were absolutely 
necessary and a moment when prince andrew was alone began 
a conversation with him about in general and about her 
sister with so intellectual a as she considered prince andrew 
to be she felt that she had to her tact 
 when pierre went up to them he noticed that 
vera was being carried away by her self talk but 
that prince andrew seemed a thing that happened with him 
  do you think vera was saying with an 
smile  are so prince and understand people so well 
at a glance what do you think of could she 
be constant in her could she like other women  
meant herself  a man once for all and remain 
true to him forever that is what i consider true 
love what do you think prince   know your 
sister too little replied prince andrew with a sarcastic smile 
under which he wished to hide his embarrassment  be 
able to solve so delicate a question and then i 
have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the 
more constant she is likely to be he added and 
looked up at pierre who was just approaching them  
 that is true prince in our days continued vera 
 days as people of intelligence are fond of doing 
that they have discovered and the of  days and 
that human change with the times our days a girl 
has so much freedom that the pleasure of being often 
real feeling in her and it must be that is 
very this return to the subject of prince andrew to 
his brows with he was about to rise but vera 
continued with a still more subtle smile   think 
no one has been more than she she went on 
 till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone 
now you know count she said to pierre  our 
dear cousin boris who between ourselves was very far gone 
in the land of tenderness  to a map of 
love much in vogue at that time  prince andrew 
frowned and remained silent   are friendly with boris 
you asked vera   i know him   
expect he has told you of his childish love for 
natasha   there was childish love suddenly asked prince 
andrew blushing unexpectedly   you know between cousins often 
leads to love le est un voisinage  don you 
think so         
is a dangerous neighborhood    said prince andrew 
and with and unnatural he began pierre about the need 
to be very with his fifty moscow cousins and in 
the midst of these remarks he rose taking pierre by 
the arm and drew him aside   asked pierre 
seeing his friend strange animation with surprise and noticing the 
glance he turned on natasha as he rose   
must i must have a talk with you said prince 
andrew  know that pair of women gloves  to 
the gloves given to a newly brother to present to 
the woman he loved  but no i will talk 
to you later on and with a strange light in 
his eyes and in his movements prince andrew approached natasha 
and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew 
asked her something and how she flushed as she replied 
 but at that moment berg came to pierre and 
began insisting that he should take part in an between 
the general and the colonel on the affairs in  
berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never 
left his face the party was very and quite like 
other parties he had seen everything was the ladies subtle 
talk the cards the general raising his voice at the 
card table and the samovar and the tea only one 
thing was that he had always seen at the evening 
parties he wished to they had not yet had a 
loud conversation among the men and a about something important 
and clever now the general had such a and so 
berg drew pierre to it      
chapter   next day having been by the count 
prince andrew with the rostovs and spent the rest of 
the day there  everyone in the house realized for 
whose sake prince andrew came and without concealing it he 
tried to be with natasha all day not only in 
the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha 
but in the whole house there was a feeling of 
at something important that was to happen the countess looked 
with sad and sternly serious eyes at prince andrew when 
he talked to natasha and timidly started some artificial conversation 
about trifles as soon as he looked her way sonya 
was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in 
the way when she was with them natasha grew pale 
in a of when she remained alone with him for 
a moment prince andrew surprised her by his she felt 
that he wanted to say something to her but could 
not bring himself to do so  in the evening 
when prince andrew had left the countess went up to 
natasha and whispered  what   for heaven sake 
don ask me anything now one can talk about that 
said natasha  but all the same that night natasha 
now agitated and now frightened lay a long time in 
her mother bed gazing straight before her she told her 
how he had her how he told her he was 
going abroad asked her where they were going to spend 
the summer and then how he had asked her about 
boris   such a such a never happened to 
me before she said  i feel afraid in his 
presence i am always afraid when i with him what 
does that mean does it mean that it the real 
thing yes mamma are you   my love i 
am frightened myself answered her mother  go   
the same i sleep what to sleep such a thing 
never happened to me before she said surprised and alarmed 
at the feeling she was aware of in herself  
could we ever have thought  it seemed to natasha 
that even at the time she first saw prince andrew 
at she had in love with him it was as 
if she feared this strange happiness of meeting again the 
very man she had then  was firmly convinced she 
had done so and of finding him as it seemed 
not indifferent to her   it had to happen 
that he should come specially to petersburg while we are 
here and it had to happen that we should meet 
at that ball it is fate clearly it is fate 
that everything led up to this already then i saw 
him i felt something peculiar   else did he 
say to you what are those verses read them said 
her mother referring to some verses prince andrew had written 
in natasha   one need not be ashamed of 
his being a   natasha to god  are 
made in heaven said her mother   how i 
love you how happy i am cried natasha tears of 
joy and excitement and embracing her mother  at that 
very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling 
him of his love for natasha and his firm to 
make her his wife  that day countess helene had 
a reception at her house the french ambassador was there 
and a foreign prince of the blood who had of 
late become a visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies 
and gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the 
rooms and struck everyone by his absent and air  
since the ball he had felt the of a fit 
of nervous and had made desperate to it since the 
of his wife with the prince pierre had unexpectedly been 
made a of the and from that time he had 
to feel and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts 
of the vanity of all things human came to him 
than before at the same time the feeling he had 
noticed between his natasha and prince andrew his by the 
contrast between his own position and his friend he tried 
to avoid thinking about his wife and about natasha and 
prince andrew and again everything seemed to him insignificant in 
with again the question for what itself and he forced 
himself to work day and night at to drive away 
the spirit that him toward after he had left the 
countess apartments he was sitting upstairs in a gown copying 
out the of the of at a table in his 
low room with tobacco smoke when someone came in it 
was prince andrew   it you said pierre with 
a dissatisfied air  i you see am hard at 
it he pointed to his book with that air of 
escaping from the of life with which unhappy people look 
at their work  prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic 
expression of life on his face paused in front of 
pierre and not noticing his sad look smiled at him 
with the egotism of joy   dear heart said 
he  wanted to tell you about it yesterday and 
i have come to do so today i never experienced 
anything like it before i am in love my friend 
 suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and his heavy 
person down on the sofa beside prince andrew   
natasha rostova yes said he   yes who else 
should it be i should never have believed it but 
the feeling is than i yesterday i tormented myself and 
but i would not even that for anything in the 
world i have not lived till now at last i 
live but i can live without her but can she 
love me i am too old for her why don 
you speak   i what did i tell you 
said pierre suddenly rising and beginning to up and down 
the room  always thought it that girl is such 
a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend 
i entreat you don don doubt marry marry marry and 
i am sure there will not be a happier man 
than you   what of her   you 
  talk said prince andrew smiling and looking into 
pierre eyes   does i know pierre cried  
 do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the 
arm  you know the condition i am in i 
must talk about it to someone   go on 
go on i am very glad said pierre and his 
face really changed his became and he listened to prince 
andrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different 
quite a new man where was his his for life 
his pierre was the only person to whom he made 
up his mind to speak and to him he told 
all that was in his soul now he boldly and 
lightly made for an future said he could not sacrifice 
his own happiness to his father and spoke of how 
he would either make his father consent to this and 
love her or would do without his consent then he 
at the feeling that had him as at something strange 
apart from and of himself   should not have 
believed anyone who told me that i was capable of 
such love said prince andrew  is not at all 
the same feeling that i knew in the past the 
whole world is now for me divided into two one 
half is she and there all is joy hope light 
the other half is everything where she is not and 
there is all and   and pierre  yes 
i understand that   cannot help the light it 
is not my and i am very happy you understand 
me i know you are glad for my sake  
 yes pierre looking at his friend with a touched 
and sad expression in his eyes the prince andrew lot 
appeared to him the seemed his own    
  chapter   prince andrew his father consent 
to his and to obtain this he started for the 
country next day  his father received his son with 
but he could not how anyone could wish to his 
life or introduce anything new into it when his own 
life was already ending  only they would let me 
end my days as i want to thought the old 
man  they might do as they please with his 
son however he employed the he for important and a 
quiet tone discussed the whole matter  in the first 
place the was not a brilliant one as wealth or 
rank prince andrew was no longer as young as he 
had been and his health was poor  old man 
laid special on this while she was very young he 
had a son whom it would be a pity to 
to a of a girl  and finally the father 
said looking ironically at his son  beg you to 
put it off for a year go abroad take a 
look out as you wanted to for a german tutor 
for prince nicholas then if your love or or you 
please still as great marry and that my last word 
on it mind the last concluded the prince in a 
tone which showed that nothing would make him his decision 
 prince andrew saw clearly that the old man that 
his or his would not stand a year test or 
that he  old prince himself would die before then 
and he decided to to his father wish and the 
for a year  three after the last evening he 
had spent with the rostovs prince andrew returned to petersburg 
  next day after her talk with her mother 
natasha expected bolkonski all day but he did not come 
on the second and third day it was the same 
pierre did not come either and natasha not knowing that 
prince andrew had gone to see his father could not 
explain his to herself  three passed in this way 
natasha had no desire to go out anywhere and from 
room to room like a and listless she wept secretly 
at night and did not go to her mother in 
the she blushed continually and was it seemed to her 
that everybody knew about her and was laughing at her 
and her strong as was her this wound to her 
vanity her  once she came to her mother tried 
to say something and suddenly began to cry her tears 
were those of an offended child who does not know 
why it is being  the countess began to soothe 
natasha who after first listening to her mother words suddenly 
interrupted her   off mamma i don think and 
don want to think about it he just came and 
then left off left off  her voice trembled and 
she again nearly cried but and went on quietly  
 i don at all want to get married and 
i am afraid of him i have now become quite 
calm quite calm  the day after this conversation natasha 
put on the old dress which she knew had the 
peculiar property of to in the and that day she 
returned to the old way of life which she had 
since the ball having finished her morning tea she went 
to the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud 
and began her when she had finished her first exercise 
she stood still in the middle of the room and 
sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her she listened 
joyfully  though she had not expected it to the 
of the notes filling the whole empty ballroom and slowly 
dying away and all at once she felt cheerful  
the good of making so much of it things are 
nice as it is she said to herself and she 
began up and down the room not simply on the 
but with each step from the to the  had 
on a new and favorite pair of shoes and listening 
to the regular of the and creak of the as 
as she had to the sounds of her own voice 
passing a mirror she glanced into it  that me 
the expression of her face seemed to say as she 
caught sight of herself  and very nice too i 
need  a footman wanted to come in to clear 
away something in the room but she would not let 
him and having closed the door behind him continued her 
walk that morning she had returned to her favorite mood 
of and in herself  charming that natasha is she 
said again speaking as some third male person  a 
good voice young and in way if only they leave 
her in peace but however much they left her in 
peace she could not now be at peace and immediately 
felt this  in the hall the porch door opened 
and someone asked  home and then footsteps were heard 
natasha was looking at the mirror but did not see 
herself she listened to the sounds in the hall when 
she saw herself her face was pale it was he 
she knew this for certain though she hardly heard his 
voice through the closed doors  pale and agitated natasha 
ran into the drawing room   bolkonski has come 
she said  it is awful it is i don 
want to be tormented what am i to do  
before the countess could answer prince andrew entered the room 
with an agitated and serious face as soon as he 
saw natasha his face brightened he kissed the countess hand 
and natasha and sat down beside the sofa   
is long since we had the pleasure began the countess 
but prince andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question 
obviously in to say what he had to   
have not been to see you all this time because 
i have been at my father i had to talk 
over a very important matter with him i only got 
back last night he said glancing at natasha  want 
to have a talk with you countess he added after 
a moment pause  the countess lowered her eyes sighing 
deeply   am at your disposal she murmured  
natasha knew that she ought to go away but was 
unable to do so something her and of manners she 
stared straight at prince andrew with wide eyes   
once this instant no it can be she thought  
again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her 
that she was not mistaken yes at once that very 
instant her fate would be decided   natasha i 
will call you said the countess in a whisper  
natasha glanced with frightened eyes at prince andrew and at 
her mother and went out   have come countess 
to ask for your daughter hand said prince andrew  
the countess face flushed but she said nothing   
she began at last he remained silent looking into her 
eyes   grew confused  agreeable to us and 
i accept your i am glad and my husband i 
hope but it will on her   will speak 
to her when i have your consent do you give 
it to me said prince andrew   replied the 
countess she held out her hand to him and with 
a mixed feeling of and tenderness pressed her lips to 
his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand she 
wished to love him as a son but felt that 
to her he was a stranger and a man  
am sure my husband will consent said the countess  
your father   father to whom i have told 
my has made it an express condition of his consent 
that the is not to take place for a year 
and i wished to tell you of that said prince 
andrew   is true that natasha is still young 
but long as that   is said prince andrew 
with a sigh   will send her to you 
said the countess and left the room   have 
mercy upon us she repeated while her daughter  sonya 
said that natasha was in her natasha was sitting on 
the bed pale and dry and was gazing at the 
and something as she rapidly herself seeing her mother she 
jumped up and to her   mamma well  
 go to him he is asking for your hand 
said the countess coldly it seemed to natasha  go 
said the mother sadly and with a deep sigh as 
her daughter ran away  natasha never remembered how she 
entered the drawing room when she came in and saw 
him she paused  it possible that this stranger has 
now become everything to me she asked herself and immediately 
answered  everything he alone is now to me than 
everything in the world prince andrew came up to her 
with eyes   have loved you from the very 
first moment i saw you may i hope  he 
looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned 
expression of her face her face said  ask why 
doubt what you cannot but know why speak when words 
cannot express what one  she drew near to him 
and stopped he took her hand and kissed it  
 you love me   yes natasha murmured as 
if in vexation then she loudly and her more and 
more quickly began to sob   is it what 
the matter   i am so happy she replied 
smiled through her tears bent over closer to him paused 
for an instant as if asking herself whether she might 
and then kissed him  prince andrew held her hands 
looked into her eyes and did not find in his 
heart his former love for her something in him had 
suddenly changed there was no longer the former and of 
desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish 
weakness fear at her devotion and and an yet joyful 
sense of the duty that now him to her forever 
the present feeling though not so bright and as the 
former was and more serious   your mother tell 
you that it cannot be for a year asked prince 
andrew still looking into her eyes   it possible 
that i  of a girl as everybody called me 
thought natasha it possible that i am now to be 
the wife and the equal of this strange dear clever 
man whom even my father looks up to can it 
be true can it be true that there can be 
no more playing with life that now i am grown 
up that on me now lies a responsibility for my 
every word and deed yes but what did he ask 
me   she replied but she had not understood 
his question   me he said  you are 
so young and i have already been through so much 
in life i am afraid for you you do not 
yet know yourself  natasha listened with concentrated attention trying 
but to take in the meaning of his words  
 as this year which my happiness will be continued 
prince andrew  will give you time to be sure 
of yourself i ask you to make me happy in 
a year but you are free our shall remain a 
secret and should you find that you do not love 
me or should you come to love said prince andrew 
with an unnatural smile   do you say that 
natasha interrupted him  know that from the very day 
you first came to i have loved you she cried 
quite convinced that she spoke the truth   a 
year you will learn to know yourself   whole 
year natasha repeated suddenly only now that the was to 
be for a year  why a year why a 
year  prince andrew began to explain to her the 
reasons for this delay natasha did not hear him  
 can it be helped she asked prince andrew did 
not reply but his face expressed the impossibility of altering 
that decision   awful oh it awful awful natasha 
suddenly cried and again burst into  shall die waiting 
a year it impossible it awful she looked into her 
face and saw in it a look of and  
 no i do anything she said suddenly her tears 
 am so happy  the father and mother came 
into the room and gave the their  from that 
day prince andrew began to the rostovs as natasha  
    chapter   no ceremony took 
place and natasha to bolkonski was not announced prince andrew 
on that he said that as he was for the 
delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it 
that he had given his word and himself forever but 
that he did not wish to natasha and gave her 
freedom if after six months she felt that she did 
not love him she would have full right to him 
naturally neither natasha nor her parents wished to hear of 
this but prince andrew was firm he came every day 
to the rostovs but did not behave to natasha as 
an he did not use the familiar but said you 
to her and kissed only her hand after their quite 
different intimate and natural relations up between them it was 
as if they had not known each other till now 
both liked to how they had regarded each other when 
as yet they were nothing to one another they felt 
themselves now quite different then they were artificial now natural 
and sincere at first the family felt some in intercourse 
with prince andrew he seemed a man from another world 
and for a long time natasha the family to get 
used to him them all that he only appeared to 
be different but was really just like all of them 
and that she was not afraid of him and no 
one else ought to be after a few days they 
grew accustomed to him and without in his presence their 
usual way of life in which he took his part 
he could talk about with the count with the countess 
and natasha and about and with sonya sometimes the household 
both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder 
at how it had all happened and at the evident 
there had been of it prince andrew coming to and 
their coming to petersburg and the between natasha and prince 
andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit 
and andrew with nicholas in  and many other that 
it had to be  in the house that and 
quiet which always the presence of a often when all 
sitting together everyone kept silent sometimes the others would get 
up and go away and the left alone still remained 
silent they spoke of their future life prince andrew was 
afraid and ashamed to speak of it natasha this as 
she did all his which she constantly once she began 
him about his son prince andrew blushed as he often 
did now particularly liked it in him said that his 
son would not live with them   not asked 
natasha in a frightened tone   cannot take him 
away from his and besides   i should have 
loved him said natasha immediately his thought  i know 
you wish to avoid any pretext for finding with us 
 sometimes the old count would come up kiss prince 
andrew and ask his advice about petya education or nicholas 
service the old countess as she looked at them sonya 
was always getting frightened she should be in the way 
and tried to find for leaving them alone even when 
they did not wish it when prince andrew spoke  
could tell a story very well natasha listened to him 
with pride when she spoke she noticed with fear and 
joy that he gazed attentively and at her she asked 
herself in  does he look for in me he 
is trying to something by looking at me what if 
what he seeks in me is not there sometimes she 
fell into one of the mad merry of her and 
then she particularly loved to hear and see how prince 
andrew laughed he laughed but when he did he himself 
entirely to his laughter and after such a laugh she 
always felt nearer to him natasha would have been completely 
happy if the thought of the awaiting her and drawing 
near had not terrified her just as the mere thought 
of it made him turn pale and cold  on 
the of his from petersburg prince andrew brought with him 
pierre who had not been to the rostovs once since 
the ball pierre seemed disconcerted and he was talking to 
the countess and natasha sat down beside a little table 
with sonya inviting prince andrew to come too he did 
so   have known bezukhov a long time he 
asked  you like him   he a dear 
but very absurd  and as usual when speaking of 
pierre she began to tell of his absent some of 
which had even been about him   you know 
i have him with our secret i have known him 
from childhood he has a heart of gold i beg 
you prince andrew said with am going away and heaven 
knows what may happen you may to all right i 
know i am not to say that only this then 
may happen to you when i am not here  
 can happen   trouble may come prince andrew 
continued  beg you mademoiselle may happen to turn to 
him alone for advice and help he is a most 
absent and absurd fellow but he has a heart of 
gold  neither her father nor her mother nor sonya 
nor prince andrew himself could have how the from her 
would act on natasha flushed and agitated she went about 
the house all that day dry occupied with most trivial 
matters as if not understanding what her she did not 
even cry when on taking leave he kissed her hand 
for the last time  go she said in a 
tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not 
to stay and which he remembered long afterwards nor did 
she cry when he was gone but for several days 
she sat in her room dry taking no interest in 
anything and only saying now and then  why did 
he go away  but a after his to the 
surprise of those around her she from her mental just 
as suddenly and became her old self again but with 
a change in her as a child gets up after 
a long illness with a changed expression of face  
    chapter   during that year 
after his son prince nicholas bolkonski health and became much 
worse he grew still more and it was princess mary 
who generally bore the of his fits of anger he 
seemed carefully to out her tender so as to torture 
her mentally as as possible princess mary had two and 
two joys little nicholas and these were the favorite of 
the prince and was spoken of he would bring round 
to the of old maids or the and spoiling of 
children  want to make him nicholas an old maid 
like yourself a pity prince andrew wants a son and 
not an old maid he would say or turning to 
mademoiselle he would ask her in princess mary presence how 
she liked our village and and would joke about them 
 he continually hurt princess mary and tormented her but 
it cost her no effort to forgive him could he 
be to toward her or could her father whom she 
knew loved her in spite of it all be and 
what is the princess never thought of that proud word 
 all the of man for her in one clear 
and simple law law of love and self taught us 
by him who for mankind though he himself was god 
what had she to do with the or of other 
people she had to endure and love and that she 
did  during the winter prince andrew had come to 
bald hills and had been gay gentle and more affectionate 
than princess mary had known him for a long time 
past she felt that something had happened to him but 
he said nothing to her about his love before he 
left he had a long talk with his father about 
something and princess mary noticed that before his they were 
dissatisfied with one another  soon after prince andrew had 
gone princess mary wrote to her friend julie karagina in 
petersburg whom she had  all girls of marrying to 
her brother and who was at that time in mourning 
for her own brother killed in   sorrow it 
seems is our common lot my dear tender friend julie 
 your is so terrible that i can only explain 
it to myself as a special of god who you 
wishes to try you and your excellent mother oh my 
friend and alone can will not say us save us 
from despair alone can explain to us what without its 
help man cannot why for what cause kind and noble 
able to find happiness in life merely no one but 
necessary to the happiness of others called away to god 
while cruel persons or such as are a burden to 
themselves and to others are left living the first death 
i saw and one i shall never forget of my 
dear sister that on me just as you ask destiny 
why your splendid brother had to die so i asked 
why that lise who not only never anyone but in 
whose soul there were never any thoughts had to die 
and what do you think dear friend five years have 
passed since then and already i with my understanding begin 
to see clearly why she had to die and in 
what way that death was but an expression of the 
goodness of the whose every though generally to us is 
but a of his love for his perhaps i often 
think she was too innocent to have the strength to 
perform all a mother duties as a young wife she 
was perhaps she could not have been so as a 
mother as it is not only has she left us 
and particularly prince andrew with the and but probably she 
will there receive a place i not hope for myself 
but not to speak of her alone that early and 
terrible death has had the most influence on me and 
on my brother in spite of all our then at 
the moment of our these thoughts could not occur to 
me i should then have dismissed them with horror but 
now they are very clear and certain i write all 
this to you dear friend only to you of the 
truth which has become for me a of life not 
a single hair of our heads will fall without his 
will and his will is only by love for us 
and so us is for our good  you ask 
whether we shall spend next winter in moscow in spite 
of my wish to see you i do not think 
so and do not want to do so you will 
be surprised to hear that the reason for this is 
buonaparte the case is this my father health is growing 
worse he cannot stand any and is becoming this is 
as you know chiefly to political questions he cannot endure 
the that buonaparte is on equal terms with all the 
sovereigns of europe and particularly with our own the of 
the great catherine as you know i am quite indifferent 
to politics but from my father remarks and his with 
michael i know all that goes on in the world 
and especially about the on buonaparte who only at bald 
hills in the whole world it seems is not as 
a great man still less as emperor of france and 
my father cannot stand this it seems to me that 
it is chiefly because of his political views that my 
father is to speak of going to moscow for he 
the that would result from his way of expressing his 
views of anybody all the he might from a course 
of he would lose as a result of the about 
buonaparte which would be in any case it will be 
decided very  our family life goes on in the 
old way except for my brother andrew he as i 
wrote you before has changed very much of late after 
his sorrow he only this year quite his he has 
again become as i used to know him when a 
child kind affectionate with that heart of gold to which 
i know no equal he has realized it seems to 
me that life is not over for him but together 
with this mental change he has grown physically much he 
has become and more nervous i am anxious about him 
and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the 
doctors recommended long ago i hope it will him you 
write that in petersburg he is spoken of as one 
of the most active and capable of the young men 
forgive my vanity as a relation but i never it 
the good he has done to everybody here from his 
up to the is on his arrival in petersburg he 
received only his i always wonder at the way fly 
from petersburg to moscow especially such ones as that you 
write about mean the report of my brother to the 
little rostova i do not think my brother will ever 
marry again and certainly not her and this is why 
first i know that though he about the wife he 
has lost the of that has gone too deep in 
his heart for him ever to decide to give her 
a and our little a because as far as i 
know that girl is not the kind of girl who 
could please prince andrew i do not think he would 
choose her for a wife and i do not wish 
it but i am running on too long and am 
at the end of my second good my dear friend 
may god keep you in his and care my dear 
friend mademoiselle you  mary      
chapter   in the middle of the summer princess 
mary received an letter from prince andrew in in which 
he gave her strange and surprising news he her of 
his to natasha rostova the whole letter for his and 
tender and affection for his sister he wrote that he 
had never loved as he did now and that only 
now did he understand and know what life was he 
asked his sister to forgive him for not having told 
her of his when he had last bald hills though 
he had spoken of it to his father he had 
not done so for fear princess mary should ask her 
father to give his consent irritating him and having to 
bear the of his without her object  he wrote 
 matter was not then so settled as it is 
now my father then on a delay of a year 
and now already six months half of that period have 
passed and my resolution is than ever if the doctors 
did not keep me here at the i should be 
back in russia but as it is i have to 
my return for three months you know me and my 
relations with father i want nothing from him i have 
been and always shall be but to go against his 
will and his anger now that he may perhaps remain 
with us such a short time would half my happiness 
i am now to him about the same question and 
beg you to choose a good moment to hand him 
the letter and to let me know how he looks 
at the whole matter and whether there is hope that 
he may consent to the by four months  after 
long and princess mary gave the letter to her father 
the next day the old prince said to her quietly 
  and tell your brother to wait till i 
am dead it won be long shall soon set him 
free  the princess was about to reply but her 
father would not let her speak and raising his voice 
more and more cried   marry my boy a 
good family clever people eh rich eh yes a nice 
little nicholas will have write and tell him that he 
may marry tomorrow if he she will be little nicholas 
and i marry he be without a either only one 
thing no more women are wanted in my house him 
marry and live by himself perhaps you will go and 
live with him too he added turning to princess mary 
 in name go out into the the the  
after this outburst the prince did not speak any more 
about the matter but vexation at his son poor behavior 
found expression in his of his daughter to his former 
for irony a fresh one was now added to and 
to mademoiselle   i marry her he asked his 
daughter  make a splendid princess  and to her 
surprise and princess mary noticed that her father was really 
more and more with the she wrote to prince andrew 
about the reception of his letter but him with of 
their father to the idea  little nicholas and his 
education her brother andrew and were princess mary joys and 
but besides that since everyone must have princess mary in 
the of her heart had a and hope that the 
chief of her life this comforting and hope were given 
her by god half and other who her without the 
prince knowledge the longer she lived the more experience and 
observation she had of life the greater was her wonder 
at the short of men who enjoyment and happiness here 
on earth suffering and one another to obtain that impossible 
happiness prince andrew had loved his wife she died but 
that was not enough he wanted to his happiness to 
another woman her father to this because he wanted a 
more distinguished and match for andrew and they all and 
and tormented one another and their their for the attainment 
of which endure but for an instant not only do 
we know this ourselves but the son of god came 
down to earth and told us that this life is 
but for a moment and is a yet we to 
it and think to find happiness in it  is 
it that no one this thought princess mary  one 
except these god who on back come to me by 
the back door afraid of being seen by the prince 
not for fear of ill by him but for fear 
of causing him to sin to leave family home and 
all the cares of welfare in order without to anything 
to wander in from place to place under an assumed 
name doing no one any but for all those who 
drive one away as well as for those who one 
higher than that life and truth there is no life 
or truth  there was one a quiet little woman 
of fifty called who for over thirty years had gone 
about and worn heavy princess mary was particularly fond of 
her once when in a room with a lit before 
the was talking of her life the thought that alone 
had found the true path of life suddenly came to 
princess mary with such force that she to become a 
herself when had gone to sleep princess mary thought about 
this for a long time and at last made up 
her mind that strange as it might seem she must 
go on a she this thought to no one but 
to her father the and he of her intention under 
of a present for the princess mary prepared a complete 
for herself a coarse shoes a rough coat and a 
black often approaching the chest of drawers this secret treasure 
princess mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already 
come to put her into execution  often listening to 
the she was so by their simple speech to them 
but to her so full of deep meaning that several 
times she was on the point of everything and running 
away from home in she already herself by side dressed 
in coarse with a staff a on her back along 
the road her from one saint to another free from 
earthly love or desire and reaching at last the place 
where there is no more sorrow or sighing but joy 
and   shall come to a place and there 
and before having time to get used to it or 
getting to love it i shall go farther i will 
go on till my legs and i lie down and 
die somewhere and shall at last reach that quiet haven 
where there is neither sorrow nor sighing thought princess mary 
 but afterwards when she saw her father and especially 
little  her she wept quietly and felt that she 
was a sinner who loved her father and little more 
than god      book seven  
       chapter i  
 the tells us that the of a condition of 
the first man before the fall man has retained a 
love of but the weighs on the race not only 
because we have to our in the of our brows 
but because our nature is such that we cannot be 
both and at ease an inner voice tells us we 
are in the wrong if we are if man could 
find a state in which he felt that though he 
was his duty he would have found one of the 
of man and such a state of and is the 
lot of a whole class military the chief of military 
service has and will in this and  nicholas rostov 
experienced this condition to the full when after  he 
continued to serve in the pavlograd regiment in which he 
already the he had taken over from  rostov had 
become a good fellow whom his moscow would have considered 
rather bad form but who was liked and respected by 
his comrades and and was well with his life of 
late in  he found in from home more from 
his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and 
greater and that it was time for him to come 
back to and his old parents  reading these nicholas 
felt a of their to take him away from in 
which from all the of life he was living so 
and quietly he felt that sooner or later he would 
have to that of life with its and affairs to 
be out its accounts with and intrigues its society and 
with sonya love and his promise to her it was 
all difficult and and he replied to his mother in 
cold in french beginning  dear mamma and ending  
son which said nothing of when he would return in 
 he received from his parents in which they told 
him of natasha to bolkonski and that the would be 
in a year time because the old prince made difficulties 
this letter and mortified nicholas in the first place he 
was sorry that natasha for whom he cared more than 
for anyone else in the family should be lost to 
the home and from his hussar point of he not 
to have been there to show that fellow bolkonski that 
connection with him was no such great honor after all 
and that if he loved natasha he might with from 
his father for a moment he whether he should not 
apply for leave in order to see natasha before she 
was married but then came the and about sonya and 
about the of their affairs and nicholas again put it 
off but in the spring of that year he received 
a letter from his mother written without his father knowledge 
and that letter him to return she wrote that if 
he did not come and take matters in hand their 
whole property would be by and they would all have 
to go begging the count was so weak and so 
much and was so good that everybody took of him 
and things were going from bad to worse  god 
sake i you come at once if you do not 
wish to make me and the whole family wretched wrote 
the countess  this letter touched nicholas he had that 
common sense of a matter man which showed him what 
he ought to do  the right thing now was 
if not to retire from the service at any rate 
to go home on leave why he had to go 
he did not know but after his after nap he 
gave orders to an gray that had not been for 
a long time and when he returned with the horse 
all in a he  who had remained with him 
and his comrades who turned up in the evening that 
he was applying for leave and was going home difficult 
and strange as it was for him to that he 
would go away without having heard from the staff this 
interested him he was to a or would receive the 
order of st for the last strange as it was 
to think that he would go away without having his 
three to the count who was for the horses rostov 
had he would sell for two thousand rubles as it 
seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor 
of the mademoiselle  of to the who had given 
one in honor of their mademoiselle would take place without 
him knew he must go away from this good bright 
world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused a 
week later he obtained his leave his hussar comrades only 
those of his own regiment but the whole rostov a 
dinner to which the was fifteen rubles a head and 
at which there were two and two of rostov danced 
the with major the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped 
rostov the soldiers of the third tossed him too and 
shouted  and then they put him in his and 
him as far as the first post  during the 
first half of the to rostov thoughts as is usual 
in such were behind him with the but when he 
had gone more than halfway he began to forget his 
three and his and to wonder anxiously how things would 
be at and what he would find there thoughts of 
home grew the nearer he approached it as though this 
feeling of his was subject to the law by which 
the force of is in proportion to the square of 
the distance at the last post before he gave the 
a three and on he ran like a boy up 
the steps of his home  after the of meeting 
and after that feeling of feeling that  is just 
the same so why did i began to down in 
his old home world his father and mother were much 
the same only a little older what was new in 
them was a certain and which there used not to 
be and which as nicholas soon found out was to 
the bad state of their affairs sonya was nearly twenty 
she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more than 
she was already but that was enough she happiness and 
love from the time nicholas returned and the faithful love 
of this girl had a effect on him petya and 
natasha surprised nicholas most petya was a big handsome boy 
of thirteen merry witty and with a voice that was 
already breaking as for natasha for a long while nicholas 
wondered and laughed whenever he looked at her   
not the same at all he said   am 
i   the contrary but what dignity a princess 
he whispered to her   yes yes cried natasha 
joyfully  she told him about her with prince andrew 
and of his visit to and showed him his last 
letter   are you glad natasha asked  am 
so and happy now   glad answered nicholas  
is an excellent fellow and are you very much in 
love   shall i put it replied natasha  
was in love with boris with my teacher and with 
but this is quite different i feel at peace and 
settled i know that no better man than he and 
i am calm and now not at all as before 
 nicholas expressed his of the of the for a 
year but natasha attacked her brother with to him that 
it could not be and that it would be a 
bad thing to enter a family against the father will 
and that she herself wished it so   don 
at all understand she said  nicholas was silent and 
agreed with her  her brother often wondered as he 
looked at her she did not seem at all like 
a girl in love and from her husband she was 
even and calm and quite as cheerful as of old 
this nicholas and even made him regard bolkonski he could 
not believe that her fate was especially as he had 
not seen her with prince andrew it always seemed to 
him that there was something not quite right about this 
intended   this delay why no he thought once 
when he had touched on this topic with his mother 
he discovered to his surprise and to his satisfaction that 
in the of her soul she too had about this 
  see he writes said she showing her son 
a letter of prince andrew with that a mother always 
has in regard to a daughter future married happiness  
writes that he won come before what can be keeping 
him illness probably his health is very delicate don tell 
natasha and don importance to her being so bright that 
because she living through the last days of her but 
i know what she is like every time we receive 
a letter from him however god grant that everything out 
well  always ended with these words  is an 
excellent man      chapter ii  
 after reaching home nicholas was at first serious and 
even dull he was by the necessity of in the 
stupid business matters for which his mother had called him 
home to throw off this burden as quickly as possible 
on the third day after his arrival he went angry 
and scowling and without answering questions as to where he 
was going to and demanded an account of everything but 
what an account of everything might be nicholas knew even 
less than the frightened and the conversation and the of 
the accounts with did not last long the village elder 
a and the village clerk who were waiting in the 
passage heard with fear and first the young count voice 
and and rising louder and louder and then words of 
dreadful words one after the other   ungrateful i 
the dog to i not my father us and so 
on  then with no less fear and they saw 
how the young count red in the face and with 
eyes out by the of the neck and his foot 
and knee to his behind with great at moments between 
the words shouting  off never let me see your 
face here again you villain  down the six steps 
and ran away into the  was a well haven 
of for at himself returning tipsy from the town used 
to hide there and many of the at hiding from 
knew of its qualities  wife and sisters thrust their 
heads and frightened faces out of the door of a 
room where a bright samovar was and where the high 
stood with its  the young count paid no to 
them but breathing hard passed by with resolute and went 
into the house  the countess who heard at once 
from the maids what had happened at the was by 
the thought that now their affairs would certainly but on 
the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this 
excitement might have on her son she went several times 
to his door on and listened as he lighted one 
pipe after another  next day the old count called 
his son aside and with an smile said to him 
  you know my dear boy it a pity 
you got has told me all about it   
knew thought nicholas  i should never understand anything in 
this crazy world   were angry that he had 
not entered those  rubles but they were carried forward 
you did not look at the other page   
he is a and a i know he is and 
what i have done i have done but if you 
like i won speak to him again   my 
dear boy  count too felt he knew he had 
his wife property and was to toward his children but 
he did not know how to it  i beg 
you to attend to the business i am old i 
  papa forgive me if i have you i 
understand it all less than you do   take 
all these and money matters and forward from page to 
page he thought  used to understand what a  
and the at cards meant but carrying forward to another 
page i don understand at all said he to himself 
and after that he did not in business affairs but 
once the countess called her son and him that she 
had a note from anna mikhaylovna for two thousand rubles 
and asked him what he thought of doing with it 
  answered nicholas  say it with me well 
i don like anna mikhaylovna and i don like boris 
but they were our friends and poor well then this 
and he up the note and by so doing the 
old countess to tears of joy after that young rostov 
took no further part in any business affairs but devoted 
himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a 
new which his father kept a large    
  chapter iii   the weather was already 
growing and morning an earth by the had and its 
bright green stood out against the of winter trodden down 
by the cattle and against the pale of the spring 
the and the which at the end of august had 
still been green amid black and had become and bright 
amid the green winter the had already half changed their 
summer the were beginning to and the young were bigger 
than dogs it was the best time of the year 
for the the of that young rostov had not merely 
reached hard winter condition but were so that at a 
meeting of the it was decided to give them a 
three days rest and then on the of to go 
on a expedition starting from the oak where there was 
an of  all that day the remained at home 
it was and the air was sharp but toward evening 
the sky became and it began to on the when 
young rostov in his gown looked out of the window 
he saw it was an morning for hunting it was 
as if the sky were and to the earth without 
any wind the only motion in the air was that 
of the of the bare in the garden were with 
which fell on the leaves the earth in the kitchen 
garden looked and black and like and at a short 
distance into the dull of nicholas went out into the 
and porch there was a smell of leaves and of 
dog a black broad with prominent black eyes got up 
on seeing her her legs lay down like a and 
then suddenly jumped up and him right on his nose 
and mustache another a dog sight of his from the 
garden path his back and rushing toward the porch with 
lifted tail began rubbing himself against his legs   
came at that moment that call which the bass with 
the and round the corner came the head and head 
a gray wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over 
his forehead fashion a long bent in his hand and 
that look of and of everything that is only seen 
in he his cap to his and looked at him 
scornfully this was not offensive to his nicholas knew that 
this of everybody and who considered himself above them was 
all the same his and   nicholas said timidly 
conscious at the sight of the weather the and the 
that he was being carried away by that for which 
makes a man forget all his previous as a in 
the presence of his   orders your excellency said 
the in his deep bass deep as a and with 
two black eyes gazed from under his brows at his 
who was silent  you it those eyes seemed to 
be asking   a good day eh for a 
hunt and a eh asked nicholas behind the ears  
did not answer but instead   sent at dawn 
to listen his bass out after a minute pause  
says she moved them into the they were there  
meant that the she about whom they both knew had 
moved with her to the a small place a mile 
and a half from the house   ought to 
go don you think so said nicholas  to me 
with   you please   put off them 
  sir  five minutes later and were standing 
in nicholas big study though was not a big man 
to see him in a room was like seeing a 
horse or a bear on the floor among the and 
of human life himself felt this and as usual stood 
just inside the door trying to speak softly and not 
move for fear of breaking something in the and he 
hastened to say all that was necessary so as to 
get from under that out into the open under the 
sky once more  having finished his and from an 
opinion that the were fit  himself wished to go 
hunting nicholas ordered the horses to be but just as 
was about to go natasha came in with steps not 
having done up her hair or finished and with her 
old nurse big shawl wrapped round her petya ran in 
at the same time   are going asked natasha 
 knew you would sonya said you go but i 
knew that today is the sort of day when you 
couldn help going   we are going replied nicholas 
reluctantly for today as he intended to hunt seriously he 
did not want to take natasha and petya  are 
going but only hunting it would be dull for you 
  know it is my greatest pleasure said natasha 
 not fair you are going by yourself are having 
the horses and said nothing to us about it

them to for us and michael must come with my 
dogs she added to the  it seemed to and 
to be in a room at all but to have 
anything to do with a young lady seemed to him 
impossible he down his eyes and hurried out as if 
it were none of his business as he went not 
to any on the young lady     
 chapter iv   the old count who had 
always kept up an enormous hunting but had now it 
all completely over to his son care being in very 
good on this of prepared to go out with the 
others  in an hour time the whole hunting party 
was at the porch nicholas with a stern and serious 
air which showed that now was no time for to

tell him something he had a look at all the 
of the hunt sent a of and on to find 
the his and to his own of set off across 
the ground to a field leading to the wood the 
old count horse a called was led by the in 
on him while the count himself was to drive in 
a small trap straight to a spot for him  
they were taking fifty with six hunt and besides the 
family there were eight and more than forty so that 
with the on the belonging to members of the family 
there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty 
 each dog knew its and its call each man 
in the hunt knew his business his place what he 
had to do as soon as they had passed the 
they all spread out and quietly without noise or talk 
along the road and field leading to the  the 
horses stepped over the field as over a thick now 
and then into as they a road the sky still 
seemed to and toward the earth the air was still 
warm and silent occasionally the of a the of a 
horse the of a or the of a could be 
heard  when they had gone a little less than 
a mile five more with dogs appeared out of the 
approaching the rostovs in front a fresh handsome old man 
with a large gray mustache   morning uncle said 
nicholas when the old man drew near   it

to her by michael a and by a appointed to 
look after her petya who was laughing and pulled at 
his horse natasha sat easily and on her black and 
him in without effort with a firm hand

 what a fine dog is he knew me said 
natasha referring to her favorite   the first place

sternly at his sister trying to make her feel the 
distance that ought to separate them at that moment natasha 
understood it   think we be in anyone way 
uncle she said  go to our places and won 
  good thing too little countess said   
mind you don fall off your horse he added  
it come on nothing to hold on to  the 
of the came in sight a few hundred off the 
were already it rostov having finally settled with  where 
they should set on the and having shown natasha where 
she was to stand spot where nothing could possibly run 
out round above the   you going for a 
big said   and don let her slip  
 as may happen answered rostov  here he shouted 
answering  remark by this call to his was a 
old dog with a hanging famous for having a big 
they all took up their places  the old count 
knowing his son in the hunt hurried so as not 
to be late and the had not yet reached their 
places when count ilya rostov cheerful flushed and with quivering 
drove up with his black horses over the winter to 
the place for him where a might come out having 
his coat and on his hunting knives and he his 
good well and comfortable horse which was turning gray like 
himself his horses and trap were sent home count ilya 
rostov though not at heart a knew the of the 
hunt well and to the edge of the road where 
he was to stand arranged his settled himself in the 
and feeling that he was ready looked about with a 
smile  beside him was his an old now in 
the held in three who had however grown fat like 
their and his horse two old dogs lay down some 
hundred farther along the edge of the wood stood the 
count other a daring and to before the hunt by 
old custom the count had drunk a silver of taken 
a and washed it down with half a bottle of 
his favorite  he was flushed with the wine and 
the drive his eyes were rather and more than usual 
and as he sat in his wrapped up in his 
coat he looked like a child taken out for an 
 the thin hollow having got everything ready kept glancing 
at his with whom he had lived on the best 
of terms for thirty years and understanding the mood he 
was in expected a pleasant a third person up through 
the wood  was plain that he had had a 
and stopped behind the count this person was a gray 
old man in a woman cloak with a tall cap 
on his head he was the who went by a 
woman name ivanovna   ivanovna whispered the count winking 
at him  you away the give it you  
 know a thing or two myself said ivanovna  
 whispered the count and turned to  you seen 
the young countess he asked  is she   
young count peter by the rank grass answered smiling  
she a lady she very fond of hunting   
you surprised at the way she eh said the count 
 as good as many a man   course 
it so bold so easy   nicholas where is 
he by the isn he   sir he knows 
where to stand he the matter so well that and 
i are often quite said well knowing what would please 
his   well eh and how well he looks 
on his horse eh   picture how he a 
out of the rank grass by the the other day 
a place what a sight when they rushed from the 
the horse worth a thousand rubles and the all yes 
one would have to search far to find another as 
  search far repeated the count evidently sorry had 
not said more  search far he said turning back 
the of his coat to get at his snuffbox  
 other day when he came out from in full 
uniform michael did not finish for on the still air 
he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with 
only two or three giving tongue he bent down his 
head and listened shaking a finger at his  are 
on the of the he whispered  to the  
the count forgetting to out the smile on his face 
looked into the distance straight before him down the open 
space holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking 
any after the cry of the came the deep tones 
of the call from hunting the joined the first three 
and they could be heard in full cry with that 
peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are 
after a the no longer set on the but changed 
to the cry of and above the others rose voice 
now a deep bass now his voice seemed to the 
whole wood and carried far out into the open field 
 after listening a few moments in silence the count 
and his convinced themselves that the had into two the 
sound of the larger eagerly giving tongue began to die 
away in the distance the other rushed by the wood 
past the count and it was with this that voice 
was heard calling the sounds of both mingled and broke 
apart again but both were becoming more  and stooped 
to the a young had the count too and noticing 
the snuffbox in his hand opened it and took a 
pinch  cried to a that was pushing forward out 
of the wood the count started and dropped the snuffbox 
ivanovna to pick it up the count and were looking 
at him  then unexpectedly as often happens the sound 
of the hunt suddenly approached as if the in full 
cry and were just in front of them  the 
count turned and saw on his right staring at him 
with eyes starting out of his head raising his cap 
and pointing before him to the other side   
out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he 
had long to utter that word and letting the slip 
he toward the count  the count and out of 
the wood and saw on their left a which softly 
swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet 
farther to the left to the very place where they 
were standing the angry and getting free of the rushed 
past the horses feet at the  the paused turned 
its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly like a man 
suffering from the and still slightly swaying from side to 
side gave a of and with a of its tail 
into the of the wood at the same instant with 
a cry like a wail first one then another and 
then another from the wood opposite and the whole rushed 
across the field toward the very spot where the had 
the behind the and horse appeared dark with on its 
long back sat forward his gray hair hanging over his 
flushed face   he cried when he caught sight 
of the count his eyes flashed   you he 
shouted holding up his threateningly at the count   
let the go what and as if to say more 
to the frightened and count he the of his with 
all the anger the count had and off after the 
the count like a looked round trying by a smile 
to sympathy for his but was no longer there he 
was round by the while the field was coming up 
on both sides all trying to head the but it 
vanished into the wood before they could do so  
    chapter v   nicholas rostov 
meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the by the 
way the hunt approached and by the of the dogs 
whose notes were familiar to him by the way the 
voices of the approached and rose he realized what was 
at the he knew that young and old were there 
that the had into two that somewhere a was being 
and that something had gone wrong he expected the to 
come his way any moment he made thousands of different 
as to where and from what side the would come 
and how he would set upon it hope with despair 
several times he addressed a to god that the should 
come his way he with that passionate and feeling with 
which men at moments of great excitement from trivial causes 
 would it be to thee to do this for 
me he said to god  know art great and 
that it is a sin to ask this of thee 
but for god sake do let the old come my 
way and let spring at it sight of  who 
is watching from over there seize it by the in 
a death a thousand times during that half rostov eager 
and glances over the edge of the wood with the 
two rising above the and the with its water side 
and  cap just visible above the on his right 
  i have such luck thought rostov  what 
it be worth it is not to be everywhere at 
cards and in war i am always of and of 
dolokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind  once 
in my life to get an old i want only 
that thought he eyes and ears and looking to the 
left and then to the right and listening to the 
slightest variation of note in the of the dogs  
again he looked to the right and saw something running 
toward him across the deserted field  it can be 
thought rostov taking a deep as a man does at 
the coming of something long for the height of happiness 
was reached so simply without or noise or display that 
rostov could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt 
for over a second the ran forward and jumped heavily 
over a that lay in her path she was an 
old animal with a gray back and big she ran 
without evidently feeling sure that no one saw her rostov 
holding his looked round at the they stood or lay 
not seeing the or understanding the situation old had turned 
his head and was angrily searching for his teeth and 
at his legs   whispered rostov his lips the 
jumped up the rings of the and their ears finished 
his and his ears got up with quivering tail from 
which of hair down   i them or not 
nicholas asked himself as the approached him coming from the 
suddenly the whole changed she seeing what she had probably 
never seen before eyes fixed upon her turning her head 
a little toward rostov she paused   or forward 
eh no matter forward the seemed to say to herself 
and she moved forward without again looking round and with 
a quiet long easy yet resolute   cried nicholas 
in a voice not his own and of its own 
accord his good horse darted over to head off the 
and the passed it running still nicholas did not hear 
his own cry nor feel that he was nor see 
the nor the ground over which he went he saw 
only the who her speed on in the same direction 
along the hollow the first to come into was with 
her black and powerful gaining upon the nearer and nearer 
now she was of it but the turned its head 
to face her and instead of putting on speed as 
she usually did suddenly raised her tail and her  
 shouted nicholas  the rushed forward from behind impetuously 
at the and seized it by its but immediately jumped 
aside in the her teeth and again rose and forward 
followed at the distance of a of feet by all 
the who did not get any closer to her  
 get away no it impossible thought nicholas still shouting 
with a voice   he shouted looking round for 
the old who was now his only hope with all 
the strength age had left him himself to the and 
watching the heavily aside to it but the quickness of 
the and the made it plain that had nicholas could 
already see not far in front of him the wood 
where the would certainly escape should she reach it but 
coming toward him he saw and a almost straight at 
the there was still hope a long young one nicholas 
did not know from another rushed impetuously at the from 
in front and almost her over but the jumped up 
more quickly than anyone could have expected and her teeth 
at the which with a piercing fell with its head 
on the ground from a in its side   
old fellow nicholas  to the delay by this crossing 
of the path the old dog with its hair hanging 
from its was within five of it as if aware 
of her danger the turned her eyes on tucked her 
tail yet further between her legs and her speed but 
here nicholas only saw that something happened to was suddenly 
on the and they rolled together down into a just 
in front of them  that instant when nicholas saw 
the in the with the dogs while from under them 
could be seen her gray hair and and her frightened 
head with her ears laid back  was her by 
the was the moment of his life with his hand 
on his he was ready to and the when she 
suddenly thrust her head up from among that of dogs 
and then her were on the edge of the she 
her teeth  no longer had her by the with 
a movement of her legs out of the and having 
herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went 
forward his hair and probably or climbed with difficulty out 
of the   my god why nicholas cried in 
despair   was from the other side across the 
path and his once more stopped the animal she was 
again in  nicholas and his with  and his 
were all round the crying  shouting and preparing to 
each moment that the back and starting forward again every 
time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where 
she would be safe  already at the beginning of 
this hearing the had rushed out from the wood he 
saw seize the and checked his horse the affair to 
be over but when he saw that the did not 
and that the shook herself and ran for safety set 
his not at the but straight toward the wood just 
as had run to cut the animal off as a 
result of this he up to the just when she 
had been stopped a second time by   up 
silently holding a in his left hand and the sides 
of his horse with his as if it were a 
 nicholas neither saw nor heard until the breathing heavily 
past him and he heard the fall of a body 
and saw lying on the back among the dogs trying 
to seize her by the ears it was evident to 
the dogs the and to the herself that all was 
now over the terrified pressed back her ears and tried 
to rise but the stuck to her rose a little 
took a step and with his whole weight as if 
lying down to rest fell on the her by the 
ears nicholas was about to her but whispered  we 
her and changing his position set his foot on the 
neck a stick was thrust between her and she was 
with a as if her legs were together and rolled 
her over once or twice from side to side  
with happy exhausted faces they laid the old on a 
and horse and accompanied by the dogs at her took 
her to the place where they were all to meet 
the had killed two of the and the three the 
assembled with their and their stories and all came to 
look at the which with her broad head hanging down 
and the stick between her gazed with great eyes at 
this crowd of dogs and men her when she was 
touched she her legs and looked yet simply at everybody 
old count rostov also up and touched the   
what a one said he  one eh he asked 
who was standing near   your excellency answered quickly 
his cap  the count remembered the he had let 
slip and his with   but you are a 
fellow friend said the count  for sole reply gave 
him a shy childlike and amiable smile    
  chapter vi   the old count went 
home and natasha and petya promised to return very soon 
but as it was still early the hunt went farther 
at they put the into a with young nicholas standing 
in a field could see all his  facing him 
lay a field of winter there his own stood alone 
in a hollow behind a the had scarcely been before 
nicholas heard one he knew giving tongue at other joined 
in now and now again giving tongue a moment later 
he heard a cry from the that a had been 
found and the whole joining together rushed along the toward 
the and away from nicholas  he saw the in 
their red along the edge of the he even saw 
the and was expecting a to show itself at any 
moment on the opposite  the standing in the hollow 
moved and his and nicholas saw a queer short red 
with a fine going hard across the field the bore 
down on it now they drew close to the which 
began to between the field in and its when suddenly 
a strange white dashed in followed by a black one 
and everything was in the formed a star figure scarcely 
swaying their and with turned away from the center of 
the group two up to the dogs one in a 
red cap the other a stranger in a green coat 
  this thought nicholas  that from he is 
not  man  the got the but stayed there 
a long time without it to the their horses and 
with high stood near them and there too the dogs 
were lying the waved their arms and did something to 
the then from that spot came the sound of a 
with the signal agreed on in case of a fight 
  having a row with our said nicholas  
nicholas sent the man to call natasha and petya to 
him and at a to the place where the were 
getting the together several of the field to the spot 
where the fight was going on  nicholas and with 
natasha and petya who had up stopped near the waiting 
to see how the matter would end out of the 
came the who had been and toward his young with 
the tied to his while still at a distance he 
took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but 
he was pale and and his face was angry one 
of his eyes was black but he probably was not 
even aware of it   has happened asked nicholas 
  likely thing a our dogs had and it 
was my gray that caught it go to law indeed 
he at the i gave him one with the here 
it is on my do you want a taste of 
this said the pointing to his and probably himself still 
speaking to his foe  nicholas not stopping to talk 
to the man asked his sister and petya to wait 
for him and to the spot where the hunting party 
was  the victorious off to join the field and 
there by inquiring his  the were that with whom 
the rostovs had a and were at law over places 
that belonged by custom to the rostovs and had now 
as if sent his men to the very the rostovs 
were hunting and let his man a their dogs had 
 nicholas though he had never seen with his usual 
of in him from reports of his and violence and 
regarded him as his foe he in angry agitation toward 
him firmly his and fully prepared to take the most 
resolute and desperate steps to his  hardly had he 
passed an angle of the wood before a stout in 
a cap came toward him on a handsome horse accompanied 
by two hunt  instead of an nicholas found in 
a and who was particularly anxious to make the young 
count acquaintance having up to nicholas raised his cap and 
said he much what had occurred and would have the 
man who had allowed himself to seize a by someone 
else he to become better acquainted with the count and 
him to draw his  natasha afraid that her brother 
would do something dreadful had followed him in some excitement 
seeing the exchanging friendly greetings she up to them lifted 
his cap still higher to natasha and said with a 
pleasant smile that the young countess in her for the 
as well as in her beauty of which he had 
heard much  to his pressed the rostovs to come 
to an of his about a mile away which he 
usually kept for himself and which he said with nicholas 
agreed and the hunt now doubled moved on  the 
way to was across the the hunt fell into line 
the together  rostov and kept glancing at one another 
dogs trying not to be observed by their and searching 
uneasily for rivals to their own  rostov was particularly 
struck by the beauty of a small red on slender 
but with like a delicate and prominent black eyes he 
had heard of the of and in that beautiful saw 
a rival to his own  in the middle of 
a sober conversation by about the year nicholas pointed to 
the red   fine little that said he in 
a careless tone  she   one yes she 
a good dog gets what she after answered indifferently of 
the red for which a year before he had given 
a three families of house serfs  in your too 
the is nothing to of count he went on continuing 
the conversation they had and considering it polite to return 
the young count compliment looked at his and picked out 
who his attention by her  black one of yours 
is fine said he   she fast enough replied 
nicholas and thought  only a full would cross the 
field now i show you what sort of she is 
and turning to his he said he would give a 
to anyone who found a   don understand continued 
 some can be so about game and dogs for 
myself i can tell you count i enjoy in company 
such as this what could be better  again raised 
his cap to natasha  as for counting and what 
one takes i don care about that   course 
not   being upset because someone else and not 
mine something all i care about is to enjoy seeing 
the is it not so count for i consider that 
  came the long cry of one of the 
who had he stood on a in the holding his 
and again repeated his long cry   call and 
the meant that he saw a sitting   he 
has found one i think said  we must ride 
up shall we both course it answered nicholas seeing in 
and  red two rivals he had never yet had 
a of against his own  suppose they my at 
once he thought as he with  and toward the 
  full one asked as he approached the who 
had the not without agitation he looked round and to 
  you michael he said addressing   the 
latter was with a sullen expression on his face  
 can i join in why you given a village 
for each of your that it come on yours are 
worth thousands try yours against one another you two and 
i look on   hey hey he shouted  
he added by this expressing his affection and the he 
placed on this red natasha saw and felt the agitation 
the two elderly men and her brother were trying to 
and was herself by it  the stood halfway up 
the holding up his and the up to him at 
a the that were far off on the turned away 
from the and the but not the also moved away 
all were moving slowly and   is it pointing 
asked nicholas a hundred toward the who had the  
but before the could reply the the coming next morning 
was unable to rest and up the on rushed in 
full cry after the and from all sides the that 
were not on darted after the and the all the 
hunt who had been moving slowly shouted  calling in 
the while the with a cry of  across the 
field setting the on the the nicholas natasha and  
reckless of where and how they went seeing only the 
and the and fearing only to lose sight even for 
an instant of the the they had started was a 
strong and one when he jumped up he did not 
run at once but his ears listening to the shouting 
and that from all sides at once he took a 
bounds not very quickly letting the gain on him and 
finally having his direction and realized his danger laid back 
his ears and rushed off he had been lying in 
the but in front of him was the where the 
ground was soft the two of the who had him 
having been the were the first to see and him 
but they had not gone far before red passed them 
got within a length at the with terrible aiming at 
his and thinking she had seized him rolled over like 
a ball the his back and off yet more swiftly 
from behind rushed the broad black and began rapidly gaining 
on the   dear rose nicholas cry it looked 
as if would immediately on the but she overtook him 
and past the had again the beautiful reached him but 
when close to the paused as if the distance so 
as not to make a mistake this time but seize 
his   darling in a voice unlike his own 
did not to his appeal at the very moment when 
she would have seized her the moved and darted along 
the between the winter and the again and were running 
like a pair of carriage horses and began to the 
but it was for the to run on the and 
the did not him so quickly   that it 
come on came a third voice just then and  
red and its back caught up with the two pushed 
of them of the terrible strain put on speed close 
to the it off the onto the again put on 
speed still more to his knees in the field and 
all one could see was how his back he rolled 
over with the a ring of him a moment later 
everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs only 
the delighted  and cut off a shaking the for 
the blood to off and anxiously glancing round with eyes 
while his arms and legs he spoke without himself knowing 
whom to or what about  it come on that 
a dog there it has them all the thousand as 
well as the one that it come on said he 
and looking around as if he were someone as if 
they were all his and had him and only now 
had he at last succeeded in himself  are your 
thousand ones that it come on   here a 
for you he said down the  deserved it that 
it come on   tired herself out she run 
it down three times by herself said nicholas also not 
listening to anyone and of whether he were heard or 
not   what is there in running across it 
like that said   she had it and turned 
it away any could take it was saying at the 
same time from his and his excitement at the same 
moment natasha without drawing screamed joyously and so that it 
set everyone by that she expressed what the others expressed 
by all talking at once and it was so strange 
that she must herself have been ashamed of so wild 
a cry and everyone else would have been at it 
at any other time  himself up the threw it 
neatly and across his horse back as if by that 
gesture he meant to rebuke everybody and with an air 
of not wishing to speak to anyone his and off 
the others all followed dispirited and and only much later 
were they able to their former affectation of indifference for 
a long time they continued to look at red who 
his back with and the ring of his walked along 
just behind  horse with the serene air of a 
  i am like any other dog as long 
as it not a question of but when it is 
then look out his appearance seemed to nicholas to be 
saying  when much later  up to nicholas and 
began talking to him he felt flattered that after what 
had happened  deigned to speak to him   
   chapter vii   toward evening took 
leave of nicholas who found that they were so far 
from home that he  that the hunting party should 
spend the night in his little village of mikhaylovna  
 if you put up at my house that will 
be better still that it come on said   
see it weather and you could rest and the little 
countess could be driven home in a trap   
was a was sent to for a trap while nicholas 
with natasha and petya to  house  some five 
male serfs big and little rushed out to the front 
porch to meet their a score of women serfs old 
and young as well as children out from the back 
entrance to have a look at the who were the 
presence of natasha woman a lady and on the curiosity 
of the serfs to such a degree that many of 
them came up to her stared her in the face 
and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as 
though she were some on show and not a human 
being able to hear or understand what was said about 
her   look she sideways there she and her 
see she got a little hunting   gracious see 
her   she a   is it you 
didn go head over heels asked the of all addressing 
natasha   at the porch of his little house 
which stood in the midst of an garden and after 
a glance at his shouted that the ones should take 
themselves off and that all necessary should be made to 
receive the guests and the visitors  the serfs all 
dispersed  lifted natasha off her horse and taking her 
hand led her up the steps of the porch the 
house with its bare was not did not seem that 
those living in it at keeping it neither was it 
in the there was a smell of fresh and and 
about   led the visitors through the anteroom into 
a small hall with a table and red chairs then 
into the drawing room with a round table and a 
sofa and finally into his private room where there was 
a tattered sofa a worn and of suvorov of the 
host father and mother and of himself in military uniform 
the study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs  asked 
his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home 
and then went out of the room his back still 
came into the room and lay down on the sofa 
himself with his tongue and teeth leading from the study 
was a passage in which a with could be seen 
from behind this came women laughter and natasha nicholas and 
petya took off their and sat down on the sofa 
petya on his elbow fell at once natasha and nicholas 
were silent their faces they were and very cheerful they 
looked at one another  that the hunt was over 
and they were in the house nicholas no longer considered 
it necessary to show his superiority over his sister natasha 
gave him a and neither refrained long from into a 
of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready 
to account for it  after a while  came 
in in a cossack coat blue and small top and 
natasha felt that this the very one she had regarded 
with surprise and at was just the right thing and 
not at all worse than a swallow or frock coat 
 too was in high and far from being offended 
by the brother and sister laughter  could never enter 
his head that they might be laughing at his way 
of life he himself joined in the   right 
young countess that it come on i never saw anyone 
like her said he nicholas a pipe with a long 
and with a motion of three fingers taking down another 
that had been cut short  all day like a 
man and is as fresh as ever  soon after 
 the door was opened evidently from the sound by 
a girl and a stout rosy good woman of about 
forty with a and full red lips entered carrying a 
large with dignity and in her glance and in every 
motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasant 
smile bowed respectfully in spite of her exceptional which her 
to her chest and and throw back her head this 
woman  was  very lightly she went to the 
table set down the and with her plump white hands 
took from it the bottles and hors d and dishes 
and arranged them on the table when she had finished 
she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a 
smile on her face  i am i am she 
now do you understand  her expression said to rostov 
how could one help understanding not only nicholas but even 
natasha understood the meaning of his puckered and the happy 
complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when fedorovna entered 
on the was a bottle of wine different kinds of 
made with in the still and sparkling  and and 
sweets afterwards she brought a made with and made with 
 all this was the fruit of fedorovna gathered and 
prepared by her the smell and taste of it all 
had a of fedorovna herself a of and pleasant smiles 
  this little lady she kept saying as she 
offered natasha first one thing and then another  natasha 
ate of everything and thought she had never seen or 
such such such sweets or such a anywhere fedorovna left 
the room  after supper over their rostov and  
talked of past and future of and dogs while natasha 
sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes 
she tried several times to petya that he might eat 
something but he only muttered words without waking up natasha 
felt so and happy in these that she only feared 
the trap would come for her too soon after a 
pause such as often when receiving friends for the first 
time in one own house  answering a thought that 
was in his visitors mind said   you see 
is how i am finishing my days death will come 
that it come on nothing will remain then why anyone 
  face was very significant and even handsome as 
he said this rostov recalled all the good he had 
heard about him from his father and the neighbors the 
whole  had the reputation of being the most honorable 
and of they called him in to decide family chose 
him as secrets to him him to be a and 
to other but he always refused public passing the and 
spring in the on his sitting at home in winter 
and lying in his garden in summer   don

gave it up i am not fit for it that 
it come on i can make head or tail of 
it that for you haven enough now hunting is another 
matter it come on open the door there he shouted 
 have you it  the door at the end 
of the passage led to the room as they called 
the room for the hunt  there was a of 
bare feet and an unseen hand opened the door into 
the room from which came the clear sounds of a 
on which someone who was evidently a of the art 
was playing natasha had been listening to those strains for 
some time and now went out into the passage to 
hear better   my i have got him a 
good i fond of it said   it was 
the custom for to play the in the room when 
 returned from the  was fond of such music 
  good really very good said nicholas with some 
as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him 
very much   good said natasha noticing her brother 
tone   good it simply  just as  
and had seemed to her the best in the world 
so also that song at that moment seemed to her 
the of musical   please more cried natasha at 
the door as soon as the ceased up and the 
to the air of my lady with and variations  
sat listening slightly smiling with his head on one side 
the air was repeated a hundred times the was several 
times and the same notes were again but the did 
not grow weary of it and wished to hear it 
again and again fedorovna came in and leaned her portly 
person against the   like listening she said to 
natasha with a smile like   a good of 
ours she added   doesn play that part right 
said  suddenly with an gesture  he ought to 
burst out it come on to burst out   
you play then asked natasha   did not answer 
but smiled   go and see if the of 
my are all right i haven touched it for a 
long time that it on i given it up  
fedorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her 
and brought back the  without looking at anyone  
the dust off it and the case with his bony 
fingers the and settled himself in his armchair he took 
the a little above the his left elbow with a 
gesture and with a at fedorovna struck a single and 
and then quietly smoothly and began playing in very time 
not my lady but the well song came a down 
the street the played with precision and in time began 
to in the hearts of nicholas and natasha in them 
the same kind of sober mirth as from fedorovna whole 
being fedorovna flushed and drawing her over her face went 
laughing out of the room  continued to play carefully 
with looking with a changed and inspired expression at the 
spot where fedorovna had just stood something seemed to be 
laughing a little on one side of his face under 
his gray especially as the song grew and the time 
and when here and there as he ran his fingers 
over the something seemed to   lovely go on 
uncle go on shouted natasha as soon as he had 
finished she jumped up and hugged and kissed him  
nicholas she said turning to her brother as if asking 
him  is it me so  nicholas too was 
greatly pleased by  playing and  played the piece 
over again fedorovna smiling face in the doorway and behind 
hers other faces      water clear 
and sweet     stop dear i entreat 
 played  once more running his fingers over the 
and then he stopped short and his shoulders   
on uncle dear natasha in an tone as if her 
life on it   rose and it was as 
if there were two men in him one of them 
smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow 
struck a naive and attitude to a dance   
then niece he exclaimed to natasha the hand that had 
just struck a  natasha threw off the shawl from 
her shoulders ran forward to face  and setting her 
arms also made a motion with her shoulders and struck 
an attitude  where how and when had this young 
countess educated by an french governess from the russian air 
she that spirit and obtained that manner which the de 
 would one would have long ago have but the 
spirit and the movements were those and russian ones that 
 had expected of her as soon as she had 
struck her and smiled and with sly the fear that 
had at first seized nicholas and the others that she 
might not do the right thing was at an end 
and they were already admiring her     
   the french shawl dance   she 
did the right thing with such precision such complete precision 
that fedorovna who had at once her the handkerchief she 
for the dance had tears in her eyes though she 
laughed as she watched this graceful countess in and and 
so different from herself who yet was able to understand 
all that was in and in father and mother and 
aunt and in every russian man and woman   
little countess that it on cried  with a joyous 
laugh having finished the dance  done niece now a 
fine young fellow must be found as husband for you 
that it on   already said nicholas smiling  
 said  in surprise looking inquiringly at natasha who 
nodded her head with a happy smile   such 
a one she said but as soon as she had 
said it a new train of thoughts and in her 
 did nicholas smile mean when he said  already 
is he glad of it or not it is as 
if he thought my bolkonski would not of or understand 
our gaiety but he would understand it all where is 
he now she thought and her face suddenly became serious 
but this only a second  to think about it 
she said to herself and sat down again smilingly beside 
 begging him to play something more   played 
another song and a then after a pause he his 
and sang his favorite hunting song     
 as  growing dark last night    
 fell the snow so soft and light   
 sang as sing with full and naive conviction that 
the whole meaning of a song lies in the words 
and that the comes of itself and that apart from 
the words there is no which only to give measure 
to the words as a result of this the like 
the song of a was good natasha was in over 
 she to give up learning the harp and to 
play only the she asked  for his and at 
once found the of the song  after nine o 
two and three men who had been sent to look 
for them arrived to natasha and petya the count and 
countess did not know where they were and were very 
anxious said one of the men  petya was carried 
out like a and laid in the larger of the 
two natasha and nicholas got into the other  wrapped 
natasha up warmly and took leave of her with quite 
a new tenderness he accompanied them on foot as far 
as the bridge that could not be so that they 
had to go round by the and he sent to 
ride in front with   dear niece his voice 
called out of the the voice natasha had known but 
the one that had as  growing dark last night 
 in the village through which they passed there were 
red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke   
a darling uncle is said natasha when they had come 
out onto the   returned nicholas  not cold 
  i quite quite all right i feel so 
comfortable answered natasha almost perplexed by her they remained silent 
a long while the night was dark and they could 
not see the horses but only heard them through the 
unseen  what was passing in that childlike soul that 
so eagerly caught and all the of life how did 
they all find place in her but she was very 
happy as they were home she suddenly struck up the 
air of as  growing dark last night of which 
she had all the way been trying to get and 
had at last caught   it said nicholas  
 were you thinking about just now nicholas inquired natasha 
 they were fond of asking one another that question 
  said nicholas trying to remember  you see 
first i thought that the red was like uncle and 
that if he were a man he would always keep 
uncle near him if not for his then for his 
manner what a good fellow uncle is don you think 
so well and you   wait a bit wait 
yes first i thought that we are along and that 
we are going home but that heaven knows where we 
are really going in the and that we shall arrive 
and suddenly find that we are not in but in 
and then i thought no nothing else   know 
i expect you thought of him said nicholas smiling as 
natasha knew by the sound of his voice   
said natasha though she had in been thinking about prince 
andrew at the same time as of the rest and 
of how he would have liked   then i 
was saying to myself all the way  well carried 
herself how well and nicholas heard her happy ringing laughter 
 do you know she suddenly said  know that 
i shall never again be as happy and as i 
am now   nonsense exclaimed nicholas and he thought 
 charming this natasha of mine is i have no 
other friend like her and never shall have why should 
she marry we might always drive about together   
a darling this nicholas of mine is thought natasha  
 there are still lights in the drawing she said 
pointing to the of the house that in the of 
the night      chapter viii  
 count ilya rostov had the position of of the 
because it him in too much but still his affairs 
did not natasha and nicholas often noticed their parents together 
anxiously and privately and heard of the fine rostov house 
and near moscow it was not necessary to entertain so 
as when the count had been and life at was 
than in former years but still the enormous house and 
its were full of people and more than twenty sat 
down to table every day these were all their own 
people who had settled down in the house almost as 
members of the family or persons who were it seemed 
to live in the count house such were the and 
his wife the dancing and his family an old lady 
an of the house and many others such as petya 
tutors the girls former governess and other people who simply 
found it and more advantageous to live in the count 
house than at home they had not as many visitors 
as before but the old of life without which the 
count and countess could not of remained there was still 
the hunting which nicholas had even the same fifty horses 
and fifteen in the the same and dinner parties to 
the whole on name days there were still the count 
games of and boston at which out his cards so 
that everybody could see them let himself be of of 
rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an 
opportunity to play a with count rostov as a most 
of income  the count moved in his affairs as 
in a huge trying not to believe that he was 
but becoming more and more so at every step and 
feeling too to break the or to set to work 
carefully and to them the countess with her heart felt 
that her children were being that it was not the 
count for he could not help being what he was 
 he tried to hide it he himself from the 
consciousness of his own and his children and she tried 
to find means of the position from her feminine point 
of she could see only one for nicholas to marry 
a rich she felt this to be their last hope 
and that if nicholas refused the match she had found 
for him she would have to the hope of ever 
getting matters right this match was with julie karagina the 
daughter of excellent and virtuous parents a girl the rostovs 
had known from childhood and who had now become a 
wealthy through the death of the last of her  
the countess had written direct to julie mother in moscow 
suggesting a between their children and had received a answer 
from her karagina had replied that for her part she 
was agreeable and everything on her daughter she nicholas to 
come to moscow  several times the countess with tears 
in her eyes told her son that now both her 
daughters were settled her only wish was to see him 
married she said she could lie down in her grave 
if that were accomplished then she told him that she 
knew of a splendid girl and tried to what he 
thought about  at other times she julie to him 
and him to go to moscow during the to himself 
nicholas guessed what his mother remarks were leading to and 
during one of these conversations her to speak quite she 
told him that her only hope of getting their affairs 
now lay in his marrying julie karagina   mamma 
suppose i loved a girl who has no fortune would 
you expect me to sacrifice my and my honor for 
the sake of money he asked his mother not the 
of his question and only wishing to show his noble 
  you have not understood me said his mother 
not knowing how to justify herself  have not understood 
me it is your happiness i wish for she added 
feeling that she was telling an and was becoming she 
began to cry   don cry only tell me 
that you wish it and you know i will give 
my life anything to put you at ease said nicholas 
 would sacrifice anything for you my  but the 
countess did not want the question put like that she 
did not want a sacrifice from her son she herself 
wished to make a sacrifice for him   you 
have not understood me don let us talk about it 
she replied wiping away her tears   i do 
love a poor girl said nicholas to himself  i 
to sacrifice my and my honor for money i wonder 
how mamma could speak so to me because sonya is 
poor i must not love her he thought  not 
to her faithful devoted love yet i should certainly be 
happier with her than with some doll julie i can 
always sacrifice my for my family welfare he said to 
himself  i can my if i love sonya that 
feeling is for me and higher than all else  
nicholas did not go to moscow and the countess did 
not the conversation with him about she saw with sorrow 
and sometimes with of a growing between her son and 
the sonya though she herself for it she could not 
refrain from at and sonya often pulling her up without 
reason addressing her as  dear and using the  
instead of the intimate  in speaking to her the 
kindhearted countess was the more vexed with sonya because that 
poor dark niece of hers was so so kind so 
grateful to her and so and in love with nicholas 
that there were no for finding with her  nicholas 
was spending the last of his leave at home a 
fourth letter had come from prince andrew from in which 
he wrote that he would have been on his way 
back to russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly 
in the warm climate which him to his return till 
the beginning of the new year natasha was still as 
much in love with her found the same in that 
love and was still as ready to throw herself into 
all the of life as before but at the end 
of the fourth month of their she began to have 
fits of which she could not she felt sorry for 
herself sorry that she was being wasted all this time 
and of no use to anyone she felt herself so 
capable of and being loved  things were not cheerful 
in the rostovs home      chapter 
ix   came and except for the the solemn 
and wearisome from neighbors and and the new dresses everyone 
put on there were no special festivities though the calm 
of twenty the by day and the of the winter 
seemed to call for some special of the  on 
the third day of week after the dinner all the 
of the house dispersed to rooms it was the time 
of the day nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors 
that morning was on the sitting sofa the old count 
was resting in his study sonya sat in the drawing 
room at the round table copying a design for embroidery 
the countess was playing patience ivanovna the sat with a 
sad face at the window with two old ladies natasha 
came into the room went up to sonya glanced at 
what she was doing and then went up to her 
mother and stood without speaking   are you about 
like an asked her mother  do you want  
 i want him now this minute i want him 
said natasha with eyes and no sign of a smile 
 the countess lifted her head and looked attentively at 
her daughter   look at me mamma don look 
i shall cry   down with me a little 
said the countess   i want him why should 
i be wasted like this mamma  her voice broke 
tears from her eyes and she turned quickly to hide 
them and left the room  she passed into the 
sitting room stood there thinking and then went into the 
maids room there an old was at a young girl 
who stood having just run in through the cold from 
the serfs   playing a time for everything said 
the old woman   her alone said natasha

butler pantry she told them to set a samovar though 
it was not at all the time for tea  
the butler was the most ill person in the house 
natasha liked to test her power over him he the 
order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted  
 dear what a young lady said to frown at 
natasha  no one in the house sent people about 
or gave them as much trouble as natasha did she 
could not see people but had to send them on 
some she seemed to be trying whether any of them 
would get angry or with her but the serfs no 
one orders so as they did hers  can i

slowly along the passage   ivanovna what sort of 
children shall i have she asked the who was coming 
toward her in a woman jacket   answered the 
  o it always the same oh where am

and with her heels she ran quickly upstairs to see 
and his wife who lived on the upper story  
two governesses were sitting with the at a table on 
which were of and the governesses were discussing whether it 
was to live in moscow or natasha sat down listened 
to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and 
then got up again   island of she said 
 she repeated each syllable distinctly and not to madame 
who asked her what she was saying she went out 
of the room  her brother petya was upstairs too 
with the man in on him he was preparing fireworks 
to let off that night   petya she called 
to him  me downstairs  petya ran up and 
offered her his back she jumped on it putting her 
arms round his neck and he along with her  
 don the island of she said and off his 
back she went downstairs  having as it were her 
her power and made sure that everyone was but that 
all the same it was dull natasha herself to the 
ballroom picked up her sat down in a dark corner 
behind a and began to run her fingers over the 
in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from 
an she had heard in petersburg with prince andrew what 
she drew from the would have had no meaning for 
other but in her a whole of from those sounds 
she sat behind the with her eyes fixed on a 
of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to 
herself and pondered she was in a mood for on 
the past  sonya passed to the pantry with a 
glass in her hand natasha glanced at her and at 
the in the pantry door and it seemed to her 
that she remembered the light falling through that once before 
and sonya passing with a glass in her hand  
it was exactly the same thought natasha   what 
is this she cried a thick string   you 
are there said sonya with a start and came near 
and listened  don know a she timidly afraid of 
being wrong   that just how she started and 
just how she came up smiling timidly when all this 
happened before thought natasha  in just the same way 
i thought there was something in her   it 
the from the water listen and natasha sang the air 
of the so that sonya should catch it  were 
you going she asked   change the water in 
this glass i am just finishing the design   
always find something to do but i can said natasha 
 where nicholas   i think   go 
and him said natasha  him i want him to 
come and sing  she sat wondering what the meaning 
of it all having happened before could be and without 
this problem or at all not having done so she 
again passed in fancy to the time when she was 
with him and he was looking at her with a 
eyes   if only he would come i am 
so afraid it will never be and of all i 
am growing old the thing there won then be in 
me what there is now but perhaps he come today 
will come immediately perhaps he has come and is sitting 
in the drawing room perhaps he came yesterday and i 
have forgotten it she rose put down the and went 
to the drawing room  all the circle tutors governesses 
and guests were already at the tea table the stood 
round the table prince andrew was not there and life 
was going on as before   here she is 
said the old count when he saw natasha enter  
sit down by me but natasha stayed by her mother 
and glanced round as if looking for something   
she muttered  him to me give him mamma quickly 
quickly and she again had difficulty in her  she 
sat down at the table and listened to the conversation 
between the elders and nicholas who had also come to 
the table  god my god the same faces the 
same talk papa holding his cup and in the same 
way thought natasha feeling with horror a sense of rising 
up in her for the whole household because they were 
always the same  after tea nicholas sonya and natasha 
went to the sitting room to their favorite corner where 
their most intimate always began      
chapter x    it ever happen to you 
said natasha to her brother when they settled down in 
the sitting room  it ever happen to you to 
feel as if there were nothing more to come that 
everything good is past and to feel not exactly dull 
but sad   should think so he replied  
have felt like that when everything was all right and 
everyone was cheerful the thought has come into my mind 
that i was already tired of it all and that 
we must all die once in the regiment i had 
not gone to some where there was music and suddenly 
i felt so depressed   yes i know i 
know i know natasha interrupted him  i was quite 
little that used to be so with me do you 
remember when i was once about some you were all 
dancing and i sat sobbing in the i shall never 
forget it i felt sad and sorry for everyone for 
myself and for everyone and i was innocent was the 
chief thing said natasha  you remember   remember 
answered nicholas  remember that i came to you afterwards 
and wanted to you but do you know i felt 
ashamed to we were absurd i had a funny doll 
then and wanted to give it to you do you 
remember   do you remember natasha asked with a 
smile  once long long ago when we were quite 
little uncle called us into the study was in the 
old house it was dark went in and suddenly there 
stood   chimed in nicholas with a smile of 
 course i remember even now i don know whether 
there really was a or if we only it or 
were told about him   was gray you remember 
and had white teeth and stood and looked at us 
  do you remember asked nicholas   yes 
i do remember something too sonya answered timidly   
know i have asked papa and mamma about that said 
natasha  they say there was no at all but 
you see you remember   course i do i 
remember his teeth as if i had just seen them 
  strange it is it as if it were 
a i like that   do you remember how 
we rolled hard eggs in the ballroom and suddenly two 
old women began spinning round on the was that real 
or not do you remember what fun it was  
 and you remember how papa in his blue a 
in the porch  so they went through their smiling 
with pleasure not the sad of old age but youthful 
ones of one most past in which and they laughed 
with quiet enjoyment  sonya as always did not quite 
keep with them though they the same  much that 
they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she 
recalled did not the same feeling as they experienced she 
simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with 
it  she only really took part when they recalled 
sonya first arrival she told them how afraid she had 
been of nicholas because he had on a jacket and 
her nurse had told her that she too would be 
up with   i remember their telling me that 
you had been born under a said natasha  i 
remember that i dared not it then but knew that 
it was not true and i felt so uncomfortable  
while they were talking a maid thrust her head in 
at the other door of the sitting room   
have brought the miss she said in a whisper  
 isn wanted petya tell them to take it away 
replied natasha  in the middle of their talk in 
the sitting room came in and went up to the 
harp that stood there in a corner he took off 
its and the harp gave out a sound   
please play my favorite by field came the old countess 
voice from the drawing room  struck a and turning 
to natasha nicholas and sonya remarked  quiet you young 
people are   we said natasha glancing round for 
a moment and then continuing the conversation they were now 
discussing  began to play natasha went on to the 
table took up a carried it out and returned herself 
quietly in her former place it was dark in the 
room especially where they were sitting on the sofa but 
through the big the light of the full moon fell 
on the floor had finished the piece but still sat 
softly running his fingers over the evidently uncertain whether to 
stop or to play something else   you know 
said natasha in a whisper moving closer to nicholas and 
sonya  when one goes on and on one at 
last to remember what happened before one was in the 
world   is said sonya who had always learned 
well and remembered everything  believed that our have lived 
in and will go back into again   i 
don believe we ever were in said natasha still in 
a whisper though the music had ceased  i am 
certain that we were somewhere there and have been here 
and that is why we remember   i join 
you said who had come up quietly and he sat 
down by them   we have been why have 
we lower said nicholas  that can be   
lower who said we were lower how do i know 
what i was before natasha rejoined with conviction  soul 
is then if i shall always live i must have 
lived before lived for a whole   but it 
is hard for us to imagine remarked who had joined 
the young with a condescending smile but now spoke as 
quietly and seriously as they   is it hard 
to imagine said natasha  is now today and it 
will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and 
the day before   now it your turn sing 
me something they heard the countess say  are you 
sitting there like   i don at all want 
to replied natasha but all the same she rose  
none of them not even the middle wanted to break 
off their conversation and that corner in the sitting room 
but natasha got up and nicholas sat down at the 
clavichord standing as usual in the middle of the hall 
and choosing the place where the was best natasha began 
to sing her mother favorite song  she had said 
she did not want to sing but it was long 
since she had and long before she again sang as 
she did that evening the count from his study where 
he was talking to heard her and like a in 
a to run out to play in his talk while 
giving orders to the and at last stopped while stood 
in front of him also listening and smiling nicholas did 
not take his eyes off his sister and drew in 
time with her sonya as she listened thought of the 
immense difference there was between herself and her friend and 
how impossible it was for her to be anything like 
as as her cousin the old countess sat with a 
yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally 
shaking her head she thought of natasha and of her 
own youth and of how there was something unnatural and 
dreadful in this of natasha and prince andrew  who 
had seated himself beside the countess listened with closed eyes 
  countess he said at last  a talent 
she has nothing to learn softness tenderness and strength  
 how afraid i am for her how afraid i 
am said the countess not to whom she was speaking 
her told her that natasha had too much of something 
and that because of this she would not be happy 
before natasha had finished fourteen petya rushed in to say 
that some had arrived  natasha stopped   she 
screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw 
herself on it sobbing so that she could not stop 
for a long time   nothing mamma really it 
nothing only petya startled me she said trying to smile 
but her tears still and still her  the  
of the house serfs dressed up as and ladies and 
funny in with them the cold from outside and a 
feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly into the anteroom 
then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom 
where at first and then more and more merrily and 
they started dancing and playing games the countess when she 
had them and laughed at their went into the drawing 
room the count sat in the ballroom smiling radiantly and 
the the young people had  half an hour later 
there appeared among the other in the ballroom an old 
lady in a was nicholas a turkish girl was petya 
a was an hussar was natasha and a was sonya 
with burnt mustache and eyebrows  after the condescending surprise 
and praise from those who were not themselves dressed up 
the young people decided that their were so good that 
they ought to be shown  nicholas who as the 
were in splendid condition wanted to take them all for 
a drive in his to take with them about a 
of the and drive to    why disturb 
the old fellow said the countess  you have room 
to turn round there if you must go go to 
the  was a widow who with her family and 
their tutors and governesses lived three from the rostovs  
 right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly 
 dress up at once and go with them i 
make open her eyes  but the countess would not 
agree to his going he had had a bad all 
these last days it was decided that the count must 
not go but that if ivanovna  would go with 
them the young ladies might go to the sonya generally 
so timid and shy more than anyone begging ivanovna not 
to refuse  sonya was the best of all her 
mustache and eyebrows were becoming everyone told her she looked 
very handsome and she was in a and mood with 
her some inner voice told her that now or never 
her fate would be decided and in her male she 
seemed quite a different person ivanovna to go and in 
half an hour four with large and small their and 
over the snow drove up to the porch  natasha 
was in setting a merry tone which passing from one 
to another grew and reached its when they all came 
out into the and got into the talking calling to 
one another laughing and shouting  two of the were 
the usual household the third was the old count with 
a from the orlov as horse the fourth was nicholas 
own with a short black horse nicholas in his old 
lady dress over which he had his hussar stood in 
the middle of the in hand  it was so 
light that he could see the reflected from the metal 
and from the eyes of the horses who looked round 
in alarm at the party under the of the porch 
 natasha sonya madame and two maids got into nicholas 
his wife and petya into the old count and the 
rest of the seated themselves in the other two  
 go shouted nicholas to his father wishing for a 
to race past him  the old count with and 
his party started forward on its as though to the 
snow its deep bell the side horses pressing against the 
of the middle horse in the snow which was dry 
and like and threw it up  nicholas set off 
following the first behind him the others moved their at 
first they drove at a steady along the road while 
they drove past the garden the of the bare often 
fell across the road and hid the brilliant but as 
soon as they were past the the plain in and 
spread out before them like diamonds and with went the 
first over a hole in the snow of the road 
and each of the other in the same way and 
breaking the the began to speed along the road one 
after the other   a lot of rang out 
natasha voice through the air   light it is 
nicholas came sonya voice  nicholas glanced round at sonya 
and bent down to see her face closer quite a 
new sweet face with black eyebrows and up at him 
from her close and yet so the   used 
to be sonya thought he and looked at her closer 
and smiled   is it nicholas   said 
he and turned again to the horses  when they 
came out onto the by and cut up by rough 
the of which were visible in the horses began to 
at the of their own accord and their the near 
side horse his head and breaking into a short tugged 
at his the horse swayed from side to side moving 
his ears as if asking  it time to begin 
now in front already far the deep bell of the 
ringing farther and farther off the black horses driven by 
could be clearly seen against the white snow from that 
one could hear the shouts laughter and voices of the 
  up my shouted nicholas pulling the to one 
side and the  it was only by the wind 
that met them and the given by the side horses 
who pulled their one noticed how fast the was flying 
nicholas looked back with and of that even the horses 
to other followed the horse swung steadily beneath the bow 
over its head with no thought of and ready to 
put on speed when  nicholas overtook the first they 
were and coming out upon a broad trodden across a 
near a river   are we thought he  
the i suppose but no is something new i never 
seen before this isn the nor the hill and heaven 
only knows what it is it is something new and 
enchanted well it may be and shouting to his horses 
he began to pass the first  held back his 
horses and turned his face which was already covered with 
to his eyebrows  nicholas gave the horses the and 
out his arms his tongue and let his horses go 
  look out he cried  still the two 
side by side and moved the feet of the side 
horses nicholas began to draw while still keeping his arms 
raised one hand with the   you won he 
shouted  nicholas put all his horses to a and 
passed the horses the fine dry snow on the faces 
of those in the them sounded quick ringing and they 
caught confused of swiftly moving legs and the of the 
they were passing the sound of the on the snow 
and the voices of girls were heard from different sides 
 again his horses nicholas looked around him they were 
still by the plain in and with stars   
is shouting that i should turn to the left but 
why to the left thought nicholas  we getting to 
the is this heaven only knows where we are going 
and heaven knows what is to us it is very 
strange and pleasant it is and he looked round in 
the   his mustache and are all white said 
one of the strange pretty people one with fine eyebrows 
and mustache   think this used to be natasha 
thought nicholas  that was madame but perhaps it not 
and this with the mustache i don know but i 
love her   you cold he asked  they 
did not answer but began to laugh from the behind 
shouted something something funny they could not make out what 
he said   yes some voices answered laughing  
 here was a forest with black moving and a 
of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the 
silver of and the of some and if this is 
really it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows 
where and have come to thought nicholas  it really 
was and maids and footmen with merry faces came running 
out to the porch carrying candles   is it 
asked someone in the porch   from the count 
i know by the horses replied some voices   
   chapter xi   a built woman 
wearing spectacles sat in the drawing room in a dress 
by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from 
feeling dull they were quietly dropping into snow and looking 
at the the would throw on the wall when they 
heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the 
 hussars ladies and after their and wiping the from 
their faces in the came into the ballroom where candles 
were hurriedly lighted the the lady a dance by the 
children the their faces and their voices bowed to their 
hostess and arranged themselves about the room   me 
there no them and natasha see whom she looks like 
she really me of somebody but he good i didn 
know him and how he dear me there a really 
how becoming it is to dear sonya and who is 
that well you have us up and away the tables 
and we were sitting so quietly the hussar the hussar 
just like a boy and the legs i can look 
at him different voices were saying  natasha the young 
favorite with them into the back rooms where a and 
and male were called for and received from the footman 
by bare girlish arms from behind the door ten minutes 
later all the young joined the  having given orders 
to clear the rooms for the visitors and arranged about 
for the and the serfs went about among the without 
her spectacles into their faces with a suppressed smile and 
to recognize any of them it was not merely and 
the rostovs she failed to recognize she did not even 
recognize her own daughters or her late husband and which 
they had put on   who is this she 
asked her governess into the face of her own daughter 
dressed up as a  suppose it is one of 
the rostovs well hussar and what regiment do you serve 
in she asked natasha  hand some fruit to the 
she ordered the butler who was things round  not 
by his law  sometimes as she looked at the 
strange but amusing cut by the who decided once for 
all that being no one would recognize them not at 
all shy hid her face in her handkerchief and her 
whole stout body shook with kindly elderly laughter   
little look at she said  after russian country and 
made the serfs and join in one large circle a 
ring a string and a silver were and they all 
played games together  in an hour all the were 
and the eyebrows and were over the flushed and merry 
faces began to recognize the their and particularly how they 
the young ladies and she thanked them all for having 
her so well the visitors were to supper in the 
drawing room and the serfs had something served to them 
in the ballroom   to tell one fortune in 
the empty is said an old maid who lived with 
the during supper   said the eldest girl  
 go it takes courage   go said sonya 
  what happened to the young lady said the 
second girl   began the old maid  young 
lady once went out took a laid the table for 
two all properly and sat down after sitting a while 
she suddenly someone coming a up with she him coming 
he comes in just in the shape of a man 
like an officer in and down to table with her 
  ah screamed natasha rolling her eyes with horror 
  and how did he speak   like 
a man everything quite all right and he began her 
and she should have kept him talking till but she 
got frightened just got frightened and hid her face in 
her hands then he caught her up it was the 
maids ran in just then   why them said 
  you used to try your fate yourself said 
her daughter   how does one do it in 
a inquired sonya   say you went to the 
now and listened it depends on what you hear hammering 
and bad but a sound of is good and one 
sometimes that too   tell us what happened to 
you in the  smiled   i forgotten she 
replied  none of you would go   i 
will let me i go said sonya   why 
not if you not afraid   ivanovna may i 
asked sonya  whether they were playing the ring and 
string game or the game or talking as now nicholas 
did not leave sonya side and gazed at her with 
quite new eyes it seemed to him that it was 
only today to that burnt mustache that he had fully 
learned to know her and really that evening sonya was 
more animated and prettier than nicholas had ever seen her 
before   that what she is like what a 
fool i have been he thought gazing at her sparkling 
eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile her 
a smile he had never seen before   not 
afraid of anything said sonya  i go at once 
she got up  they told her where the was 
and how she should stand and listen and they her 
a cloak she threw this over her head and shoulders 
and glanced at nicholas   a darling that girl 
is thought he  what have i been thinking of 
till now  sonya went out into the passage to 
go to the nicholas went hastily to the front porch 
saying he felt too hot the crowd of people really 
had made the house  outside there was the same 
cold and the same moon but even than before the 
light was so strong and the snow with so many 
stars that one did not wish to look up at 
the sky and the real stars were the sky was 
black and while the earth was gay   am 
a fool a fool what have i been waiting for 
thought nicholas and running out from the porch he went 
round the corner of the house and along the path 
that led to the back porch he knew sonya would 
pass that way halfway lay some snow of and across 
and along them a of from the bare old fell 
on the snow and on the path this path led 
to the the of the and its snow that looked 
as if out of some precious stone in the a 
tree in the garden with the and then all was 
again perfectly silent his bosom seemed to not air but 
the strength of youth and  from the back porch 
came the sound of feet the steps the bottom step 
upon which snow had gave a ringing creak and he 
heard the voice of an old saying  straight along 
the path miss only don look back   am 
not afraid answered sonya voice and along the path toward 
nicholas came the sound of sonya feet in her thin 
shoes  sonya came along wrapped in her cloak she 
was only a of away when she saw him and 
to her too he was not the nicholas she had 
known and always slightly feared he was in a woman 
dress with hair and a happy smile new to sonya 
she ran rapidly toward him   different and yet 
the same thought nicholas looking at her face all lit 
up by the he slipped his arms under the cloak 
that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him 
and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache 
and had a smell of burnt sonya kissed him full 
on the lips and her little hands pressed them to 
his   nicholas was all they said they ran 
to the and then back again he by the front 
and she by the back porch     
 chapter xii   when they all drove back 
from natasha who always saw and noticed everything arranged that 
she and madame should go back in the with and 
sonya with nicholas and the maids  on the way 
back nicholas drove at a steady instead of and kept 
by that all light into sonya face and searching beneath 
the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present 
sonya from whom he had never to be again he 
looked and in her both the old and the new 
sonya and being reminded by the smell of burnt of 
the of her kiss inhaled the air with a full 
breast and looking at the ground flying beneath him and 
at the sparkling sky felt himself again in   
is it well with thee he asked from time to 
time   she replied  with thee  when 
halfway home nicholas the to the and ran for a 
moment to natasha and stood on its   he 
whispered in french  you know i have made up 
my mind about sonya   you told her asked 
natasha suddenly beaming all over with joy   how 
strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows natasha 
you glad   am so glad so glad i 
was beginning to be vexed with you i did not 
tell you but you have been treating her badly what 
a heart she has nicholas i am horrid sometimes but 
i was ashamed to be happy while sonya was not 
continued natasha  i am so glad well run back 
to her   wait a bit oh how funny 
you look cried nicholas into her face and finding in 
his sister too something new and tender that he had 
not seen in her before  it isn it  
 she replied  have done splendidly   i 
seen her before as she is now thought nicholas  
should long ago have asked her what to do and 
have done she told me and all would have been 
well   you are glad and i have done 
right   quite right i had a with mamma 
some time ago about it mamma said she was for 
you how could she say such a thing i nearly 
at mamma i will never let anyone say anything bad 
of sonya for there is nothing but good in her 
  it all right said nicholas again scrutinizing the 
expression of his sister face to see if she was 
in then he jumped down and his the snow ran 
back to his the same happy smiling with mustache and 
beaming eyes looking up from under a was still sitting 
there and that was sonya and that sonya was certainly 
his future happy and wife  when they reached home 
and had told their mother how they had spent the 
evening at the the girls went to their when they 
had but without off the they sat a long time 
talking of their happiness they talked of how they would 
live when they were married how their husbands would be 
friends and how happy they would be on natasha table 
stood two looking glasses which had prepared   when 
will all that be i am afraid never it would 
be too good said natasha rising and going to the 
looking glasses   down natasha perhaps you see him 
said sonya  natasha lit the candles one on each 
side of one of the looking glasses and sat down 
  see someone with a mustache said natasha seeing 
her own face   laugh miss said  with 
sonya help and the maid natasha got the glass she 
held into the right position opposite the other her face 
assumed a serious expression and she sat silent she sat 
a long time looking at the line of candles reflected 
in the glasses and expecting  she had heard to 
see a or him prince andrew in that last square 
but ready as she was to take the for the 
of a man or of a she saw nothing she 
began rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses  
 is it others see things and i don she 
said  sit down now sonya you absolutely must tonight 
do it for me today i feel so frightened  
sonya sat down before the glasses got the right position 
and began looking   miss sonya is sure to 
see something whispered  you do nothing but laugh  
sonya heard this and natasha whisper   know she 
will she saw something last year  for about three 
minutes all were silent   course she will whispered 
natasha but did not finish suddenly sonya pushed away the 
glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her 
hand   natasha she cried   you see 
did you what was it exclaimed natasha holding up the 
looking glass  sonya had not seen anything she was 
just to and to get up when she heard natasha 
say  course she will she did not wish to 
disappoint either or natasha but it was hard to sit 
still she did not herself know how or why the 
her when she covered her eyes   saw him 
natasha her hand   wait a bit i saw 
him sonya could not help saying not yet knowing whom 
natasha meant by him nicholas or prince andrew   
why i say i saw something others do see besides 
who can tell whether i saw anything or not flashed 
through sonya mind   i saw him she said 
  standing or lying   i saw at 
first there was nothing then i saw him lying down 
  lying is he ill asked natasha her frightened 
eyes fixed on her friend   on the contrary 
on the contrary his face was cheerful and he turned 
to me and when saying this she herself she had 
really seen what she described   and then sonya 
  that i could not make out what there 
was something blue and red   when will he 
come back when shall i see him o god how 
afraid i am for him and for myself and about 
everything natasha began and without to sonya words of she 
got into bed and long after her was out lay 
open and gazing at the through the    
  chapter xiii   soon after the nicholas 
told his mother of his love for sonya and of 
his firm to marry her the countess who had long 
noticed what was going on between them and was expecting 
this declaration listened to him in silence and then told 
her son that he might marry whom he pleased but 
that neither she nor his father would give their to 
such a nicholas for the first time felt that his 
mother was with him and that despite her love for 
him she would not give way coldly without looking at 
her son she sent for her husband and when he 
came tried and coldly to inform him of the in 
her son presence but unable to restrain herself she burst 
into tears of vexation and left the room the old 
count began to nicholas and beg him to his purpose 
nicholas replied that he could not go back on his 
word and his father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon 
became silent and went in to the countess in all 
his with his son the count was always conscious of 
his own toward him for having wasted the family fortune 
and so he could not be angry with him for 
to marry an and choosing the sonya on this occasion 
he was only more conscious of the fact that if 
his affairs had not been in no better wife for 
nicholas than sonya could have been wished for and that 
no one but himself with his and his uncomfortable was 
to for the condition of the family  the father 
and mother did not speak of the matter to their 
son again but a few days later the countess sent 
for sonya and with a neither of them expected her 
niece for trying to catch nicholas and for sonya listened 
silently with eyes to the countess cruel words without understanding 
what was of her she was ready to sacrifice everything 
for her self was her most idea but in this 
case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice 
or for whom she could not help the countess and 
the whole rostov family but neither could she help nicholas 
and knowing that his happiness on that love she was 
silent and sad and did not reply nicholas felt the 
situation to be and went to have an with his 
mother he first her to forgive him and sonya and 
consent to their then he that if she sonya he 
would at once marry her secretly  the countess with 
a her son had never seen in her before replied 
that he was of age that prince andrew was marrying 
without his father consent and he could do the same 
but that she would never receive that as her daughter 
 at the word nicholas raising his voice told his 
mother he had never expected her to try to force 
him to sell his but if that were so he 
would say for the last time but he had no 
time to utter the word which the expression of his 
face his mother to with and which would perhaps have 
forever remained a cruel memory to them both he had 
not time to say it for natasha with a pale 
and set face entered the room from the door at 
which she had been listening   you are talking 
nonsense be quiet be quiet be quiet i tell you 
she almost screamed so as to his voice   
darling it not at all so my poor sweet darling 
she said to her mother who conscious that they had 
been on the of a gazed at her son with 
but in the and excitement of the could not and 
would not give way   i explain to you 
go away listen mamma darling said natasha  her words 
were but they the purpose at which she was aiming 
 the countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her 
daughter breast while nicholas rose his head and left the 
room  natasha set to work to effect a and 
so far succeeded that nicholas received a promise from his 
mother that sonya should not be while he on his 
side promised not to anything without his parents knowledge  
firmly after putting his affairs in order in the regiment 
to retire from the army and return and marry sonya 
nicholas serious and at with his parents but as it 
seemed to him passionately in love left at the beginning 
of to his regiment  after nicholas had gone things 
in the rostov household were more than ever and the 
countess fell ill from mental agitation  sonya was unhappy 
at the from nicholas and still more so on account 
of the tone the countess could not help toward her 
the count was more than ever by the condition of 
his affairs which called for some their town house and 
near moscow had to be and for this they had 
to go to moscow but the countess health them to 
delay their from day to day  natasha who had 
the first period of from her lightly and even now 
grew more agitated and impatient every day the thought that 
her best days which she would have employed in him 
were being wasted with no to anyone tormented her his 
for the most part her it hurt her to think 
that while she lived only in the thought of him 
he was living a real life seeing new places and 
new people that interested him the more interesting his were 
the more vexed she felt her to him far from 
giving her any seemed to her a wearisome and artificial 
obligation she could not write because she could not the 
of expressing sincerely in a letter even a part of 
what she expressed by voice smile and glance she wrote 
to him monotonous and dry to which she attached no 
importance herself and in the rough of which the countess 
her in  there was still no in the countess 
health but it was impossible to the to moscow any 
longer natasha had to be ordered and the house moreover 
prince andrew was expected in moscow where old prince bolkonski 
was spending the winter and natasha felt sure he had 
already arrived  so the countess remained in the country 
and the count taking sonya and natasha with him went 
to moscow at the end of     
 book eight        
 chapter i   after prince andrew to natasha 
pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to 
go on living as before firmly convinced as he was 
of the revealed to him by his benefactor and happy 
as he had been in his inner man to which 
he had devoted himself with such the of such a 
life vanished after the of andrew and natasha and the 
death of the news of which reached him almost at 
the same time only the of life remained his house 
a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a 
very important acquaintance with all petersburg and his court service 
with its dull and this life suddenly seemed to pierre 
unexpectedly he ceased keeping a the company of the began 
going to the club again drank a great deal and 
came once more in touch with the bachelor sets leading 
such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary 
to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that 
she was right and to avoid her went away to 
moscow  in moscow as soon as he entered his 
huge house in which the faded and princesses still lived 
with its enormous as soon as through the town he 
saw the with burning before the of the the square 
with its snow by the and of the those old 
who desired nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days 
leisurely when he saw those old moscow ladies the moscow 
balls and the english club he felt himself at home 
in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace 
at home warm and dirty as in an old gown 
 moscow society from the old women down to the 
children received pierre like a long whose place was always 
ready awaiting him for moscow society pierre was the most 
intellectual and most of a of the old russian type 
his purse was always empty because it was open to 
everyone  poor statues and one and nothing met with 
a from him and had it not been for two 
friends who had large from him and taken him under 
their he would have given everything away there was never 
a dinner or soiree at the club without him as 
soon as he into his place on the sofa after 
two bottles of he was and talking and began when 
there were his kindly smile and well the the were 
dull and when he was not there  when after 
a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly 
smile to the entreaties of the company to drive off 
somewhere with them shouts of and among the young men 
at balls he danced if a partner was young ladies 
married and unmarried liked him because without making love to 
any of them he was amiable to all especially after 
supper  est charmant il de  they said of 
him         is 
charming he has no   pierre was one of 
those gentlemen of whom there were good ending their days 
in moscow  how he would have been seven years 
before when he first arrived from abroad had he been 
told that there was no need for him to or 
plan anything that his had long been and that as 
he might he would be what all in his position 
were he could not have believed it had he not 
at one time with all his heart to establish a 
in russia then himself to be a napoleon then to 
be a and then a and the of napoleon had 
he not seen the of and passionately desired the of 
the human race and his own progress to the highest 
degree of perfection had he not and and his serfs 
 but instead of all that he was the wealthy 
husband of an wife a fond of and drinking and 
as he his waistcoat of the government a bit a 
member of the moscow english club and a favorite in 
moscow society for a long time he could not himself 
to the idea that he was one of those same 
moscow gentlemen he had so seven years before  sometimes 
he himself with the thought that he was only living 
this life but then he was by the thought of 
how many like himself had entered that life and that 
club with all their teeth and hair and had only 
left it when not a single or hair remained  
in moments of pride when he thought of his position 
it seemed to him that he was quite different and 
distinct from those other gentlemen he had they were empty 
stupid fellows satisfied with their position  i am still 
and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all 
these comrades of mine just like me and something new 
a path in life of their own and like me 
were brought by force of circumstances society and race that 
force against which man is powerless the condition i am 
in said he to himself in moments of and after 
living some time in moscow he no longer but began 
to grow fond of to respect and to pity his 
comrades in destiny as he pitied himself  pierre no 
longer moments of despair and with life but the that 
had found expression in such was driven and never left 
him for a moment  for why what is going 
on in the world he would ask himself in several 
times a day beginning to on the meaning of the 
of life but knowing by experience that there were no 
to these questions he made to turn away from them 
and took up a book or hurried of to the 
club or to nikolaevich to the gossip of the town 
  who has never cared for anything but her 
own body and is one of the women in the 
world thought pierre  regarded by people as the of 
intelligence and and they pay to her napoleon bonaparte was 
by all as long as he was great but now 
that he has become a wretched the emperor wants to 
him his daughter in an the through the praise to 
god for their over the french on the of and 
the french also through the praise because on that same 
of they the my brother by the blood that they 
are ready to sacrifice everything for their but they do 
not give a each to the for the poor and 
they the against the and about an and a that 
and the meaning of which the very man who wrote 
it does not understand we all the christian law of 
forgiveness of and love of our neighbors the law in 
honor of which we have built in moscow forty times 
forty yesterday a was to death and a of that 
same law of love and forgiveness a gave the a 
cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and 
the whole of this general which everyone accustomed as he 
was to it astonished him each time as if it 
were something new  understand the and he thought  
how am i to tell them all that i see 
i have tried and have always found that they too 
in the of their understand it as i do and 
only try not to see it so it that it 
must be so but i is to become of me 
thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially 
russians have of seeing and in the of goodness and 
truth but of seeing the and of life too clearly 
to be able to take a serious part in it 
every of work was connected in his eyes with and 
he tried to be he engaged in the and of 
it him and every path of yet he had to 
live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to 
be under the burden of these so he himself to 
any distraction in order to forget them he every kind 
of society drank much engaged in building and above all 
 he read and read everything that came to hand 
on coming home while his were still taking off his 
things he picked up a book and began to read 
from reading he passed to from to gossip in drawing 
rooms of the club from gossip to and women from 
back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more and 
more a and also a necessity though the doctors him 
that with his wine was dangerous for him he drank 
a great deal he was only quite at ease when 
having several glasses of wine into his large mouth he 
felt a pleasant in his body an amiability toward all 
his fellows and a to to every idea without it 
deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he 
feel that the of life which had terrified him was 
not as dreadful as he had thought he was always 
conscious of some of that as with a in his 
head after dinner or supper he or listened to conversation 
or read but under the influence of wine he said 
to himself  doesn matter i get it i have 
a ready but have no time now think it all 
out later on but the later on never came  
in the morning on an empty all the old questions 
appeared as and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked 
up a book and if anyone came to see him 
he was glad  sometimes he remembered how he had 
heard that soldiers in war when under the fire if 
they have nothing to do try hard to find some 
occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre 
all men seemed like those soldiers from life some in 
some in cards some in some in women some in 
some in horses some in politics some in some in 
wine and some in affairs  is trivial and nothing 
is important it all the same to save from it 
as best one can thought pierre  not to see 
it that dreadful it      chapter 
ii   at the beginning of winter prince nicholas 
bolkonski and his daughter moved to moscow at that time 
enthusiasm for the emperor alexander regime had and a and 
there and this together with his past and his and 
his at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object of 
particular respect to the and the center of the moscow 
to the government  the prince had aged very much 
that year he showed signs of by a to fall 
of quite remembrance of ones and the childish vanity with 
which he the role of head of the moscow in 
spite of this the old man inspired in all his 
visitors alike a feeling of of an evening when he 
came in to tea in his old coat and and 
by anyone told his stories of the past or uttered 
yet more and of the present for them all that 
old house with its gigantic footmen and the stern old 
man  a of the past century with his gentle 
daughter and the pretty who were devoted to him a 
and agreeable but the visitors did not that besides the 
of hours during which they saw their host there were 
also twenty hours in the day during which the private 
and intimate life of the house continued  that private 
life had become very trying for princess mary there in 
moscow she was of her greatest with the and the 
which her at bald hills she had none of the 
advantages and of city life she did not go out 
into society everyone knew that her father would not let 
her go anywhere without him and his health prevented his 
going out himself so that she was not to and 
evening parties she had quite the hope of getting married 
she saw the and with which the old prince received 
and dismissed the young men possible who sometimes appeared at 
their house she had no friends during this visit to 
moscow she had been in the two who had been 
to her mademoiselle with whom she had never been able 
to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to her 
and for reasons princess mary her julie with whom she 
had for the last five years was in moscow but 
to be quite to her when they met just then 
julie who by the death of her had become one 
of the in moscow was in the full whirl of 
society she was by young men who she had suddenly 
learned to appreciate her worth julie was at that in 
the life of a society woman when she that her 
last of marrying has come and that her fate must 
be decided now or never on princess mary remembered with 
a mournful smile that she now had no one to 
write to since julie presence gave her no pleasure was 
here and they met every week like the old who 
declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent 
his for years she julie presence and having no one 
to write to in moscow princess mary had no one 
to talk to no one to whom to her sorrow 
and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the 
time for prince andrew return and was approaching but his 
request to her to prepare his father for it had 
not been carried out in fact it seemed as if 
matters were quite hopeless for at every mention of the 
young countess rostova the old prince  apart from that 
was usually in a bad lost control of himself another 
lately added sorrow from the lessons she gave her six 
year to her she in herself in relation to little 
nicholas some of her father however often she told herself 
that she must not get when her almost every time 
that in hand she sat down to show him the 
french she so to her own knowledge quickly and easily 
into the child was already afraid that might at any 
moment get angry at his slightest inattention she trembled became 
and raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the 
arm and put him in the corner having put him 
in the corner she would herself begin to cry over 
her cruel nature and little nicholas following her example would 
sob and without would leave his corner come to her 
pull her hands from her face and her but what 
distressed the princess most of all was her father which 
was always against her and had of late to had 
he forced her to herself to the ground all night 
had he her or made her wood or water it 
would never have entered her mind to think her position 
hard but this more cruel because he loved her and 
for that reason tormented himself and her how not merely 
to hurt and her deliberately but to show her that 
she was always to for everything of late he had 
a new that tormented princess mary more than anything else 
this was his ever with mademoiselle the idea that at 
the first moment of receiving the news of his son 
intentions had occurred to him in if andrew got married 
he himself would marry evidently pleased him and he had 
and as it seemed to princess mary merely to her 
shown special to the companion and expressed his with his 
daughter by of love of  one day in moscow 
in princess mary presence  thought her father did it 
when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle hand 
and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately princess mary 
flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes 
later mademoiselle came into princess mary room smiling and making 
cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily away 
her tears went up to mademoiselle and evidently of what 
she was doing began shouting in angry at the her 
voice breaking  horrible to take of the weakness she 
did not finish  my room she exclaimed and burst 
into  next day the prince did not say a 
word to his daughter but she noticed that at dinner 
he gave orders that mademoiselle should be served first after 
dinner when the footman and from habit began with the 
princess the prince suddenly grew threw his stick at and 
instantly gave to have him for the army   
doesn obey i said it twice and he doesn obey 
she is the first person in this house she my 
best friend cried the prince  if you allow yourself 
he screamed in a addressing princess mary for the first 
time  forget yourself again before her as you dared 
to do yesterday i will show you who is in 
this house go don let me set eyes on you 
beg her  princess mary asked mademoiselle and also her 
father for herself and for the footman who had begged 
for her  at such moments something like a pride 
of sacrifice gathered in her soul and suddenly that father 
whom she had would look for his spectacles in her 
presence near them and not seeing them or would forget 
something that had just occurred or take a step with 
his legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed 
his or of all at dinner when there were no 
visitors to him would suddenly fall letting his napkin drop 
and his shaking head over his plate  is old 
and and i to him she thought at such moments 
with a feeling of against herself     
 chapter iii   in  there was living 
in moscow a french doctor had rapidly become the fashion 
he was tall handsome amiable as are and was as 
all moscow said an clever doctor he was received in 
the best not merely as a doctor but as an 
equal  prince nicholas had always but on mademoiselle advice 
had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown 
accustomed to him came to see the prince about twice 
a week  on  nicholas day and the prince 
name day moscow came to the prince front door but 
he gave orders to admit no one and to invite 
to dinner only a small number a list of whom 
he gave to princess mary  who came in the 
morning with his considered it proper in his of doctor 
de la  as he told princess mary and went 
in to see the prince it happened that on that 
morning of his name day the prince was in one 
of his he had been going about the house all 
the morning finding with everyone and not to understand what 
was said to him and not to be understood himself 
princess mary well knew this mood of quiet which generally 
in a burst of and she went about all that 
morning as though facing a and and the until the 
doctor arrival the morning had passed off after admitting the 
doctor princess mary sat down with a book in the 
drawing room near the door through which she could hear 
all that passed in the study     
   to force the   at first 
she heard only voice then her father then both voices 
began speaking at the same time the door was open 
and on the appeared the handsome figure of the terrified 
with his of black hair and the prince in his 
gown and his face distorted with and the of his 
eyes rolled downwards   don understand shouted the prince 
 i do french slave of buonaparte get out of 
my house be off i tell you  shrugging his 
shoulders went up to mademoiselle who at the sound of 
shouting had run in from an adjoining room   
prince is not very well and rush of blood to 
the head keep calm i will call again tomorrow said 
and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away 
 through the study door came the sound of feet 
and the cry  everywhere not a moment peace in 
my own house  after the old prince called his 
daughter in and the whole weight of his fell on 
her she was to that a had been had he 
not told her yes told her to make a list 
and not to admit anyone who was not on that 
list then why was that she was the cause of 
it all with her he said he could not have 
a moment peace and could not die quietly   
ma we must part we must part understand that understand 
it i cannot endure any more he said and left 
the room then as if afraid she might find some 
means of he returned and trying to appear calm added 
 don imagine i have said this in a moment 
of anger i am calm i have thought it over 
and it will be carried out must part so find 
some place for yourself but he could not restrain himself 
and with the of which only one who is capable 
evidently suffering himself he shook his at her and screamed 
  only some fool would marry her then he 
the door sent for mademoiselle and into his study  
at two o the six guests assembled for dinner  
these guests famous count prince with his general an old 
war of the prince and of the younger generation pierre 
and boris the prince in the drawing room  boris 
who had come to moscow on leave a few days 
before had been anxious to be to prince nicholas bolkonski 
and had to himself so well that the old prince 
in his case made an exception to the rule of 
not receiving in his house  the prince house did 
not belong to what is known as fashionable society but 
his little circle not much talked about in town one 
it was more to be received in than any other 
boris had realized this the week before when the commander 
in chief in his presence to dinner on st nicholas 
day and had replied that he could not come  
 that day i always go to pay my to 
the of prince nicholas bolkonski   yes yes replied 
the commander in chief  is he  the small 
group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old drawing 
room with its old the solemn gathering of a court 
of all were silent or talked in low tones prince 
nicholas came in serious and princess mary seemed even and 
more than usual the guests were to her feeling that 
she was in no mood for their conversation count alone 
kept the conversation going now the latest town news and 
now the latest political gossip  and the old general 
occasionally took part in the conversation prince bolkonski listened as 
a judge a report only now and then silently or 
by a word showing that he took of what was 
being to him the tone of the conversation was such 
as indicated that no one of what was being done 
in the political world were related evidently the opinion that 
everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling 
a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped 
or was stopped at the point which his might touch 
the sovereign himself  at dinner the talk turned on 
the latest political news napoleon of the of and the 
russian note to napoleon which had been sent to all 
the   europe as a does a captured said 
count repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before 
 only at the long or of the heads now 
the turn has come and bonaparte doesn to the head 
of the all keep silent our sovereign alone has against 
the of the of and even count paused feeling that 
he had reached the which censure was impossible   
have been offered in for the of said prince bolkonski 
 the about as i might move my serfs from 
bald hills to or my estates   of his 
with strength of character and resignation remarked boris joining in 
respectfully  he said this because on his from petersburg 
he had had the honor of being to the prince 
bolkonski glanced at the young man as if about to 
say something in reply but changed his mind evidently considering 
him too young   have read our about the 
affair and was surprised how badly the note was remarked 
count in the tone of a man with a subject 
quite familiar to him  pierre looked at with naive 
not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad 
of the note   it matter count how the 
note is he asked  long as its is  
 dear fellow with our five hundred thousand it should 
be easy to have a good style returned count  
pierre now understood the count with the of the note 
  would have thought enough had sprung up remarked 
the old prince  in petersburg they are always notes 
only but even new my andrew there has written a 
whole of for russia they are always and he laughed 
unnaturally  there was a momentary pause in the conversation 
the old general his to draw attention   you 
hear of the last at the in petersburg the figure 
cut by the new french ambassador   yes i 
heard something he said something awkward in his majesty presence 
  majesty drew attention to the and to the 
march past continued the general  it seems the ambassador 
took no notice and allowed himself to reply that  
in france pay no attention to such trifles the emperor 
did not to reply at the next they say the 
emperor did not once to him  all were silent 
on this fact to the emperor personally it was impossible 
to pass any   fellows said the prince  
know i turned him out of my house this morning 
he was here they him in spite of my request 
that they should let no one in he went on 
glancing angrily at his daughter  and he his whole 
conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced 
him that was a though these reasons were very and 
no one made any rejoinder  after the roast champagne 
was served the guests rose to congratulate the old prince 
princess mary too went round to him  he gave 
her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled 
clean to kiss the whole expression of his face told 
her that he had not forgotten the morning talk that 
his decision remained in force and only the presence of 
visitors his speaking of it to her now  when 
they went into the drawing room where was served the 
old men sat together  prince nicholas grew more animated 
and expressed his views on the war  he said 
that our wars with bonaparte would be so long as 
we alliances with the and thrust ourselves into affairs into 
which we had been drawn by the peace of  
ought not to fight either for or against austria our 
political interests are all in the east and in regard 
to bonaparte the only thing is to have an and 
a firm and he will never to cross the russian 
as was the case in    can we 
fight the french prince said count  we arm ourselves 
against our and look at our look at our ladies 
the french are our paris is our of heaven  
he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone 
  dresses french ideas french there now you turned 
out by the of his neck because he is a 
frenchman and a but our ladies after him on their 
knees i went to a party last night and there 
out of five ladies three were and had the for

at our public if i may say so ah when 
one looks at our young people prince one would like 
to take peter the great old out of the and 
them in the russian way till all the nonsense out 
of them  all were silent the old prince looked 
at with a smile and his head approvingly   
good your excellency keep well said getting up with and 
holding out his hand to the prince   my 
dear fellow his words are music i never of hearing 
him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand 
and his to be kissed  following example the others 
also rose      chapter iv  
 princess mary as she sat listening to the old 
men talk and understood nothing of what she heard she 
only wondered whether the guests had all observed her father 
attitude toward her she did not even notice the special 
attentions and shown her during dinner by boris who was 
visiting them for the third time already  princess mary 
turned with absent look to pierre who hat in hand 
and with a smile on his face was the last 
of the guests to her after the old prince had 
gone out and they were left alone in the drawing 
room   i stay a little longer he said 
letting his stout body into an armchair beside her  
 yes she answered  noticed nothing her look asked 
 pierre was in an agreeable after mood he looked 
straight before him and smiled quietly   you known 
that young man long princess he asked    
   not long   you like him 
  he is an agreeable young man why do 
you ask me that said princess mary still thinking of 
that morning conversation with her father   i have 
noticed that when a young man comes on leave from 
petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of 
marrying an   have observed that said princess mary 
  returned pierre with a smile  this young 
man now matters so that where there is a wealthy 
there he is too i can read him like a 
book at present he is whom to lay to or 
mademoiselle julie karagina he is very attentive to her  
 visits them   very often and do you 
know the new way of said pierre with an amused 
smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good for which 
he so often himself in his   replied princess 
mary   please moscow girls one has to be 
melancholy he is very melancholy with mademoiselle karagina said pierre 
  asked princess mary looking into pierre kindly face 
and still thinking of her own sorrow  would be 
a relief thought she  i to what i am 
feeling to someone i should like to tell everything to 
pierre he is kind and it would be a relief 
he would give me advice   you marry him 
  my god count there are moments when i 
would marry anybody she cried suddenly to her own surprise 
and with tears in her voice  how it is 
to love someone near to you and to feel that 
she went on in a voice  you can do 
nothing for him but him and to know that you 
cannot this then there is only one thing left go 
away but where could i go   is wrong 
what is it princess  but without finishing what she 
was saying princess mary burst into tears   don 
know what is the matter with me today don take 
any notice what i have said  pierre gaiety vanished 
completely he anxiously the princess asked her to speak out 
fully and her to him but she only repeated that 
she begged him to forget what she had said that 
she did not remember what she had said and that 
she had no trouble except the one he knew of 
prince andrew to cause a between father and son  
 you any news of the rostovs she asked to 
change the subject  was told they are coming soon

   chapter v   boris had not 
succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so with 
the same object in he came to moscow there he 
wavered between the two julie and princess mary though princess 
mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than 
julie he without knowing why felt awkward about paying court 
to her when they had last met on the old 
prince name day she had answered at random all his 
to talk evidently not listening to what he was saying 
 julie on the contrary his attentions though in a 
manner peculiar to herself  she was twenty after the 
death of her she had become very wealthy she was 
by now plain but thought herself not merely as good 
as before but even far more attractive she was in 
this by the fact that she had become a very 
wealthy and also by the fact that the older she 
grew the less dangerous she became to men and the 
more they could with her and themselves of her and 
the animated company that assembled at her house without any 
obligation a man who would have been afraid ten years 
before of going every day to the house when there 
was a girl of there for fear of her and 
himself would now go boldly every day and treat her 
not as a girl but as a acquaintance  that 
winter the house was the most agreeable and in moscow 
in addition to the evening and dinner parties a large 
company chiefly of men gathered there every day at and 
staying till three in the morning julie never a ball 
a or a play her dresses were always of the 
latest fashion but in spite of that she seemed to 
be about everything and told everyone that she did not 
believe either in friendship or in love or any of 
the joys of life and expected peace only  she 
adopted the tone of one who has a great like 
a girl who has either lost the man she loved 
or been by him though nothing of the kind had 
happened to her she was regarded in that light and 
had even herself come to believe that she had much 
in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing 
herself did not the young people who came to her 
house from passing the time every visitor who came to 
the house paid his to the melancholy mood of the 
hostess and then amused himself with society gossip dancing intellectual 
games and which were in vogue at the only a 
few of these young men among them boris entered more 
deeply into julie melancholy and with these she had conversations 
in private on the vanity of all things and to 
them she showed her filled with mournful and verses  
to boris julie was particularly gracious she his early with 
life offered him such of friendship as she who had 
herself so much could and showed him her boris two 
in the and wrote  your dark branches and melancholy 
upon me  on another page he drew a and 
wrote      la est la est 
tranquille     ah il a d  
       death gives relief 
and death is   ah from suffering there is 
no other  julie said this was charming   
is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she 
said to boris repeating word for word a passage she 
had copied from a book  is a of light 
in the a between sadness and despair showing the of 
 in reply boris wrote these lines    
  de d sensible     qui 
le me impossible     ah me  
   calmer de ma     
une     a je    
       of a too 
soul      without whom happiness would 
for me be impossible      tender 
melancholy ah come to console me     
 come to calm the torments of my gloomy  
    and a secret    
  with these tears that i feel to be 
  for boris julie played most on her harp 
boris read  aloud to her and more than once 
interrupted the reading because of the that him meeting at 
large gatherings julie and boris looked on one another as 
the only who understood one another in a world of 
indifferent people  anna mikhaylovna who often the while playing 
cards with the mother made as to julie  was 
to have two estates in and the anna mikhaylovna regarded 
the refined sadness that her son to the wealthy julie 
with and resignation to the will   are always 
charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to the 
daughter  says his soul finds at your house he 
has so many and is so said she to the 
mother  my dear i can tell you how fond 
i have grown of julie she said to her son 
 who could help her she is an being ah 
boris boris paused  how i pity her mother she 
went on  she showed me her accounts and from 
 have enormous estates there and she poor thing has 
no one to help her and they do her so 
 boris smiled almost while listening to his mother he 
laughed at her naive but listened to what she had 
to say and sometimes her carefully about the and estates 
 julie had long been expecting a from her melancholy 
and was ready to accept it but some secret feeling 
of for her for her passionate desire to get married 
for her and a feeling of horror at the of 
real love still boris his leave was he spent every 
day and whole days at the and every day on 
thinking the matter over told himself that he would tomorrow 
but in julie presence looking at her red face and 
 always her eyes and her expression of continual to 
pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural of married 
boris could not utter the words though in he had 
long regarded himself as the of those and estates and 
had the use of the income from them julie saw 
boris and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she 
was to him but her feminine self immediately her with 
and she told herself that he was only shy from 
love her melancholy however began to turn to and not 
long before boris she formed a definite plan of just 
as boris leave of was anatole kuragin made his appearance 
in moscow and of course in the drawing room and 
julie suddenly her melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to 
kuragin   dear said anna mikhaylovna to her son 
 know from a that prince vasili has sent his 
son to moscow to get him married to julie i 
am so fond of julie that i should be sorry 
for her what do you think of it my dear 
 the idea of being made a fool of and 
of having thrown away that whole month of melancholy service 
to julie and of seeing all the from the estates 
which he had already mentally and put to proper use 
fall into the hands of another and especially into the 
hands of that idiot anatole boris he drove to the 
with the firm intention of julie met him in a 
gay careless manner spoke of how she had enjoyed yesterday 
ball and asked when he was leaving though boris had 
come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant 
to be tender he began speaking of feminine of how 
easily women can turn from sadness to joy and how 
their solely on who happens to be paying court to 
them julie was offended and replied that it was true 
that a woman and the same thing over and over 
again would weary anyone   i should advise you 
boris began wishing to her but at that instant the 
thought occurred to him that he might have to leave 
moscow without having accomplished his aim and have wasted his 
was a thing he never allowed to happen  he 
checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his 
eyes to avoid seeing her and face and said  
 did not come here at all to with you 
on the contrary  he glanced at her to make 
sure that he might go on her had suddenly quite 
vanished and her anxious eyes were fixed on him with 
 can always arrange so as not to see her 
often thought boris  affair has been and must be 
finished he blushed raised his eyes to hers and said 
  know my for you  there was no 
need to say more julie face shone with and self 
but she forced boris to say all that is said 
on such he loved her and had never loved any 
other woman more than her she knew that for the 
estates and she could demand this and she received what 
she demanded  the no longer to that and melancholy 
upon them the of a splendid house in petersburg paid 
calls and prepared everything for a brilliant

vii   next day by marya dmitrievna advice count 
rostov took natasha to call on prince nicholas bolkonski the 
count did not set out on this visit at heart 
he felt afraid he well remembered the last interview he 
had had with the old prince at the time of 
the when in reply to an invitation to dinner he 
had had to listen to an angry for not having 
his full of men natasha on the other hand having 
put on her best gown was in the highest  
can help me she thought  always has liked me 
and i am so to do anything they wish so 
ready to be fond of him being his father of 
her being his sister there is no reason for them 
not to like me  they drove up to the 
gloomy old house on the and entered the   
the have mercy on us said the count half in 
half in but natasha noticed that her father was flurried 
on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether 
the prince and princess were at home  when they 
had been announced a was among the the footman who 
had gone to announce them was stopped by another in 
the large hall and they whispered to one another then 
a ran into the hall and hurriedly said something the 
princess at last an old cross looking footman came and 
announced to the rostovs that the prince was not receiving 
but that the princess begged them to walk up the 
first person who came to meet the visitors was mademoiselle 
she greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and 
showed them to the princess room the princess looking and 
nervous her face flushed in ran in to meet the 
visitors heavily and trying to appear and at ease from 
the first glance princess mary did not like natasha she 
thought her too dressed gay and vain she did not 
at all that before having seen her future sister she 
was against her by involuntary of her beauty youth and 
happiness as well as by jealousy of her brother love 
for her apart from this to her princess mary was 
agitated just then because on the rostovs being announced the 
old prince had shouted that he did not wish to 
see them that princess mary might do so if she 
chose but they were not to be to him she 
had decided to receive them but feared the prince might 
at any moment in some as he seemed much upset 
by the rostovs visit   my dear princess i 
brought you my said the count and looking round uneasily 
as if afraid the old prince might appear  am 
so glad you should get to know one another very 
sorry the prince is still and after a few more 
remarks he rose  you allow me to leave my 
natasha in your hands for a of an hour princess 
i drive round to see anna it quite near in 
the dogs square and then i come back for her 
 the count had this  he afterwards told his 
daughter to give the future sisters an opportunity to talk 
to one another but another motive was to avoid the 
danger of the old prince of whom he was afraid 
he did not mention this to his daughter but natasha 
noticed her father and anxiety and felt mortified by it 
she blushed for him grew still at having blushed and 
looked at the princess with a bold and expression which 
said that she was not afraid of anybody the princess 
told the count that she would be delighted and only 
begged him to stay longer at anna and he departed 
 despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess 
mary wished to have a tete with natasha remained in 
the room and talked about moscow and natasha felt offended 
by the she had noticed in the anteroom by her 
father and by the unnatural manner of the princess who 
thought making a favor of receiving her and so everything 
her she did not like princess mary whom she thought 
very plain affected and dry natasha suddenly into herself and 
assumed an air which princess mary still more after five 
minutes of conversation they heard the sound of feet rapidly 
approaching princess mary looked frightened  the door opened and 
the old prince in a gown and a white came 
in   he began  countess countess rostova if 
i am not mistaken i beg you to excuse me 
to excuse me i did not know god is my 
witness i did not know you had us with a 
visit and i came in such a only to see 
my daughter i beg you to excuse me god is 
my witness i didn know he repeated stressing the word 
 so unnaturally and so that princess mary stood with 
eyes not daring to look either at her father or 
at natasha  nor did the latter having and know 
what to do mademoiselle alone smiled agreeably   beg 
you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness 
i did not know muttered the old man and after 
looking natasha over from head to foot he went out 
 mademoiselle was the first to herself after this and 
began speaking about the prince natasha and princess mary looked 
at one another in silence and the longer they did 
so without saying what they wanted to say the greater 
grew their to one another  when the count returned 
natasha was pleased and hastened to get away at that 
moment she the elderly princess who could place her in 
such an position and had spent half an hour with 
her without once prince andrew  couldn begin talking about 
him in the presence of that thought natasha the same 
thought was meanwhile princess mary she knew what she ought 
to have said to natasha but she had been unable 
to say it because mademoiselle was in the way and 
because without knowing why she felt it very difficult to 
speak of the when the count was already leaving the 
room princess mary went up hurriedly to natasha took her 
by the hand and said with a deep sigh  
 i must  natasha glanced at her ironically without 
knowing why   said princess mary  want you 
to know that i am glad my brother has found 
happiness  she paused feeling that she was not telling 
the truth natasha noticed this and guessed its reason  
 think princess it is not to speak of that 
now she said with dignity and though she felt the 
tears her   have i said and what have 
i done thought she as soon as she was out 
of the room  they waited a long time for 
natasha to come to dinner that day she sat in 
her room crying like a child her nose and sobbing 
sonya stood beside her kissing her hair   what 
is it about she asked  do they matter to 
you it will all pass natasha   if you 
only knew how offensive it was as if i  
 talk about it natasha it your so why should 
you mind kiss me said sonya  natasha raised her 
head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed her 
face against her   can tell you i don 
know no one to said natasha my but it all 
oh why doesn he come  she came in to 
dinner with red eyes marya dmitrievna who knew how the 
prince had received the rostovs pretended not to notice how 
upset natasha was and and loudly at table with the 
count and the other guests      
chapter viii   that evening the rostovs went to 
the for which marya dmitrievna had taken a box  
natasha did not want to go but could not refuse 
marya dmitrievna kind which was intended for her when she 
came ready dressed into the ballroom to her father and 
looking in the large mirror there saw that she was 
pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but it 
was a sweet tender sadness   god if he 
were here now i would not behave as i did 
then but differently i would not be silly and afraid 
of things i would simply embrace him to him and 
make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes 
with which he has so often looked at me and 
then i would make him laugh as he used to 
laugh and his eyes i see those eyes thought natasha 
 what do his father and sister matter to me 
i love him alone him him with that face and 
those eyes with his smile and yet childlike no i 
had better not think of him not think of him 
but forget him quite forget him for the present i 
can bear this waiting and i shall cry in a 
minute and she turned away from the glass making an 
effort not to cry  how can sonya love nicholas 
so and quietly and wait so long and so thought 
she looking at sonya who also came in quite ready 
with a in her hand  she different i can 
 natasha at that moment felt so and tender that 
it was not enough for her to love and know 
she was she wanted now at once to embrace the 
man she loved to speak and hear from him words 
of love such as filled her heart while she sat 
in the carriage beside her father pensively watching the lights 
of the street on the window she felt still and 
more in love and forgot where she was going and 
with whom having into the line of carriages the rostovs 
carriage drove up to the its wheels over the snow 
natasha and sonya holding up their dresses jumped out quickly 
the count got out helped by the footmen and passing 
among men and women who were entering and the program 
they all three went along the to the first row 
of through the closed doors the music was already audible 
  your hair whispered sonya  an and quickly 
slipped before the ladies and opened the door of their 
box the music sounded louder and through the door rows 
of lit in which ladies sat with bare arms and 
shoulders and brilliant with before their eyes a lady entering 
the next box a glance of feminine at natasha the 
had not yet and the was being played natasha smoothing 
her gown went in with sonya and sat down the 
brilliant of opposite a she had not experienced for a 
long time of of eyes looking at her bare arms 
and neck affected her both agreeably and and called up 
a whole crowd of desires and with that feeling  
the two remarkably pretty girls natasha and sonya with count 
rostov who had not been seen in moscow for a 
long time general attention moreover everybody knew of natasha to 
prince andrew and knew that the rostovs had lived in 
the country ever since and all looked with curiosity at 
a who was making one of the best in russia 
 natasha looks as everyone told her had in the 
country and that evening to her agitation she was particularly 
pretty she struck those who saw her by her of 
life and beauty with her indifference to everything about her 
her black eyes looked at the crowd without anyone and 
her delicate arm bare to above the elbow lay on 
the velvet edge of the box while evidently she opened 
and closed her hand in time to the music crumpling 
her program  there said sonya  her mother isn 
it   me michael has grown still remarked the 
count   at our anna mikhaylovna a she has 
on   julie boris with them one can see 
at once that they engaged   has   
yes i heard it today said shinshin coming into the 
rostovs box  natasha looked in the direction in which 
her father eyes were turned and saw julie sitting beside 
her mother with a happy look on her face and 
a string of round her thick red neck natasha knew 
was covered with behind them wearing a smile and over 
with an to julie mouth was boris handsome smoothly brushed 
head he looked at the rostovs from under his brows 
and said something smiling to his   are talking 
about us about me and him thought natasha  he 
no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they trouble 
themselves if only they knew how little i am concerned 
about any of them  behind them sat anna mikhaylovna 
wearing a green and with a happy look of resignation 
to the will of god on her face their box 
was by that of an which natasha knew so well 
and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered 
all that had been so humiliating in her morning visit 
  right has he not to wish to receive 
me into his family oh better not think of it 
till he comes back she told herself and began looking 
at the faces some strange and some familiar in the 
in the front in the very center back against the 
stood dolokhov in a dress his curly hair brushed up 
into a huge he stood in full of the audience 
well aware that he was everyone attention yet as much 
at ease as though he were in his own room 
around him moscow most brilliant young men whom he evidently 
 the count laughing the blushing sonya and pointed to 
her former   you recognize him said he  
where has he sprung from he asked turning to shinshin 
 he somewhere   did replied shinshin  was 
in the and ran away from there they say he 
has been as to some prince in where he killed 
the brother now all the moscow ladies are mad about 
him it  the that does it we never hear 
a word but dolokhov is mentioned they by him they 
him to you as they would a dish of choice 
dolokhov and anatole kuragin have turned all our ladies heads 
 a tall beautiful woman with a of hair and 
much exposed plump white shoulders and neck round which she 
wore a string of large entered the adjoining box rustling 
her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling 
into her place  natasha gazed at that neck those 
shoulders and and and the beauty of the shoulders and 
the while natasha was her on her for the second 
time the lady looked round and meeting the count eyes 
nodded to him and smiled she was the countess pierre 
wife and the count who knew everyone in society leaned 
over and spoke to her   you been here 
long countess he inquired  call i call to kiss 
your hand i here on business and have brought my 
girls with me they say acts count pierre never used 
to forget us is he here   he meant 
to look in answered helene and glanced attentively at natasha 
 count rostov resumed his seat   isn she 
he whispered to natasha   answered natasha  a 
woman one could easily fall in love with  just 
then the last of the were heard and the with 
his stick some took their seats in the and the 
rose  as soon as it rose everyone in the 
and became silent and all the men old and young 
in uniform and evening dress and all the women with 
on their bare turned their whole attention with eager curiosity 
to the natasha too began to look at it  
    chapter ix   the floor 
of the of at the sides was some and at 
the back was a over in the center of the 
sat some girls in red and white one very fat 
girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a 
low to the back of which a piece of green 
was they all sang something when they had finished their 
song the girl in white went up to the box 
and a man with silk over his stout legs and 
holding a plume and a went up to her and 
began his arms about  first the man in the 
sang alone then she sang then they both paused while 
the played and the man the hand of the girl 
in white obviously awaiting the beat to start with her 
they sang together and everyone in the began and shouting 
while the man and woman on the smiling spreading out 
their arms and  after her life in the country 
and in her present serious mood all this seemed and 
to natasha she could not follow the nor even listen 
to the music she saw only the and the dressed 
men and women who moved spoke and sang so in 
that brilliant light she knew what it was all meant 
to represent but it was so and unnatural that she 
first felt ashamed for the and then amused at them 
she looked at the faces of the audience in them 
the same sense of and she herself experienced but they 
all seemed attentive to what was on the and expressed 
which to natasha seemed feigned  suppose it has to 
be like this she thought she kept looking round in 
turn at the rows of heads in the and then 
at the women in the especially at helene in the 
next box who quite with a quiet smile not taking 
her eyes off the and feeling the bright light that 
the whole place and the warm air by the crowd 
natasha little by little began to pass into a state 
of she had not experienced for a long while she 
did not who and where she was nor what was 
going on before her as she looked and thought the 
fancies unexpectedly and passed through her mind the idea occurred 
to her of onto the edge of the box and 
the air the actress was then she wished to touch 
with her an old sitting not far from her then 
to over to helene and her  at a moment 
when all was quiet before the of a song a 
door leading to the on the side the rostovs box 
and the steps of a arrival were heard  kuragin 
whispered shinshin countess turned smiling to the and natasha following 
the direction of that look saw an handsome adjutant approaching 
their box with a self yet bearing this was anatole 
kuragin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at 
the ball in petersburg he was now in an adjutant 
uniform with one and a shoulder he moved with a 
which would have been had he not been so good 
and had his handsome face not worn such an expression 
of good and gaiety though the was he walked deliberately 
down the carpeted his sword and spurs slightly and his 
handsome head held high having looked at natasha he approached 
his sister laid his well hand on the edge of 
her box nodded to her and forward asked a question 
with a motion toward natasha   said he evidently 
referring to natasha who did not exactly hear his words 
but understood them from the movement of his lips then 
he took his place in the first row of the 
and sat down beside dolokhov with his elbow in a 
friendly and way that dolokhov whom others treated so he 
at him gaily smiled and rested his foot against the 
  like the brother is to the sister remarked 
the count  how handsome they both are  shinshin 
lowering his voice began to tell the count of some 
of kuragin in moscow and natasha tried to overhear it 
just because he had said she was   the 
first act was over in the everyone began moving about 
going out and coming in  boris came to the 
rostovs box received their very simply and raising his eyebrows 
with an absent smile to natasha and sonya his invitation 
to her and went away natasha with a gay coquettish 
smile talked to him and on his approaching that same 
boris with whom she had been in love in the 
state of she was in everything seemed simple and natural 
 the helene smiled at everyone in the same way 
and natasha gave boris a smile  helene box was 
filled and from the by the most distinguished and intellectual 
men who seemed to with one another in their wish 
to let everyone see that they knew her  during 
the whole of that kuragin stood with dolokhov in front 
of the looking at the rostovs box natasha knew he 
was talking about her and this her pleasure she even 
turned so that he should see her in what she 
thought was its most becoming before the beginning of the 
second act pierre appeared in the the rostovs had not 
seen him since their arrival his face looked sad and 
he had grown still since natasha last saw him he 
passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole 
went up to him and began speaking to him looking 
at and indicating the rostovs box on seeing natasha pierre 
grew animated and hastily passing between the rows came toward 
their box when he got there he leaned on his 
elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time 
while conversing with pierre natasha heard a man voice in 
countess box and something told her it was kuragin she 
turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed straight 
into her eyes with such an enraptured look that it 
seemed strange to be so near him to look at 
him like that to be so sure he her and 
not to be acquainted with him  in the second 
act there was there was a round hole in the 
canvas to represent the moon were raised over the and 
from and came deep notes while many people appeared from 
right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like 
in their hands they began their arms then some other 
people ran in and began away the who had been 
in white and was now in light blue they did 
not her away at once but sang with her for 
a long time and then at last her off and 
behind the scenes something was struck three times and everyone 
down and sang a all these things were interrupted by 
the enthusiastic shouts of the audience  during this act 
every time natasha looked toward the she saw anatole kuragin 
with an arm thrown across the back of his chair 
staring at her she was pleased to see that he 
was by her and it did not occur to her 
that there was anything wrong in it  when the 
second act was over countess rose turned to the rostovs 
box whole bosom completely exposed the old count with a 
finger and paying no attention to those who had entered 
her box began talking to him with an amiable smile 
  make me acquainted with your charming daughters said 
she  whole town is their and i don even 
know then  natasha rose and to the splendid countess 
she was so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty 
that she blushed with pleasure   want to become 
a too now said helene  is it you not 
ashamed to such in the country  countess quite deserved 
her reputation of being a fascinating woman she could say 
what she did not think what was simply and naturally 
  count you must let me look after your 
daughters though i am not staying here long this time 
are you will try to them i have already heard 
much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to 
know you said she to natasha with her and lovely 
smile  had heard about you from my page have 
you heard he is getting married and also from my 
husband friend bolkonski prince andrew bolkonski she went on with 
special emphasis that she knew of his relation to natasha 
to get better acquainted she asked that one of the 
young ladies should come into her box for the rest 
of the and natasha moved over to it  the 
scene of the third act a in which many candles 
were burning and of with short on the in the 
middle stood what were probably a king and a queen 
the king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang 
something badly and sat down on a crimson throne the 
who had been first in white and then in light 
blue now wore only a and stood beside the throne 
with her hair down she sang something addressing the queen 
but the king waved his arm severely and men and 
women with bare legs came in from both sides and 
began dancing all together then the played very and merrily 
and one of the women with thick bare legs and 
thin arms from the others went behind the wings adjusted 
her bodice returned to the middle of the and began 
and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the 
everyone and shouted  then one of the men went 
into a corner of the the and in the struck 
up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped 
very high and waved his feet about very rapidly  
was who received thousand rubles a year for this art 
everybody in the and began and shouting with all their 
might and the man stopped and began smiling and to 
all sides then other men and women danced with bare 
legs then the king again shouted to the sound of 
music and they all began but suddenly a came on 
and were heard in the everyone ran off again one 
of their number away and the dropped once more there 
was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience and 
with rapturous faces everyone began shouting  natasha no longer 
thought this strange she looked about with pleasure smiling joyfully 
  delightful helene asked her   yes replied 
natasha      chapter x   
during the a of cold air came into helene box 
the door opened and anatole entered and trying not to 
against anyone   me introduce my brother to you 
said helene her eyes uneasily from natasha to anatole  
natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young 
officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole 
who was as handsome at close as at a distance 
sat down beside her and told her he had long 
wished to have this happiness since the ball in fact 
at which he had had the well pleasure of seeing 
her kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women 
than among men he talked boldly and naturally and natasha 
was and agreeably struck by the fact that there was 
nothing in this man about whom there was so much 
talk but that on the contrary his smile was most 
naive cheerful and good  kuragin asked her opinion of 
the and told her how at a previous had down 
on the   do you know countess he said 
suddenly addressing her as an old familiar acquaintance  are 
getting up a you ought to take part in it 
it will be great fun we shall all meet at 
the please come no really eh said he  while 
saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her 
face her neck and her bare arms natasha knew for 
certain that he was enraptured by her this pleased her 
yet his presence made her feel and when she was 
not looking at him she felt that he was looking 
at her shoulders and she caught his eye so that 
he should look into hers rather than this but looking 
into his eyes she was frightened that there was not 
that of she had always felt between herself and other 
men she did not know how it was that within 
five minutes she had come to feel herself near to 
this man when she turned away she feared he might 
seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss 
her on the neck they spoke of most ordinary things 
yet she felt that they were closer to one another 
than she had ever been to any man natasha kept 
turning to helene and to her father as if asking 
what it all meant but helene was engaged in conversation 
with a general and did not answer her look and 
her father eyes said nothing but what they always said 
 a good time well i glad of it  
during one of these moments of awkward silence when anatole 
prominent eyes were gazing and fixedly at her natasha to 
break the silence asked him how he liked moscow she 
asked the question and blushed she felt all the time 
that by talking to him she was doing something anatole 
smiled as though to her   first i did 
not like it much because what makes a town pleasant 
 isn that so but now i like it very 
much indeed he said looking at her significantly  come 
to the countess do come and putting out his hand 
to her and dropping his voice he added  will 
be the there do come dear countess and give me 
this flower as a       
 are the pretty women   natasha did not 
understand what he was saying any more than he did 
himself but she felt that his words had an intention 
she did not know what to say and turned away 
as if she had not heard his remark but as 
soon as she had turned away she felt that he 
was there behind so close behind her   is 
he now confused angry ought i to put it right 
she asked herself and she could not refrain from turning 
round she looked straight into his eyes and his self 
and the good tenderness of his smile her she smiled 
just as he was doing gazing straight into his eyes 
and again she felt with horror that no lay between 
him and her  the rose again anatole left the 
box serene and gay natasha went back to her father 
in the other box now quite to the world she 
found herself in all that was going on before her 
now seemed quite natural but on the other hand all 
her previous thoughts of her of princess mary or of 
life in the country did not once to her mind 
and were as if belonging to a past  in 
the fourth act there was some sort of devil who 
sang his arm about till the were from under him 
and he down below that was the only part of 
the fourth act that natasha saw she felt agitated and 
tormented and the cause of this was kuragin whom she 
could not help watching as they were leaving the anatole 
came up to them called their carriage and helped them 
in as he was putting natasha in he pressed her 
arm above the elbow agitated and flushed she turned round 
he was looking at her with eyes smiling tenderly  
 only after she had reached home was natasha able 
clearly to think over what had happened to her and 
suddenly prince andrew she was and at tea to which 
all had sat down after the she gave a loud 
flushed and ran out of the room   god 
i am lost she said to herself  could i 
let him she sat for a long time hiding her 
flushed face in her hands trying to what had happened 
to her but was unable either to understand what had 
happened or what she felt everything seemed dark and terrible 
there in that enormous where the bare in a jacket 
jumped about to the music on and young girls and 
old men and the nearly helene with her proud calm 
smile cried  in the presence of that helene it 
had all seemed clear and simple but now alone by 
herself it was  is it what was that i 
felt of him what is this of conscience i am 
feeling now she thought  only to the old countess 
at night in bed could natasha have told all she 
was feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and 
simple views would either not understand it at all or 
would be at such a so natasha tried to solve 
what was her by herself   i spoiled for 
andrew love or not she asked herself and with irony 
replied  a fool i am to ask that what 
did happen to me nothing i have done nothing i 
didn lead him on at all will know and i 
shall never see him again she told herself  it 
is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing 
to of and andrew can love me still but why 
 o god why isn he here natasha herself for 
a moment but again some told her that though all 
this was true and though nothing had happened yet the 
former of her love for prince andrew had perished and 
again in she went over her whole conversation with kuragin 
and again saw the face gestures and tender smile of 
that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm  
    chapter xi   anatole kuragin 
was staying in moscow because his father had sent him 
away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand 
rubles a year in besides running up for as much 
more which his demanded from his father  his father 
announced to him that he would now pay half his 
for the last time but only on condition that he 
went to moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief 
post his father had for him would at last try 
to make a good match there he indicated to him 
princess mary and julie karagina  anatole and went to 
moscow where he put up at pierre house pierre received 
him at first but got used to him after a 
while sometimes even accompanied him on his and gave him 
money under the of  as shinshin had remarked from 
the time of his arrival anatole had turned the heads 
of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that he 
them and plainly the girls and french actresses the chief 
of whom mademoiselle george he was said to be on 
intimate relations he had never a at or other moscow 
drank whole through everyone else and was at all the 
balls and parties of the best society there was talk 
of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he 
with a few of them at the balls but he 
did not run after the unmarried girls especially the rich 
who were most of them plain there was a special 
reason for this as he had got married two years 
before fact known only to his most intimate friends at 
that time while with his regiment in a of small 
means had forced him to marry his daughter anatole had 
very soon his wife and for a which he agreed 
to send to his father had arranged to be free 
to pass himself off as a bachelor  anatole was 
always with his position with himself and with others he 
was and thoroughly convinced that it was impossible for him 
to live than as he did and that he had 
never in his life done anything base he was incapable 
of considering how his actions might others or what the 
of this or that of his might be he was 
convinced that as a is so made that it must 
live in water so god had made him such that 
he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always 
a prominent position in society he believed this so firmly 
that others looking at him were of it too and 
did not refuse him either a leading place in society 
or money which he from anyone and everyone and evidently 
would not  he was not a gambler at any 
rate he did not care about winning he was not 
vain he did not mind what people thought of him 
still less could he be of more than once he 
had vexed his father by spoiling his own career and 
he laughed at of all kinds he was not mean 
and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all 
he cared about was gaiety and women and as to 
his ideas there was nothing in these and he was 
incapable of considering what the of his for others he 
considered himself sincerely and bad people and with a conscience 
carried his head high  rakes those male have a 
secret feeling of to that which female have on the 
same hope of forgiveness  will be her for she 
loved much and all will be him for he enjoyed 
much  dolokhov who had that year in moscow after 
his exile and his and was leading a life of 
and dissipation with his old petersburg kuragin and made use 
of him for his own  anatole was sincerely fond 
of dolokhov for his and dolokhov who anatole kuragin name 
position and connections as a to draw rich young men 
into his set made use of him and amused himself 
at his without letting the other feel it apart from 
the he from anatole the very process of another will 
was in itself a pleasure a habit and a necessity 
to dolokhov  natasha had made a strong on kuragin 
at supper after the he described to dolokhov with the 
air of a the of her arms shoulders feet and 
hair and expressed his intention of making love to her 
anatole had no and was incapable of considering what might 
come of such love as he never had any of 
the of any of his actions   first my 
dear fellow but not for us replied dolokhov   
will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said 
anatole    better wait till she married  
 know i little girls they lose their heads at 
once anatole   have been caught once already by 
a  girl said dolokhov who knew of kuragin  
care   that can happen twice eh said anatole 
with a good laugh      chapter 
xii   the day after the the rostovs went 
nowhere and came to see them marya dmitrievna talked to 
the count about something which they from natasha natasha guessed 
they were talking about the old prince and planning something 
and this and offended her she was expecting prince andrew 
any moment and twice that day sent a to the 
to whether he had come he had not arrived she 
more now than during her first days in moscow to 
her impatience and for him were now added the unpleasant 
of her interview with princess mary and the old prince 
and a fear and anxiety of which she did not 
understand the cause she continually that either he would never 
come or that something would happen to her before he 
came she could no longer think of him by herself 
and as she had done before as soon as she 
began to think of him the of the old prince 
of princess mary of the and of kuragin mingled with 
her thoughts the question again itself whether she was not 
guilty whether she had not already broken faith with prince 
andrew and again she found herself to the every word 
every gesture and every in the play of expression on 
the face of the man who had been able to 
in her such an and feeling to the family natasha 
seemed than usual but she was far less and happy 
than before  on morning marya dmitrievna her visitors to 
at her of the built over the of of the 
plague   don like those fashionable she said evidently 
herself on her of thought  is the same every 
where we have an excellent he the service and with 
dignity and the is the same what is there in 
giving in the i don like it it just self 
 marya dmitrievna liked and knew how to keep them 
her whole house was and on neither she nor the 
worked and they all wore dress and went to at 
her table there were dishes at dinner and the had 
and roast or but in nothing in the house was 
the so as in marya dmitrievna broad stern face which 
on that day wore an look of solemn  after 
when they had finished their in the dining room where 
the had been removed from the a announced that the 
carriage was ready and marya dmitrievna rose with a stern 
air she wore her shawl in which she paid calls 
and announced that she was going to see prince nicholas 
bolkonski to have an with him about natasha  after 
she had gone a from madame waited on the rostovs 
and natasha very glad of this having herself into a 
room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying on the 
new dresses just as she had put on a bodice 
without sleeves and only together and was turning her head 
to see in the glass how the back she heard 
in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father 
voice and another woman made her it was helene natasha 
had not time to take off the bodice before the 
door opened and countess dressed in a velvet gown with 
a high collar came into the room beaming with good 
amiable smiles   my she cried to the blushing 
natasha  no this is really anything my dear count 
said she to count rostov who had followed her in 
 can you live in moscow and go nowhere no 
i won let you off mademoiselle george will at my 
house tonight and there be some people and if you 
don bring your lovely girls are prettier than mademoiselle george 
won know you my husband is away in or i 
would send him to you you must come you must 
between eight and nine  she nodded to the whom 
she knew and who had respectfully to her and seated 
herself in an armchair beside the looking glass the folds 
of her velvet dress she did not good and gaily 
continually natasha beauty she looked at natasha dresses and them 
as well as a new dress of her own made 
of  which she had received from paris and natasha 
to have one like it   anything suits you 
my she remarked  a smile of pleasure never left 
natasha face she felt happy and as if she were 
under the praise of this dear countess who had seemed 
to her so and important and was now so kind 
to her natasha brightened up and felt almost in love 
with this woman who was so beautiful and so kind 
helene for her part was sincerely delighted with natasha and 
wished to give her a good time anatole had asked 
her to bring him and natasha together and she was 
calling on the rostovs for that purpose the idea of 
her brother and natasha together amused her  though at 
one time in petersburg she had been with natasha for 
drawing boris away she did not think of that now 
and in her own way wished natasha well as she 
was leaving the rostovs she called her aside   
brother with me yesterday nearly died of laughter ate nothing 
and kept sighing for you my he is quite in 
love with you my dear  natasha blushed scarlet when 
she heard this   she how she my pretty 
said helene  must certainly come if you love somebody 
my that is not a reason to yourself up even 
if you are engaged i am sure your would wish 
you to go into society rather than be bored to 
death   she knows i am engaged and she 
and her husband pierre good pierre talked and laughed about 
this so it all right and again under helene influence 
what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural  
she is such a dame so kind and evidently me 
so much and why not enjoy myself thought natasha gazing 
at helene with wide wondering eyes  marya dmitrievna came 
back to dinner and serious having evidently a at the 
old prince she was still too agitated by the to 
be able to talk of the affair in answer to 
the count she replied that things were all right and 
that she would tell about it next day on hearing 
of countess visit and the invitation for that evening marya 
dmitrievna remarked   don care to have anything to 
do with and don advise you to however if you 
promised it will your thoughts she added addressing natasha  
    chapter xiii   count rostov 
took the girls to countess there were a good many 
people there but nearly all to natasha count rostov was 
to see that the company almost entirely of men and 
women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george 
was standing in a corner of the drawing room by 
young men there were several present among them who from 
the time helene reached moscow had been an intimate in 
her house the count decided not to sit down to 
cards or let his girls out of his sight and 
to get away as soon as mademoiselle george was over 
 anatole was at the door evidently on the for 
the rostovs immediately after greeting the count he went up 
to natasha and followed her as soon as she saw 
him she was seized by the same feeling she had 
had at the vanity at his of her and fear 
at the of a between them  helene natasha and 
was loud in of her beauty and her dress soon 
after their arrival mademoiselle george went out of the room 
to change her in the drawing room people began arranging 
the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair 
for natasha and was about to sit down beside her 
but the count who never lost sight of her took 
the seat himself anatole sat down behind her  mademoiselle 
george with her bare fat arms and a red shawl 
over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for 
her and assumed an unnatural enthusiastic was audible  mademoiselle 
george looked sternly and at the audience and began some 
french verses her guilty love for her son in some 
places she raised her voice in others she whispered lifting 
her head sometimes she paused and uttered sounds rolling her 
eyes   was heard from every side  natasha 
looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard 
nor understood anything of what went on before her she 
only felt herself again completely away into this strange world 
from her old world world in which it was impossible 
to know what was good or bad or behind her 
sat anatole and conscious of his she experienced a frightened 
sense of  after the first the whole company rose 
and mademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasm   beautiful she 
is natasha remarked to her father who had also and 
was moving through the crowd toward the actress   
don think so when i look at you said anatole 
following natasha he said this at a moment when she 
alone could hear him  are enchanting from the moment 
i saw you i have never ceased   come 
natasha said the count as he turned back for his 
daughter  beautiful she is natasha without saying anything stepped 
up to her father and looked at him with surprised 
inquiring eyes  after giving several mademoiselle george left and 
countess asked her visitors into the ballroom  the count 
wished to go home but helene him not to spoil 
her ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked natasha 
for a and as they danced he pressed her and 
hand and told her she was and that he loved 
her during the which she also danced with him anatole 
said nothing when they happened to be by themselves but 
merely gazed at her natasha lifted her frightened eyes to 
him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate 
look and smile that she could not looking at him 
say what she had to say she lowered her eyes 
  say such things to me i am and 
love another she said rapidly she glanced at him  
anatole was not upset or by what she had said 
  speak to me of that what can i 
do said he  tell you i am in love 
with you is it my that you are enchanting it 
our turn to begin  natasha animated and looked about 
her with wide frightened eyes and seemed than usual she 
understood hardly anything that went on that evening they danced 
the and the her father asked her to come home 
but she begged to remain wherever she went and she 
was speaking to she felt his eyes upon her later 
on she recalled how she had asked her father to 
let her go to the room to her dress that 
helene had followed her and spoken of her brother love 
and that she again met anatole in the little sitting 
room helene had leaving them alone and anatole had taken 
her hand and said in a tender voice   
cannot come to visit you but is it possible that 
i shall never see you i love you can i 
never and blocking her path he brought his face close 
to hers  his large masculine eyes were so close 
to hers that she saw nothing but them   
he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being pressed 
   don understand i have nothing to say 
her eyes replied  burning lips were pressed to hers 
and at the same instant she felt herself and helene 
footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in 
the room natasha looked round at her and then red 
and threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and 
moved toward the door   word just one for 
god sake cried anatole  she paused she so wanted 
a word from him that would explain to her what 
had happened and to which she could find no answer 
  just a word only one he kept repeating 
evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it 
till helene came up to them  helene returned with 
natasha to the drawing room the rostovs went away without 
staying for supper  after reaching home natasha did not 
sleep all night she was tormented by the question whether 
she loved anatole or prince andrew she loved prince andrew 
remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him but she also 
loved anatole of that there was no doubt  how 
could all this have happened thought she  after that 
i could return his smile when saying good if i 
was able to let it come to that it means 
that i loved him from the first it means that 
he is kind noble and splendid and i could not 
help him what am i to do if i love 
him and the other one too she asked herself unable 
to find an answer to these terrible questions   
   chapter xiv   morning came with 
its cares and everyone got up and began to move 
about and talk came again marya dmitrievna appeared and they 
were called to natasha kept looking uneasily at everybody with 
wide eyes as if wishing to every glance toward her 
and tried to appear the same as usual  after 
which was her best time marya dmitrievna sat down in 
her armchair and called natasha and the count to her 
  friends i have now thought the whole matter 
over and this is my advice she began  as 
you know i went to see prince bolkonski well i 
had a talk with him he took it into his 
head to begin shouting but i am not one to 
be shouted down i said what i had to say 
  and he asked the count   he 
crazy he did not want to listen but what the 
use of talking as it is we have worn the 
poor girl out said marya dmitrievna  advice to you 
is finish your business and go back home to and 
wait there   no exclaimed natasha   go 
back said marya dmitrievna  wait there if your comes 
here now will be no a but alone with the 
old man he will talk things over and then come 
on to you  count rostov of this its if 
the old man came round it would be all the 
better to visit him in moscow or at bald hills 
later on and if not the against his wishes could 
only be arranged at   is perfectly true and 
i am sorry i went to see him and took 
her said the old count   why be sorry 
being here you had to pay your but if he 
won his affair said marya dmitrievna looking for something in 
her reticule  the is ready so there is nothing 
to wait for and what is not ready i send 
after you though i don like letting you go it 
is the best way so go with god  having 
found what she was looking for in the reticule she 
it to natasha it was a letter from princess mary 
  has written to you how she torments herself 
poor thing she afraid you might think that she does 
not like you   she doesn like me said 
natasha   talk nonsense cried marya dmitrievna   
believe anyone i know she doesn like me replied natasha 
boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed 
a cold and angry resolution that marya dmitrievna to look 
at her more and to frown   answer like 
that my good girl she said  i say is 
true write an answer natasha did not reply and went 
to her own room to read princess mary letter  
princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the 
that had occurred between them her father might be she 
begged natasha to believe that she could not help her 
as the one by her brother for whose happiness she 
was ready to sacrifice everything   not think however 
she wrote  my father is ill toward you he 
is an invalid and an old man who must be 
but he is good and and will love her who 
makes his son happy princess mary went on to ask 
natasha to a time when she could see her again 
 after reading the letter natasha sat down at the 
table to answer it  princess she wrote in french 
quickly and and then paused what more could she write 
after all that had happened the evening before  yes 
all that has happened and now all is changed she 
thought as she sat with the letter she had before 
her  i break off with him must i really 
that awful and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she 
went to sonya and began with her  after dinner 
natasha went to her room and again took up princess 
mary letter  it be that it is all over 
she thought  it be that all this has happened 
so quickly and has destroyed all that went before she 
recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former 
strength and at the same time felt that she loved 
kuragin she herself as prince andrew wife and the scenes 
of happiness with him she had so often repeated in 
her and at the same time with excitement recalled every 
of yesterday interview with anatole   could that not 
be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete  
so could i be completely happy but now i have 
to choose and i can be happy without either of 
them only she thought  tell prince andrew what has 
happened or to hide it from him are both impossible 
but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i 
really to forever the joy of prince andrew love in 
which i have lived so long   miss whispered 
a maid entering the room with a air  man 
told me to give you this and she natasha a 
letter   for sake the girl went on as 
natasha without thinking broke the and read a love letter 
from anatole of which without taking in a word she 
understood only that it was a letter from him the 
man she loved yes she loved him or else how 
could that have happened which had happened and how could 
she have a love letter from him in her hand 
 with hands natasha held that passionate love letter which 
dolokhov had for anatole and as she read it she 
found in it an of all that she herself imagined 
she was feeling   yesterday evening my fate has 
been to be loved by you or to die there 
is no other way for me the letter began then 
he went on to say that he knew her parents 
would not give her to him this there were secret 
reasons he could only to her that if she loved 
him she need only say the word yes and no 
human power could their love would conquer all he would 
her away and carry her off to the of the 
earth   yes i love him thought natasha reading 
the letter for the time and finding some peculiarly deep 
meaning in each word of it  that evening marya 
dmitrievna was going to the and to take the girls 
with her natasha a remained at home    
  chapter xv   on returning late in 
the evening sonya went to natasha room and to her 
surprise found her still dressed and on the sofa open 
on the table beside her lay anatole letter sonya picked 
it up and read it  as she read she 
glanced at the natasha trying to find in her face 
an of what she was reading but did not find 
it her face was calm gentle and happy her breast 
to keep herself from sonya pale and with fear and 
agitation sat down in an armchair and burst into tears 
  was it i noticed nothing how could it 
go so far can she have left off prince andrew 
and how could she let kuragin go to such he 
is a and a villain that plain what will nicholas 
dear noble nicholas do when he of it so this 
is the meaning of her resolute unnatural look the day 
before yesterday yesterday and today thought sonya  it can 
be that she him she probably opened the letter without 
knowing who it was from probably she is offended by 
it she could not do such a thing  sonya 
away her tears and went up to natasha again her 
face   she said just  natasha and saw 
sonya   you back  and with the decision 
and tenderness that often come at the moment of she 
embraced her friend but noticing sonya look of embarrassment her 
own face expressed and   you read that letter 
she demanded   answered sonya softly  natasha smiled 
  sonya i can any longer she said  
can hide it from you any longer you know we 
love one another sonya darling he writes sonya  sonya 
stared open at natasha unable to believe her ears  
 bolkonski she asked   sonya if you only 
knew how happy i am cried natasha  don know 
what love is   natasha can that be all 
over  natasha looked at sonya with wide eyes as 
if she could not the question   then are 
you prince andrew said sonya   you don understand 
anything don talk nonsense just listen said natasha with momentary 
vexation   i can believe it sonya  don 
understand how is it you have loved a man for 
a whole year and suddenly why you have only seen 
him three times natasha i don believe you you in 
three days to forget everything and so   days 
said natasha  seems to me i loved him a 
hundred years it seems to me that i have never 
loved anyone before you can understand it sonya wait a 
bit sit here and natasha embraced and kissed her  
 had heard that it happens like this and you 
must have heard it too but it only now that 
i feel such love it not the same as before 
as soon as i saw him i felt he was 
my and i his slave and that i could not 
help him yes his slave he orders i shall do 
you don understand that what can i do what can 
i do sonya cried natasha with a happy yet frightened 
expression   think what you are doing cried sonya 
 can leave it like this this secret how could 
you let him go so far she went on with 
a horror and she could hardly   told you 
that i have no will natasha replied  can you 
understand i love him   i won let it 
come to that i shall tell cried sonya into tears 
  do you mean for god sake if you 
tell you are my declared natasha  want me to 
be you want us to be  when she saw 
natasha sonya tears of shame and pity for her friend 
  what has happened between you she asked  
has he said to you why doesn he come to 
the house  natasha did not answer her questions  
 god sake sonya don tell anyone don torture me 
natasha  no one ought to interfere in such matters 
i have in you   why this why doesn 
he come to the house asked sonya  doesn he 
ask for your hand you know prince andrew gave you 
complete freedom it is really so but i don believe 
it natasha have you considered what these secret reasons can 
be  natasha looked at sonya with evidently this question 
itself to her mind for the first time and she 
did not know how to answer it   don 
know what the reasons are but there must be reasons 
 sonya and shook her head   there were 
reasons she began  but natasha her interrupted her in 
alarm   one can doubt him one can one 
can don you understand she cried   he love 
you   he love me natasha repeated with a 
smile of pity at her friend lack of  you 
have read his letter and you have seen him  
 if he is   if you only knew 
exclaimed natasha   he is an honorable man he 
should either his intentions or seeing you and if you 
won do this i will i will write to him 
and i will tell papa said sonya   i 
can live without him cried natasha   i don

father and of nicholas   don want anyone i 
don love anyone but him how you say he is 
don you know that i love him screamed natasha  
away sonya i don want to with you but go 
for god sake go you see how i am suffering 
natasha cried angrily in a voice of despair and irritation 
sonya burst into and ran from the room  natasha 
went to the table and without a moment wrote that 
answer to princess mary which she had been unable to 
write all the morning in this letter she said that 
all their misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself 
of the magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went 
abroad had given her her freedom she begged princess mary 
to forget everything and forgive her if she had been 
to toward her but that she could not be his 
wife at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple 
and clear to natasha   on the rostovs were 
to return to the country but on wednesday the count 
went with the to his near moscow  on the 
day the count left sonya and natasha were to a 
big dinner party at the and marya dmitrievna took them 
there at that party natasha again met anatole and sonya 
noticed that she spoke to him trying not to be 
and that all through dinner she was more agitated than 
ever when they got home natasha was the first to 
begin the sonya expected   sonya you were talking 
all sorts of nonsense about him natasha began in a 
voice such as children use when they wish to be 
 have had an today   what happened what 
did he say natasha how glad i am you not 
angry with me tell me everything whole truth what did 
he say  natasha became thoughtful   sonya if 
you knew him as i do he said he asked 
me what i had promised bolkonski he was glad i 
was free to refuse him  sonya   you 
haven refused bolkonski said she   i have perhaps 
all is over between me and bolkonski why do you 
think so badly of me   don think anything 
only i don understand this   a bit sonya 
you understand everything you see what a man he is 
now don think badly of me or of him i 
don think badly of anyone i love and pity everybody 
but what am i to do  sonya did not 
to the tender tone natasha used toward her the more 
and ingratiating the expression of natasha face became the more 
serious and stern grew sonya   said she  
asked me not to speak to you and i haven 
spoken but now you yourself have i don him natasha 
why this   again interrupted natasha   i 
am afraid for you   of what   
am afraid you going to your said sonya and was 
herself at what she had said  anger again showed 
in natasha face   i go to my i 
will as soon as possible it not your business it 
won be you but i who suffer leave me alone 
leave me alone i hate you   sonya  
 hate you i hate you you my forever and 
natasha ran out of the room  natasha did not 
speak to sonya again and her with the same expression 
of agitated surprise and she went about the house taking 
up now one occupation now another and at once them 
 hard as it was for sonya she watched her 
friend and did not let her out of her sight 
 the day before the count was to return sonya 
noticed that natasha sat by the drawing window all the 
morning as if expecting something and that she made a 
sign to an officer who drove past whom sonya took 
to be anatole  sonya began watching her friend still 
more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that 
evening natasha was in a strange and unnatural state she 
answered questions at random began sentences she did not finish 
and laughed at everything  after tea sonya noticed a 
at natasha door timidly waiting to let her pass she 
let the girl go in and then listening at the 
door learned that another letter had been delivered  then 
suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some 
dreadful plan for that evening sonya at her door natasha 
did not let her in   will run away 
with him thought sonya  is capable of anything there 
was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today 
she cried as she said good to uncle sonya remembered 
 that it she means to with him but what 
am i to do thought she all the signs that 
clearly indicated that natasha had some terrible intention  count 
is away what am i to do write to kuragin 
an but what is there to him to reply write 
to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case 
of some but perhaps she really has already refused bolkonski 
sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is 
away to tell marya dmitrievna who had such faith in 
natasha seemed to sonya terrible  thought sonya as she 
stood in the dark passage  or never i must 
prove that i remember the family goodness to me and 
that i love nicholas yes if i don sleep for 
three i not leave this passage and will hold her 
back by force and will and not let the family 
be thought she      chapter xvi 
  anatole had lately moved to dolokhov the plan 
for rostova had been arranged and the made by dolokhov 
a few days before and on the day that sonya 
after listening at natasha door to her it was to

and looking straight before him with a smile that did 
not leave his face  dolokhov down the of his 
and turned to anatole with an smile   you

  anatole  talk nonsense if you only knew

contemptuously and when anatole had gone out   wait 
a bit he called after him  not i talking

at dolokhov trying to give him his attention and evidently 
to him   listen to me i telling you

that so and don talk to me don don

a mess   to the devil cried anatole and 
his hair left the room but returned at once and 
dropped into an armchair in front of dolokhov with his 
feet turned under him  the very devil what feel 
how it he took dolokhov hand and put it on 
his heart  a foot my dear fellow what a 
glance a he added in french   dolokhov with 
a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent 
eyes looked at him wishing to get some more out 
of him   and when the money gone what 
then   then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by 
a thought of the future  then then i don 
know but why talk nonsense he glanced at his watch 
 time  anatole went into the back room  
 then nearly ready you he shouted to the  
dolokhov put away the money called a footman whom he 
ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink 
before the and went into the room where and were

muttered tenderly to himself   and eat something have

side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked 
in a mirror and standing before dolokhov in the same 
he had assumed before it he lifted a glass of 
wine   good thank you for everything and said 
anatole  comrades and friends he considered for a moment

what is it sonya why go away  and she 
burst into with the with which people they feel they 
have themselves marya dmitrievna was to speak again but natasha 
cried out   away go away you all hate 
and me and she threw herself back on the sofa 
 marya dmitrievna went on her for some time on 
her that it must all be kept from her father 
and her that would know anything about it if only 
natasha herself would to forget it all and not let 
anyone see that something had happened natasha did not reply 
nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold 
and had a fit marya dmitrievna put a under her 
head covered her with two and herself brought her some 
water but natasha did not to her   let 
her sleep said marya dmitrievna as she went out of 
the room natasha to be  but natasha was not 
with pale face and fixed wide eyes she looked straight 
before her all that night she did not sleep or 
and did not speak to sonya who got up and 
went to her several times  next day count rostov 
returned from his near moscow in time for as he 
had promised he was in very good the affair with 
the was going on and there was nothing to keep 
him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom 
he marya dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha 
had been very the day before and that they had 
sent for the doctor but that she was better now 
natasha had not left her room that morning with compressed 
and lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the 
window uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly 
glancing round at anyone who entered the room she was 
evidently expecting news of him and that he would come 
or would write to her  when the count came 
to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound 
of a man and then her face resumed its cold 
and expression she did not even get up to him 
 is the matter with you my are you ill 
asked the count  after a moment silence natasha answered 
 ill  in reply to the count anxious as 
to why she was so and whether anything had happened 
to her she him that nothing had happened and asked 
him not to marya dmitrievna natasha that nothing had happened 
from the pretense of illness from his daughter distress and 
by the faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna the count 
saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his but 
it was so terrible for him to think that anything 
had happened to his daughter and he so his own 
cheerful that he and tried to assure himself that nothing 
particularly had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her 
their return to the country      
chapter xix   from the day his wife arrived 
in moscow pierre had been intending to go away somewhere 
so as not to be near her soon after the 
rostovs came to moscow the effect natasha had on him 
made him to carry out his intention he went to 
to see widow who had long since promised to hand 
over to him some papers of her husband  when 
he returned to moscow pierre was a letter from marya 
dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a 
matter of great importance to andrew bolkonski and his pierre 
had been natasha because it seemed to him that his 
feeling for her was than a married man should be 
for his friend yet some fate constantly threw them together 
  can have happened and what can they want 
with me thought he as he dressed to go to 
marya dmitrievna  only prince andrew would up and come 
and marry her thought he on his way to the 
house  on the a familiar voice called to him 
  been back long someone shouted pierre raised his 
head in a drawn by two gray that were the 
with snow anatole and his constant companion dashed past anatole 
was sitting upright in the classic of military the lower 
part of his face by his collar and his head 
slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his white 
hat to one side his and hair with snow  
 indeed that a true thought pierre  nothing the 
pleasure of the moment nothing him and so he is 
always cheerful satisfied and serene what i give to be 
like him he thought  in marya dmitrievna anteroom the 
footman who helped him off with his coat said that 
the asked him to come to her  when he 
opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the 
window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced 
round at him frowned and left the room with an 
expression of cold dignity   has happened asked pierre 
entering marya dmitrievna room   answered dmitrievna  fifty 
years have i lived in this world and never known 
anything so  and having put him on his honor 
not to anything she told him marya dmitrievna him that 
natasha had refused prince andrew without her parents knowledge and 
that the cause of this was anatole kuragin into whose 
society pierre wife had thrown her and with whom natasha 
had tried to during her father in order to be 
married secretly  pierre raised his shoulders and listened open 
to what was told him scarcely able to believe his 
own ears that prince andrew deeply loved wife same natasha 
rostova who used to be so charming give up bolkonski 
for that fool anatole who was already secretly married  
pierre knew and should be so in love with him 
as to agree to run away with him was something 
pierre could not and could not imagine  he could 
not the charming he had of natasha whom he had 
known from a child with this new of her folly 
and he thought of his wife  are all alike 
he said to himself reflecting that he was not the 
only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad 
woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point 
of tears and with his pride and the more he 
pitied his friend the more did he think with and 
even with of that natasha who had just passed him 
in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity 
he did not know that natasha soul was with despair 
shame and humiliation and that it was not her that 
her face happened to an expression of calm dignity and 
severity   how get married said pierre in answer 
to marya dmitrievna  could not marry is married  
 get worse from hour to hour marya dmitrievna  
nice youth what a and she expecting him him since 
yesterday she must be told then at least she won 
go on expecting him  after hearing the of anatole 
from pierre and giving to her anger against anatole in 
words of marya dmitrievna told pierre why she had sent 
for him she was afraid that the count or bolkonski 
who might arrive at any moment if they knew of 
this affair  she to hide from them might challenge 
anatole to a and she therefore asked pierre to tell 
his brother in her name to leave moscow and not 
to let her set eyes on him again pierre now 
the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrew 
to do as she wished having and exactly explained her 
wishes to him she let him go to the drawing 
room   the count knows nothing behave as if 
you know nothing either she said  i will go 
and tell her it is no use expecting him and 
stay to dinner if you care to she called after 
pierre  pierre met the old count who seemed nervous 
and upset that morning natasha had told him that she 
had bolkonski   my dear fellow he said to 
pierre  one has with these girls without their mother 
i do so regret having come here i will be 
frank with you have you heard she has broken off 
her without anybody it true this never was much to 
my of course he is an excellent man but still 
with his father they have been happy and natasha won 
lack still it has been going on so long and 
to take such a step without father or mother consent 
and now she ill and god knows what it hard 
count hard to manage daughters in their mother  pierre 
saw that the count was much upset and tried to 
change the subject but the count returned to his  
sonya entered the room with an agitated face   
is not quite well she in her room and would 
like to see you marya dmitrievna is with her and 
she too asks you to come   you are 
a great friend of bolkonski no doubt she wants to 
send him a said the count  dear oh dear 
how happy it all was  and the spare gray 
locks on his the count left the room  when 
marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married natasha did 
not wish to believe it and on having it by 
pierre himself sonya told pierre this as she led him 
along the to natasha room  natasha pale and stern 
was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and her eyes met pierre 
with a look the moment he entered she did not 
smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at him and 
her look asked only one thing was he a friend 
or like the others an in regard to anatole as 
for pierre he evidently did not exist for her  
 knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to 
pierre and addressing natasha  him tell you whether i 
have told the truth  natasha looked from one to 
the other as a and animal looks at the approaching 
dogs and   ilynichna pierre began dropping his eyes 
with a feeling of pity for her and for the 
thing he had to do  it is true or 
not should make no difference to you because   
it is not true that he married   it 
is true   he been married long she asked 
 your honor  pierre gave his word of honor 
  he still here she asked quickly   
i have just seen him  she was evidently unable 
to speak and made a sign with her hands that 
they should leave her alone      
chapter xx   pierre did not stay for dinner 
but left the room and went away at once he 
drove through the town anatole kuragin at the thought of 
whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he 
felt a difficulty in breathing he was not at the 
ice hills nor at the nor at pierre drove to 
the club in the club all was going on as 
usual the members who were for dinner were sitting about 
in groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town 
news the footman having greeted him knowing his and his 
told him there was a place left for him in 
the small dining room and that prince michael was in 
the library but had not yet arrived one of pierre 
while they were talking about the weather asked if he 
had heard of kuragin of rostova which was talked of 
in the town and was it true pierre laughed and 
said it was nonsense for he had just come from 
the rostovs he asked everyone about anatole one man told 
him he had not come yet and another that he 
was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see 
this calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was 
going on in his soul he through the ballroom waited 
till everyone had come and as anatole had not turned 
up did not stay for dinner but drove home  
anatole for whom pierre was looking that day with dolokhov 
him as to how to this unfortunate affair it seemed 
to him essential to see natasha in the evening he 
drove to his sister to discuss with her how to 
arrange a meeting when pierre returned home after hunting all 
over moscow his him that prince anatole was with the 
countess the countess drawing room was full of guests  
pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen 
since his return that moment she was more to him 
than ever the drawing room and seeing anatole went up 
to him   pierre said the countess going up 
to her husband  don know what a our anatole 
 she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her 
husband head in his eyes and his resolute the terrible 
of that and strength which she knew and had herself 
experienced after his with dolokhov   you are there 
is and said pierre to his wife  come with 
me i must speak to you he added in french 
 anatole glanced round at his sister and rose ready 
to follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled 
him toward himself and was leading him from the room 
  you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered 
helene but pierre did not reply and went out of 
the room  anatole followed him with his usual step 
but his face anxiety  having entered his study pierre 
closed the door and addressed anatole without looking at him 
  promised countess rostova to marry her and were 
about to with her is that so   cher 
answered anatole  whole conversation was in french  don 
consider myself to answer questions put to me in that 
tone  pierre face already pale became distorted by he 
seized anatole by the collar of his uniform with his 
big hand and shook him from side to side till 
anatole face showed a sufficient degree of   i 
tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre 
  now this is stupid what said anatole a 
of his collar that had been wrenched with a bit 
of the   a and a and i don 
know what deprives me from the pleasure of your head 
with this said pierre expressing himself so because he was 
talking french  he took a heavy and lifted it 
threateningly but at once put it back in its place 
  you promise to marry her   i 
didn think of it i never promised because  pierre 
interrupted him   you any of hers any he 
said moving toward anatole  anatole glanced at him and 
immediately thrust his hand into his and drew out his 
pocketbook  pierre took the letter anatole him and pushing 
aside a table that stood in his way threw himself 
on the sofa   be don be afraid said 
pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of anatole  
the said he as if repeating a to himself  
he continued after a short pause again rising and again 
pacing the room  you must get out of moscow 
  how can i   pierre continued without 
listening to him  must never breathe a word of 
what has passed between you and countess rostova i know 
i can prevent your doing so but if you have 
a of conscience pierre the room several times in silence 
 anatole sat at a table frowning and his lips 
  all you must understand that besides your pleasure 
there is such a thing as other people happiness and 
peace and that you are a whole life for the 
sake of amusing yourself yourself with women like my wife 
them you are within your rights for they know what 
you want of them they are against you by the 
same experience of debauchery but to promise a maid to 
marry her to to don you understand that it is 
as mean as an old man or a child  
pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an 
angry but with a look   don know about 
that eh said anatole growing more confident as pierre his 
 don know that and don want to he said 
not looking at pierre and with a slight of his 
lower  you have used such words to me and 
so on as a man of honor i can allow 
anyone to use  pierre glanced at him with amazement 
unable to understand what he wanted   it was 
tete anatole continued  i can   it satisfaction 
you want said pierre ironically   could at least 
take back your words what if you want me to 
do as you wish eh   take them back 
i take them back said pierre  i ask you 
to forgive me pierre glanced at the  if you 
money for your  anatole smiled the expression of that 
base and smile which pierre knew so well in his 
wife him   and heartless he exclaimed and left 
the room  next day anatole left for petersburg  
    chapter   pierre drove to 
marya dmitrievna to tell her of the fulfillment of her 
wish that kuragin should be from moscow the whole house 
was in a state of alarm and commotion natasha was 
very ill having as marya dmitrievna told him in secret 
herself the night after she had been told that anatole 
was married with some she had after swallowing a little 
she had been so frightened that she sonya and told 
her what she had done the necessary had been in 
time and she was now out of danger though still 
so weak that it was out of the question to 
move her to the country and so the countess had 
been sent for pierre saw the count and sonya who 
had a tear face but he could not see natasha 
 pierre at the club that day and heard on 
all sides gossip about the of rostova he these everyone 
that nothing had happened except that his brother had to 
her and been refused it seemed to pierre that it 
was his duty to the whole affair and natasha reputation 
 he was awaiting prince andrew return with and went 
every day to the old prince for news of him 
 old prince bolkonski heard all the current in the 
town from mademoiselle and had read the note to princess 
mary in which natasha had broken off her he seemed 
in better than usual and his son with great impatience 
 some days after anatole pierre received a note from 
prince andrew him of his arrival and asking him to 
come to see him  as soon as he reached 
moscow prince andrew had received from his father natasha note 
to princess mary breaking off her  had it from 
princess mary and given it to the old prince and 
he heard from him the story of natasha with  
prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came 
to see him next morning pierre expected to find prince 
andrew in almost the same state as natasha and was 
therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him 
in the study talking in a loud animated voice about 
some going on in petersburg the old prince voice and 
another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out 
to meet pierre she looking toward the door of the 
room where prince andrew was evidently intending to express her 
sympathy with his sorrow but pierre saw by her face 
that she was glad both at what had happened and 
at the way her brother had taken the news of 
natasha   says he expected it she remarked  
know his pride will not let him express his but 
still he has taken it better far better than i 
expected evidently it had to be   is it 
possible that all is really ended asked pierre  princess 
mary looked at him with she did not understand how 
he could ask such a question pierre went into the 
study prince andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health 
but with a fresh between his brows stood in civilian 
dress facing his father and prince warmly and gesticulating the 
conversation was about news of whose exile and had just 
reached moscow   he is and by all who 
were enthusiastic about him a month ago prince andrew was 
saying  by those who were unable to understand his 
to judge a man who is in and to throw 
on him all the of other men is very easy 
but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished 
in this it was done by him by him alone 
 he paused at the sight of pierre his face 
quivered and immediately assumed a expression   will do 
him he concluded and at once turned to pierre  
 how are you still getting he said with animation 
but the new on his forehead  i am well 
he said in answer to pierre question and smiled  
to pierre that smile said plainly  am well but 
my health is now of no use to anyone  
after a few words to pierre about the awful from 
the about people he had met in who knew pierre 
and about whom he had brought from abroad to be 
his son tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the 
conversation about which was still going on between the two 
old men   there were or of secret relations 
with napoleon they would have been made public he said 
with and  do not and never did like personally 
but i like  pierre now recognized in his friend 
a need with which he was only too familiar to 
get and to have about matters in order to thoughts 
that were too and too intimate when prince had left 
prince andrew took pierre arm and asked him into the 
room that had been assigned him a bed had been 
made up there and some open and stood about prince 
andrew went to one and took out a small from 
which he drew a wrapped in paper he did it 
all silently and very quickly he stood up and his 
face was gloomy and his lips compressed   me 
for you  pierre saw that prince andrew was going 
to speak of natasha and his broad face expressed pity 
and sympathy this expression prince andrew and in a determined 
ringing and unpleasant tone he continued   have received 
a from countess rostova and have heard reports of your 
brother having her hand or something of that kind is 
that true   true and pierre began but prince 
andrew interrupted him   are her and her portrait 
said he  he took the from the table and 
it to pierre   this to the countess if 
you see her   is very ill said pierre 
  she is here still said prince andrew  
prince kuragin he added quickly   left long ago 
she has been at death door   much regret 
her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his 
father coldly and   monsieur kuragin has not countess 
rostova with his hand said prince andrew and he several 
times   could not marry for he was married 
already said pierre  prince andrew laughed again one of 
his father   where is your brother now if 
i may ask he said   has gone to 
but i don know said pierre   it doesn 
matter said prince andrew  countess rostova that she was 
and is perfectly free and that i wish her all 
that is good  pierre took the prince andrew as 
if trying to remember whether he had something more to 
say or waiting to see if pierre would say anything 
looked fixedly at him   say do you remember 
our in petersburg asked pierre    returned prince 
andrew hastily  said that a woman should be but 
i didn say i could forgive her i can  
 can this be said pierre  prince andrew interrupted 
him and cried  ask her hand again be and 
so on yes that would be very noble but i 
am unable to follow in that footsteps if you wish 
to be my friend never speak to me of that 
of all that well good so you give her the 
 pierre left the room and went to the old 
prince and princess mary  the old man seemed than 
usual princess mary was the same as always but beneath 
her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her satisfaction that 
the had been broken off looking at them pierre realized 
what and they all felt for the rostovs and that 
it was impossible in their presence even to mention the 
name of her who could give up prince andrew for 
anyone else  at dinner the talk turned on the 
war the of which was becoming evident prince andrew talked 
arguing now with his father now with the tutor and 
showing an unnatural animation the cause of which pierre so 
well understood      chapter   
that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to fulfill 
the to him natasha was in bed the count at 
the club and pierre after giving the to sonya went 
to marya dmitrievna who was interested to know how prince 
andrew had taken the news ten minutes later sonya came 
to marya dmitrievna   on seeing count peter said 
she   how are we to take him up 
to her the room there has not been up  
 she has dressed and gone into the drawing room 
said sonya  marya dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders  
 will her mother come she has me to death 
now mind don tell her everything said she to pierre 
 hasn the heart to her she is so much 
to be pitied so much to be pitied  natasha 
was standing in the middle of the drawing room with 
a pale set face but not at all as pierre 
expected to find her when he appeared at the door 
she grew flurried evidently whether to go to meet him 
or to wait till he came up  pierre hastened 
to her he thought she would give him her hand 
as usual but she up to him stopped breathing heavily 
her arms hanging just in the she used to stand 
in when she went to the middle of the ballroom 
to sing but with quite a different expression of face 
  she began rapidly  bolkonski was your friend 
your friend she herself  seemed to her that everything 
that had once been must now be different  told 
me once to apply to you  pierre as he 
looked at her but did not speak till then he 
had her in his heart and tried to her but 
he now felt so sorry for her that there was 
no room in his soul for reproach   is 
here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped 
and still more quickly but did not tears   
i will tell him answered pierre   he did 
not know what to say  natasha was evidently at 
the thought of what he might think she had meant 
  i know all is over she said hurriedly 
 that can never be i only tormented by the 
wrong i have done him tell him only that i 
beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything  
she trembled all over and sat down on a chair 
 a sense of pity he had never before known 
overflowed pierre heart   will tell him i will 
tell him everything once more said pierre  i should 
like to know one thing   what natasha eyes 
asked   should like to know did you love 
pierre did not know how to to anatole and flushed 
at the thought of him you love that bad man 
  call him bad said natasha  i don 
know don know at all  she began to cry 
and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love 
up in pierre he felt the tears under his spectacles 
and they would not be noticed   won speak 
of it any more my dear said pierre and his 
gentle tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha   
won speak of it my dear tell him everything but 
one thing i beg of you consider me your friend 
and if you want help advice or simply to open 
your heart to someone now but when your mind is 
think of me he took her hand and kissed it 
 shall be happy if it in my power  
pierre grew confused   speak to me like that 
i am not worth it exclaimed natasha and turned to 
leave the room but pierre held her hand  he 
knew he had something more to say to her but 
when he said it he was at his own words 
  stop you have your whole life before you 
said he to her   me no all is 
over for me she replied with shame and self  
  over he repeated  i were not myself 
but the and best man in the world and were 
free i would this moment ask on my knees for 
your hand and your love  for the first time 
for many days natasha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness 
and glancing at pierre she went out of the room 
 pierre too when she had gone almost ran into 
the anteroom restraining tears of tenderness and joy that him 
and without finding the sleeves of his cloak threw it 
on and got into his   to now your 
excellency asked the   to pierre asked himself  
can i go now not to the club or to 
pay calls all men seemed so so poor in with 
this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in with 
that grateful last look she had given him through her 
tears   said pierre and despite twenty of he 
threw open the cloak from his broad chest and inhaled 
the air with joy  it was clear and above 
the dirty ill above the black the dark sky only 
looking up at the sky did pierre to feel how 
and humiliating were all things with the to which his 
soul had just been raised at the entrance to the 
square an immense of dark sky itself to his eyes 
almost in the center of it above the and on 
all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by 
its to the earth its white light and its long 
tail shone the enormous and brilliant of  which was 
said to all kinds of and the end of the 
world in pierre however that with its long tail no 
feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed joyfully his 
eyes with tears at this bright which having in its 
with through space seemed suddenly an piercing the earth remain 
fixed in a spot holding its tail erect shining and 
displaying its white light amid other stars it seemed to 
pierre that this fully to what was passing in his 
own and soul now into a new life   
   book nine      
 chapter i   from the close of the 
year  and of the forces of europe began and 
in  these forces of men those and the army 
from the west to the russian toward which since  
russian forces had been drawn on the of  the 
forces of europe the russian and war began that is 
an took place to human reason and to human nature 
millions of men perpetrated against one another such of money 
and as in whole are not in the of all 
the law of the world but which those who committed 
them did not at the time regard as being  
what produced this extraordinary what were its causes the tell 
us with naive assurance that its causes were the on 
the of the of the system the of napoleon the 
of alexander the of the and so on  it 
would only have been necessary for rumyantsev or between a 
and an evening party to have taken proper and written 
a more note or for napoleon to have written to 
alexander  respected brother i consent to restore the to 
the of there would have been no war  we 
can understand that the matter seemed like that to it 
naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was by england 
intrigues  in fact he said on the island of 
st it naturally seemed to members of the english that 
the cause of the war was napoleon to the of 
that the cause of the war was the violence done 
to him to that the cause of the war was 
the system which was europe to the and old soldiers 
that the chief reason for the war was the necessity 
of giving them to the of that day that it 
was the need of and to the of that time 
that it all from the fact that the alliance between 
russia and austria in  had not been well from 
napoleon and from the awkward of no  it is 
natural that these and a and of other reasons the 
number on the of of themselves to the men of 
that day but to us to who the thing that 
happened in all its and its plain and terrible meaning 
these causes seem to us it is that millions of 
christian men killed and each other either because napoleon was 
or alexander was firm or because england was or the 
of we cannot what connection such circumstances have with the 
fact of and violence why because the was thousands of 
men from the other side of europe killed and the 
people of and moscow and were killed by them  
to us their who are not and are not carried 
away by the process of and can therefore regard the 
with common sense an number of causes present themselves the 
deeper we in search of these causes the more of 
them we find and each separate cause or whole of 
causes to us in itself and by its to the 
of the and by its from the of all the 
other causes occasion the to us the wish or of 
this or that french to serve a second as much 
a cause as napoleon to his the and to restore 
the of for had he not wished to serve and 
had a second a third and a and private also 
refused there would have been so many less men in 
napoleon army and the war could not have occurred  
had napoleon not taken at the demand that he should 
the and not ordered his to there would have been 
no war but had all his to serving a second 
then also there could have been no war nor could 
there have been a war had there been no english 
intrigues and no of and had alexander not felt and 
had there not been an government in russia or a 
revolution in france and a and empire or all the 
things that produced the french revolution and so on without 
each of these causes nothing could have happened so all 
these causes of causes to bring it about and so 
there was no one cause for that but it had 
to occur because it had to millions of men their 
human and reason had to go from west to east 
to their fellows just as some of men had come 
from the east to the west their fellows  the 
actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the seemed 
to were as little as the actions of any who 
was drawn into the by lot or by this could 
not be for in order that the will of napoleon 
and alexander  whom the seemed to should be carried 
out the of circumstances was without any one of which 
the could not have taken place it was necessary that 
millions of men in whose hands lay the real power 
soldiers who or and consent to carry out the will 
of these weak and should have been to do so 
by an number of and causes  we are forced 
to fall back on as an of  is to 
say the of which we do not understand the more 
we try to explain such in history the more and 
do they become to us  each man lives for 
himself using his freedom to his and with his whole 
being that he can now do or from doing this 
or that but as soon as he has done it 
that performed at a certain moment in time irrevocable and 
belongs to history in which it has not a free 
but a  there are two sides to the life 
of every man his life which is the more free 
the more abstract its interests and his life in which 
he laid down for him  man lives for himself 
but is an instrument in the attainment of the of 
a deed done is irrevocable and its result in time 
with the actions of millions of other men an the 
higher a man on the social the more people he 
is connected with and the more power he has over 
others the more evident is the and of his every 
  king heart is in the hands of the 
 a king is history slave  history that is 
the general life of mankind every moment of the life 
of as a for its own  though napoleon at 
that time in  was more convinced than ever that 
it on him  le sang de  alexander expressed 
it in the last letter he wrote him had never 
been so much in the of which compelled him while 
thinking that he was on his own to perform for 
the life is to say for history had to be 
performed          
not to the blood of his   the people 
of the west moved to their fellow men and by 
the law of thousands of minute causes in and to 
produce that movement and war for the of the system 
the of the movement of into prussia  it seemed 
to napoleon only for the purpose of an peace the 
french emperor love and habit of war with his people 
by the of the and the on those and the 
need of advantages to for that the he received in 
the which in the opinion of were carried on with 
a sincere desire to peace but which only the self 
of both sides and millions of other causes that themselves 
to the that was or with it  when an 
has and why does it fall because of its to 
the earth because its because it is by the sun 
because it because the wind it or because the boy 
standing below wants to eat it  nothing is the 
cause all this is only the of in which all 
and occur and the who finds that the because the 
and so is right with the child who under the 
tree and says the fell because he wanted to eat 
it and for it right or wrong is he who 
says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to 
and perished because alexander desired his and he who says 
that an hill a million fell because the last struck 
it for the last time with his in the so 
great men are giving to and like they have but 
the connection with the itself  every act of which 
to them an act of their own will is in 
an sense involuntary and is related to the whole course 
of history and from      chapter 
ii   on the twenty of may napoleon left 
where he had spent three by a court that and 
even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the 
emperor and who had deserved it the and with whom 
he was dissatisfied and diamonds of his own is which 
he had taken from other the empress of austria and 
having as his tells us tenderly embraced the empress regarded 
him as her husband though he had left another wife 
in paris her by the which she seemed hardly able 
to bear though the still firmly believed in the of 
peace and worked to that end and though the emperor 
napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him monsieur 
mon and sincerely him that he did not want war 
and would always love and honor him he set off 
to join his army and at every gave fresh orders 
to the movement of his from west to east he 
went in a with six horses by and an along 
the road to and at each of these thousands of 
people met him with excitement and enthusiasm  the army 
was moving from west to east and relays of six 
horses carried him in the same direction on the tenth 
of  coming up with the army he spent the 
night in apartments prepared for him on the of a 
count in the forest       
 old style   next day the army he 
went in a carriage to the and changing into a 
uniform he drove to the in order to a place 
for the crossing  seeing on the other side some 
 and the wide in the midst of which lay 
the city of moscow  la the capital of a 
such as the into which alexander the great had unexpectedly 
and contrary alike to and ordered an and the next 
day his army began to cross the  early in 
the morning of the of he came out of his 
which was that day on the left bank of the 
and looked through a at the of his out of 
the forest and over the three thrown across the river 
the knowing of the emperor presence were on the for 
him and when they caught sight of a figure in 
an and a hat standing apart from his in front 
of his on the hill they threw up their and 
shouted  l and one after another in a stream 
out of the forest that had them and on and 
on by the three to the other side   
we go into oh when he takes it in hand 
himself things get hot by heaven there he is l 
so these are the of it a country all the 
same au revoir i keep the best in moscow for 
you au revoir good luck did you see the emperor 
l they make me of i make you of settled 
l the how they run l there he is do 
you see him i seen him twice as i see 
you now the little i saw him give the cross 
to one of the l came the voices of men 
old and young of most and social positions on the 
faces of all was one common expression of joy at 
the of the long and of and devotion to the 
man in the gray coat who was standing on the 
hill  on the of a rather small horse was 
brought to napoleon he it and at a to one 
of the over the continually by and rapturous which he 
evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the 
soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting 
but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and 
him from the military cares that had occupied him from 
the time he joined the army he across one of 
the swaying to the farther side turned to the left 
and in the direction of by enraptured of the who 
with to clear a path for him through the on 
reaching the broad river he stopped near a regiment of 
by the river   shouted the breaking their ranks 
and pressing against one another to see him  napoleon 
looked up and down the river and sat down on 
a that lay on the bank at a sign from 
him a was him which he rested on the back 
of a happy page who had run up to him 
and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became 
in a map laid out on the without lifting his 
head he said something and two of his off to 
the   what did he say was heard in 
the ranks of the when one of the up to 
them  the order was to find a and to 
cross the river the colonel of the a handsome old 
man flushed and in his speech from excitement asked the 
aide whether he would be to swim the river with 
his instead of a in evident fear of like a 
boy asking for to get on a horse he begged 
to be allowed to swim across the river before the 
emperor eyes the aide replied that probably the emperor would 
not be at this of  as soon as the 
aide had said this the old officer with happy face 
and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted  and the 
to follow him his horse and into the river he 
gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown 
under him and into the water for the part where 
the current was of in after him it was cold 
and in the current in the middle of the stream 
and the caught hold of one another as they fell 
off their horses some of the horses were drowned and 
some of the men the others tried to swim on 
some in the and some to their horses they tried 
to make their way forward to the opposite bank and 
though there was a one third of a mile away 
were proud that they were swimming and in this river 
under the eyes of the man who sat on the 
and was not even looking at what they were doing 
when the aide having returned and choosing an moment to 
draw the emperor attention to the devotion of the to 
his person the little man in the gray got up 
and having began pacing up and down the bank with 
him giving him and occasionally glancing at the who his 
attention  for him it was no new conviction that 
his presence in any part of the world from africa 
to the of alike was enough to people and them 
to self he called for his horse and to his 
 some forty were drowned in the river though boats 
were sent to their the back to the bank from 
which they had started the colonel and some of his 
men got across and with difficulty out on the further 
bank and as soon as they had got out in 
their and clothes they shouted  and looked at the 
spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer 
was and at that moment considered themselves happy  that 
evening between one order that the russian paper money prepared 
for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as 
possible and another that a should be on whom a 
letter information about the orders to the french army had 
been found napoleon also gave that the colonel who had 
into the river should be in the d of which 
napoleon was himself the head      
    those whom  wishes to he 
mad      chapter iii   
the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in for more 
than a month and holding nothing was ready for the 
war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the 
emperor had come from petersburg there was no general plan 
of the between the that were had even after the 
emperor had been at for a month each of the 
three had its own commander in chief but there was 
no commander of all the forces and the emperor did 
not that responsibility himself  the longer the emperor remained 
in the less did everybody of waiting for the war 
all the of those who the sovereign seemed merely to 
making him spend his time and forget that war was 
 in after many balls and given by the by 
the and by the emperor himself it occurred to one 
of the in that a dinner and ball should be 
given for the emperor by his this idea was eagerly 
received the emperor gave his consent the money by the 
lady who was thought to be most to the emperor 
was to act as hostess count being a in the 
offered his country house for the fete and the of 
was fixed for a ball dinner and fireworks at count 
country seat  the very day that napoleon the order 
to cross the and his off the the russian alexander 
spent the evening at the entertainment given by his at 
country house  it was a gay and brilliant fete 
of such matters declared that had so many beautiful women 
been assembled in one place countess was present among other 
russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to 
and the refined ladies by her so called russian type 
of beauty the emperor noticed her and her with a 
dance  boris having left his wife in moscow and 
being for the present  he it was also there 
and though not an aide had a large sum toward 
the boris was now a rich man who had to 
high and no longer but stood on an equal footing 
with the highest of those of his own age he 
was meeting helene in after not having seen her for 
a long time and did not the past but as 
helene was the favors of a very important and boris 
had only recently married they met as good friends of 
long standing  at dancing was still going on helene 
not having a partner herself offered to dance the with 
boris they were the third boris looking at helene bare 
shoulders which from a dark gold gown talked to her 
of old and at the same time unaware of it 
himself and by others never for an instant ceased to 
observe the emperor who was in the same room the 
emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping 
now one pair and now another with gracious words which 
he alone knew how to utter  as the began 
boris saw that adjutant general one of those in on 
the emperor went up to him and contrary to court 
stood near him while he was talking to a lady 
having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at 
and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there 
were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the 
lady and turned to him hardly had to speak before 
a look of amazement appeared on the emperor face he 
took by the arm and the room with him a 
path seven wide as the people on both sides made 
way for him boris noticed face when the sovereign went 
out with looked at the emperor from under his and 
with his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as 
if expecting the emperor to him  understood that and 
was that evidently important news had reached the emperor than 
through himself  but the emperor and passed out into 
the garden without noticing who holding his sword and glancing 
around followed some twenty behind them  all the time 
boris was going through the of the he was by 
the question of what news had brought and how he 
could find it out before others in the figure in 
which he had to choose two ladies he whispered to 
helene that he meant to choose countess who he thought 
had gone out onto the and over the to the 
door opening into the garden where seeing and the emperor 
returning to the he stood still they were moving toward 
the door boris as if he had not had time 
to respectfully pressed close to the with bowed head  
the emperor with the agitation of one who has been 
personally was finishing with these words   enter russia 
without war i will not make peace as long as 
a single remains in my country it seemed to boris 
that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words 
he was satisfied with the form in which he had 
expressed his thoughts but that boris had it   
no one know of it the emperor added with a 
frown  boris understood that this was meant for him 
and his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor the 
ballroom and remained there about another half  boris was 
thus the first to learn the news that the french 
army had the and to this was able to show 
certain important that much that was from others was usually 
known to him and by this means he rose higher 
in their   the news of the french having 
the was particularly after a month of expectations and at 
a ball on first receiving the news under the influence 
of and the emperor had found a phrase that pleased 
him fully expressed his and has since become famous on 
returning home at two o that night he sent for 
his secretary and told him to write an order to 
the and a to field prince in which he on 
the words being that he would not make peace so 
long as a single frenchman remained on russian soil  
next day the following letter was sent to napoleon  
 monsieur mon  yesterday i learned that despite the 
with which i have kept my with your majesty your 
have the russian and i have this moment received from 
petersburg a note in which count me as a reason 
for this that your majesty has considered yourself to be 
in a state of war with me from the time 
prince kuragin asked for his the reasons on which the 
duc de his to them to him would never have 
led me to suppose that that could serve as a 
pretext for in fact the ambassador as he himself has 
declared was never to make that demand and as soon 
as i was of it i let him know how 
much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain 
at his post if your majesty does not to the 
blood of our for such a and to your from 
russian i will regard what has passed as not having 
occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in 
the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced 
to an attack that nothing on my part has it 
still depends on your majesty to from the of another 
war i am   alexander     
 chapter iv   at two in the morning 
of the of the emperor having sent for and read 
him his letter to napoleon ordered him to take it 
and hand it personally to the french emperor when the 
emperor repeated to him the words that he would not 
make peace so long as a single remained on russian 
soil and told him to those words to napoleon alexander 
did not them in his letter to napoleon because with 
his tact he felt it would be to use them 
at a moment when a last at was being made 
but he to them personally to napoleon  having set 
off in the small hours of the accompanied by a 
and two reached the french at the village of on 
the russian side of the by dawn there he was 
stopped by french cavalry  a french officer of hussars 
in crimson uniform and a cap shouted to the approaching 
to halt did not do so at once but continued 
to along the road at a  the officer frowned 
and muttering words of his horse chest against put his 
hand to his saber and shouted at the russian general 
asking was he that he did not do as he 
was told mentioned who he was the officer began talking 
with his comrades about matters without looking at the russian 
general  after living at the seat of the highest 
and power after conversing with the emperor less than three 
hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect 
to his rank in the service found it very strange 
here on russian soil to this and still more this 
of force to himself  the sun was only just 
from behind the the air was fresh and a of 
cattle was being driven along the road from the village 
and over the the rose one after another like rising 
in water  looked around him awaiting the arrival of 
an officer from the village the russian and and the 
french hussars looked silently at one another from time to 
time  a french colonel of hussars who had evidently 
just left his bed came from the village on a 
handsome gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the 
soldiers and their horses all looked and well kept  
it was that first period of a when are still 
in full almost like that of but with a of 
in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and 
spirit of which always the opening of a  the 
french colonel with difficulty a but was polite and evidently 
understood importance he led him past his soldiers and behind 
the and told him that his wish to be to 
the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the 
emperor were he believed not far off  they through 
the village of past french hussar horses past and men 
who their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian 
uniform and came out at the other end of the 
village the colonel said that the commander of the was 
a mile and a away and would receive and conduct 
him to his  the sun had by now and 
shone gaily on the bright  they had hardly up 
a hill past a before they saw a group of 
coming toward them in front of the group on a 
black horse with that in the sun a tall man 
with in his hat and black hair down to his 
shoulders he wore a red mantle and his long legs 
forward in french fashion this man toward at a his 
and his and gold lace in the bright  was 
only two horses length from the with the and gold 
embroidery who was toward him with a solemn countenance when 
the french colonel whispered respectfully  king of it was 
in fact now called  of though it was quite 
why he should be king of he was called so 
and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore 
assumed a more solemn and important air than he was 
so sure that he really was the king of that 
when on the of his from that city while through 
the with his wife some called out to him  
il  he turned to his wife with a smile 
and said  fellows they don know that i am 
leaving them tomorrow        
 live the king   but though he firmly 
believed himself to be king of and pitied the felt 
by the he was after he had been ordered to 
return to military service especially since his last interview with 
napoleon in when his august brother had told him  
made you king that you should in my way but 
not in yours had taken up his familiar business and 
a well but not horse that himself in and between 
the dressed up in clothes as and as possible and 
gaily and along the of without himself knowing why or 
 on seeing the russian general he threw back his 
head with its long hair to his shoulders in a 
manner and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel 
respectfully his majesty of whose name he could not pronounce 
  said the king  by his assurance the 
difficulty that had itself to the colonel  to make 
your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of condescension 
 as soon as the king began to speak loud 
and fast his dignity instantly him and without noticing it 
he passed into his natural tone of good familiarity he 
laid his hand on the of horse and said  
 general it all looks like war as if a 
of which he was unable to judge   majesty 
replied  the emperor does not desire war and as 
your majesty said using the words your majesty at every 
opportunity with the affectation in frequently addressing one to whom 
the was still a  face beamed with stupid satisfaction 
as he listened to  de but  and he 
felt it on him as a king and an to 
on state affairs with alexander he took arm and moving 
a few steps away from his which waited respectfully began 
to up and down with him trying to speak significantly 
he to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented 
the demand that he should his from prussia especially when 
that demand became generally known and the dignity of france 
was offended         
has its   replied that there was  offensive 
in the demand because but interrupted him   you 
don consider the emperor alexander the he asked unexpectedly with 
a kindly and foolish smile  told him why he 
considered napoleon to be the of the war   
my dear general again interrupted him  all my heart 
i wish the may arrange the affair between them and 
that the war by no wish of mine may finish 
as quickly as possible said he in the tone of 
a who wants to remain good friends with another despite 
a between their  and he went on to about 
the grand and the state of his health and to 
of the gay and amusing times he had spent with 
him in then suddenly as if his dignity solemnly drew 
himself up assumed the in which he had stood at 
his coronation and his right arm said   won 
you longer general i wish success to your and with 
his embroidered red mantle his and his he rejoined his 
who were respectfully awaiting him  on from words that 
he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but 
instead of that at the next village the of infantry 
corps detained him as the of the had done and 
an adjutant of the corps commander who was conducted him 
into the village to      chapter 
v   was to napoleon what was to alexander 
not a like he was as as cruel and as 
unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by 
 in the of such men are necessary as are 
necessary in the of nature and they always exist always 
appear and hold their own however their presence and their 
to the head of the government may be this alone 
can explain how the cruel who out a mustache with 
his own hands whose weak him unable to face danger 
and who was neither an educated man nor a was 
able to maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own 
character was noble and gentle  found seated on a 
in the of a was accounts better could have been 
found him but was one of those men who put 
themselves in most to have a for being gloomy for 
the same reason they are always hard at work and 
in a  can i think of the bright side 
of life when as you see i am sitting on 
a and in a dirty the expression of his face 
seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such 
men when they anyone who shows animation is to their 
own allowed himself that pleasure when was brought in he 
became still more in his task when the russian general 
entered and after glancing over his spectacles at face which 
was animated by the beauty of the morning and by 
his talk with he did not rise or even stir 
but still more and  when he noticed in face 
the disagreeable this reception produced raised his head and coldly 
asked what he wanted  thinking he could have been 
received in such a manner only because did not know 
that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and 
even his to napoleon hastened to inform him of his 
rank and contrary to his after hearing him became still 
and   is your dispatch he inquired  it 
to me i will send it to the emperor  
replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally 
to the emperor   emperor orders are in your 
army but here said  must do as you told 
 and as if to make the russian general still 
more conscious of his on force sent an adjutant to 
call the officer on duty  took out the the 
emperor letter and laid it on the table  of 
a door with its still hanging on it laid across 
two took the and read the   are perfectly 
at liberty to treat me with respect or not  
me to observe that i have the honor to be 
adjutant general to his majesty  glanced at him silently 
and plainly pleasure from the signs of agitation and which 
appeared on face   will be treated as is 
said he and putting the in his left the  
a minute later the adjutant de came in and conducted 
to the assigned him  that day he with the 
at the same board on the  next day out 
early and after asking to come to him him to 
remain there to move on with the train should orders 
come for it to move and to talk to no 
one except monsieur de  after four days of and 
consciousness of his and by contrast with the of power 
in which he had so lately moved after several with 
the and the french army which occupied the whole was 
brought to occupied by the french the very by which 
he had left it four days  next day the 
imperial the de came to and him of the emperor 
napoleon wish to honor him with an audience  four 
days before of the regiment had stood in front of 
the house to which was conducted and now two french 
stood there in blue unfastened in front and with on 
their heads and an of hussars and and a brilliant 
of and who were waiting for napoleon to come out 
were standing at the porch round his horse and his 
napoleon received in the very house in from which alexander 
had him on his      chapter 
vi   though was used to imperial he was 
at the and of napoleon court  the de showed 
him into a big reception room where many gentlemen and 
of whom had seen at the court of the emperor 
of russia waiting said that napoleon would receive the russian 
general before going for his ride  after some minutes 
the who was on duty came into the great reception 
room and politely asked to follow him  went into 
a small reception room one door of which led into 
a study the very one from which the russian emperor 
had him on his he stood a minute or two 
waiting he heard hurried footsteps the door both of it 
were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the 
study the sound was heard of other steps firm and 
resolute were those of napoleon he had just finished for 
his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front 
over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his 
white breeches tightly the fat of his short legs and 
his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one 
lock down in the middle of his broad forehead his 
plump white neck stood out above the black collar of 
his uniform and he of de his full face rather 
young with its prominent wore a gracious and expression of 
imperial  he entered briskly with a at every step 
and his head slightly thrown back his whole short figure 
with broad thick shoulders and chest and had that and 
appearance one in men of forty who live in it 
was evident too that he was in the best of 
that day  he nodded in answer to low and 
bow and coming up to him at once began speaking 
like a man who every moment of his time and 
does not to prepare what he has to say but 
is sure he will always say the right thing and 
say it well   day general said he  
have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander 
and am very glad to see you he glanced with 
his large eyes into face and immediately looked past him 
 it was plain that did not interest him at 
all evidently only what took place within his own mind 
interested him nothing outside himself had any for him because 
everything in the world it seemed to him entirely on 
his will   do not and did not desire 
war he continued  it has been forced on me 
even now  the word  am ready to receive 
any you can give me  and he began clearly 
and to explain his reasons for with the russian government 
by the and tone in which the french emperor spoke 
was firmly that he wished for peace and intended to 
enter into  when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly 
at the russian began a speech he had prepared long 
before  the emperor my but the sight of the 
emperor eyes bent on him confused him  are flurried 
yourself napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible 
smile he looked at uniform and sword  himself and 
began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did 
not consider demand for his a sufficient cause for war 
that had acted on his own and without his sovereign 
that the emperor alexander did not desire war and had 
no relations with england   yet interposed napoleon and 
as if fearing to give to his he frowned and 
nodded slightly as a sign that might  after saying 
all he had been to say added that the emperor 
alexander wished for peace but would not enter into except 
on condition that here he remembered the words the emperor 
alexander had not written in his letter but had specially 
in the to and had told to to napoleon remembered 
these words  long as a single foe remains on 
russian soil but some feeling him he could not utter 
them though he wished to do so he grew confused 
and said  condition that the french army the  
napoleon noticed embarrassment when uttering these last words his face 
and the of his left began to without moving from 
where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone 
and more hurriedly than before during the speech that followed 
who more than once lowered his eyes noticed the quivering 
of napoleon left which the more napoleon raised his voice 
  desire peace no less than the emperor alexander 
he began  i not for months been doing everything 
to obtain it i have waited months for but in 
order to begin what is demanded of me he said 
frowning and making an gesture of inquiry with his small 
white plump hand   of your army the replied 
  repeated napoleon  now you want me to 
retire the the repeated napoleon looking straight at  the 
latter bowed his head respectfully  instead of the demand 
of four months earlier to from only a the was 
now demanded napoleon turned quickly and began to the room 
  say the demand now is that i am 
to the before but in just the same way two 
months ago the demand was that i should the and 
the and yet you are to  he went in 
silence from one corner of the room to the other 
and again stopped in front of noticed that his left 
was quivering than before and his face seemed in its 
stern expression this quivering of his left was a thing 
napoleon was conscious of  of my left is a 
great sign with me he remarked at a later  
 as to the and may be made to a 
prince of but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite 
to his own surprise  you gave me petersburg and 
moscow i could not accept such you say i have 
this war but who first joined his army the emperor 
alexander not i and you me when i have millions 
when you are in alliance with england and when your 
position is a bad one you me but what is 
the aim of your alliance with england what has she 
given you he continued hurriedly evidently no longer trying to 
show the advantages of peace and discuss its but only 
to prove his own and power and alexander and  
the of his speech had obviously been made with the 
intention of the advantages of his position and showing that 
he was nevertheless to but he had talking and the 
more he talked the less could he control his words 
 the whole of his remarks now was evidently to 
himself and alexander what he had least desired at the 
of the interview   hear you have made peace 
with  bowed his head   has been concluded 
he began  but napoleon did not let him speak 
he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself and 
continued to talk with the sort of and to which 
spoiled people are so   i know you have 
made peace with the without and i would have given 
your sovereign those as i gave him yes he went 
on  promised and would have given the emperor alexander 
and and now he won have those splendid yet he 
might have them to his empire and in a single 
would have russia from the of to the of the 
catherine the great could not have done more said napoleon 
growing more and more as he up and down the 
room repeating to almost the very words he had used 
to alexander himself at  that he would have to 
my friendship oh what a splendid he repeated several times 
then paused drew from his a gold snuffbox lifted it 
to his nose and at it   a splendid 
the emperor alexander might have been  he looked at 
and as soon as the latter tried to make some 
rejoinder hastily interrupted him   could he wish or 
look for that he would not have obtained through my 
friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in  no he 
has to himself with my and with whom with and 
a traitor expelled from his own country a and an 
wintzingerode a french subject rather more of a than the 
others but all the same an who was unable to 
do anything in  and who should terrible in the 
emperor alexander mind that were they they might be made 
use of continued napoleon able to keep in words with 
the rush of thoughts that up how right and strong 
he was  his perception the two were one and 
the same they are not even that they are neither 
fit for war nor peace is said to be the 
most capable of them all but i cannot say so 
by his first movements and what are they doing all 
these considers and called on to act does not know 
what to decide on and time bringing no result alone 
is a military man he stupid but he has experience 
a quick eye and resolution and what role is your 
young monarch playing in that crowd they him and throw 
on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign 
should not be with the army unless he is a 
general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as a direct 
challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to 
be a military commander   began only a week 
ago and you haven even been able to defend you 
are cut in two and have been driven out of 
the your army is   the contrary your majesty 
said hardly able to remember what had been said to 
him and following these fireworks with difficulty  are burning 
with eagerness   know everything napoleon interrupted him  
know everything i know the number of your as exactly 
as i know my own you have not two hundred 
thousand men and i have three times that number i 
give you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that 
his word of honor could carry no weight give you 
my word of honor that i have five hundred and 
thirty thousand men this side of the the will be 
of no use to you they are worth nothing and 
have shown it by making peace with you as for 
the is their fate to be by mad their king 
was and they changed him for another who went mad 
no would himself with russia unless he were mad  
napoleon and again raised his snuffbox to his nose  
knew how to reply to each of napoleon remarks and 
would have done so he continually made the gesture of 
a man wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted 
him to the of the wished to reply that when 
russia is on her side is an island but napoleon 
gave an angry to his voice napoleon was in that 
state of in which a man has to talk talk 
and talk merely to himself that he is in the 
right began to feel uncomfortable as he feared to his 
dignity and felt the necessity of but as a man 
he before the of that had evidently seized napoleon he 
knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon 
had any and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of 
them when he came to his stood with eyes looking 
at the movements of napoleon stout legs and trying to 
avoid meeting his eyes   what do i care 
about your said napoleon  have there are eighty thousand 
of them and they fight like and there will be 
two hundred thousand of them  and probably still more 
by the fact that he had uttered this obvious and 
that still stood silently before him in the same attitude 
of to fate napoleon turned round drew close to face 
and gesticulating rapidly and with his white hands almost shouted 
  that if you stir up prussia against me 
i it off the map of europe he declared his 
face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one 
of his small hands with the other  i will 
throw you back the and the and will against you 
that which it was and of europe to allow to 
be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you 
that is what you have gained by me and he 
walked silently several times up and down the room his 
fat shoulders  he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat 
took it out again lifted it several times to his 
nose and stopped in front of he paused looked ironically 
straight into eyes and said in a quiet voice  
 yet what a splendid your might have had  
feeling it on him to reply said that from the 
russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a 
light napoleon was silent still looking at him and evidently 
not listening to him said that in russia the best 
were expected from the war napoleon nodded as if to 
say  know it your duty to say that but 
you don believe it yourself i have convinced you  
when had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox at 
it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as 
a signal the door opened a bending respectfully the emperor 
his hat and gloves another brought him a handkerchief napoleon 
without giving them a glance turned to   the 
emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat  
i am as devoted to him as before i know 
him thoroughly and very highly his lofty qualities i will 
you no longer general you shall receive my letter to 
the emperor  and napoleon went quickly to the door 
everyone in the reception room rushed forward and the staircase 
     chapter vii   after 
all that napoleon had said to him of anger and 
the last dryly spoken words  will you no longer 
general you shall receive my letter felt convinced that napoleon 
would not wish to see him and would even avoid 
another meeting with him as he had his anger but 
to his surprise received through an invitation to dine with 
the emperor that day  and were present at that 
dinner  napoleon met and amiably he not only showed 
no sign of or self on account of his outburst 
that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure it 
was evident that he had long been convinced that it 
was impossible for him to make a mistake and that 
in his perception he did was right not because it 
with any idea of right and wrong but because he 
did it  the emperor was in very good after 
his ride through where of people had greeted and followed 
him from all the of the through which he and 
his monogram were and the ladies him waved their to 
him  at dinner having placed beside him napoleon not 
only treated him amiably but behaved as if were one 
of his own one of those who with his and 
ought to rejoice at his success in the course of 
conversation he mentioned moscow and about the russian capital not 
merely as an interested asks about a new city he 
to visit but as if convinced that as a russian 
must be flattered by his curiosity   many are 
there in moscow how many is it true that moscow 
is called  moscow how many are there in moscow 
he asked  and receiving the reply that there were 
more than two hundred he remarked   such a 
of   russians are very replied   a 
large number of and is always a sign of the 
of a people said napoleon turning to for appreciation of 
this remark  respectfully to with the french emperor  
 country has its own character said he   
nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon 
  beg your majesty returned  russia there is 
where there are also many and  this reply of 
which at the of the french in was much appreciated 
when he related it at alexander court but it was 
not much appreciated at napoleon dinner where it passed  
the and perplexed faces of the showed that they were 
as to what tone suggested  there is a point 
we don see it or it is not at all 
witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his 
rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all 
and naively asked through what the direct road from there 
to moscow passed who was on the all through the 
dinner replied that just as  lead to so all 
lead to moscow there were many and  them the 
road through which xii chose flushed with pleasure at the 
of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word 
before began speaking of the of the road from petersburg 
to moscow and of his petersburg  after dinner they 
went to drink in napoleon study which four days had 
been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down with 
his cup and to a chair beside him  napoleon 
was in that well after mood which more than any 
cause makes a man with himself and disposed to consider 
everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was 
by men who adored him and he felt convinced that 
after his dinner too was his friend and napoleon turned 
to him with a pleasant though slightly smile   
tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied 
strange isn it general he said evidently not that this 
remark would be agreeable to his since it went to 
prove his napoleon superiority to alexander  made no reply 
and bowed his head in silence   four days 
ago in this room wintzingerode and were continued napoleon with 
the same and self smile  i can understand he 
went on  that the emperor alexander has himself with 
my that i do not understand has he not thought 
that i may do the same and he turned inquiringly 
to and evidently this thought turned him back on to 
the of his morning anger which was still fresh in 
him   let him know that i will do 
so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with 
his hand  drive all his and relations out of 
germany yes i drive them out let him prepare an 
for them in russia  bowed his head with an 
air indicating that he would like to make his bow 
and leave and only listened because he could not help 
hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice 
this expression he treated not as an from his but 
as a man now fully devoted to him and who 
must rejoice at his former humiliation   why has 
the emperor alexander taken command of the what is the 
good of that war is my profession but his business 
is to and not to command why has he taken 
on himself such a responsibility  again napoleon brought out 
his snuffbox several times up and down the room in 
silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to and 
with a slight smile as quickly and simply as if 
he were doing something not merely important but to he 
raised his hand to the forty russian general face and 
taking him by the pulled it gently smiling with his 
lips only  to have one pulled by the emperor 
was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at 
the french court   and of the emperor alexander 
why don you say anything said he as if it 
was in his presence to be the and of anyone 
but himself napoleon  the horses ready for the general 
he added with a slight of his head in reply 
to bow  him have mine he has a long 
way to go  the letter taken by was the 
last napoleon sent to alexander every of the interview was 
to the russian monarch and the war began   
   chapter viii   after his interview 
with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on 
business as he told his family but really to meet 
anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to on reaching 
petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already 
left the city pierre had his brother that prince andrew 
was on his anatole kuragin obtained an appointment from the 
of war and went to join the army in while 
in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who 
was always well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that 
he should him to the army in to which the 
old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince 
andrew having received an appointment on the staff left for 
 prince andrew did not think it proper to write 
and challenge kuragin he thought that if he him without 
some fresh cause it might the young countess rostova and 
so he wanted to meet kuragin personally in order to 
find a fresh pretext for a but he again failed 
to meet kuragin in for soon after prince andrew arrived 
the latter returned to russia in a new country amid 
new prince andrew found life to bear after his had 
broken faith with him he felt the more the more 
he tried to its in which he had been happy 
became trying to him and the freedom and he had 
once so highly were still more so not only could 
he no longer think the thoughts that had first come 
to him as he lay gazing at the sky on 
the field of and had later upon with pierre and 
which had filled his at and then in and but 
he even to them and the bright and they had 
revealed he was now concerned only with the practical matters 
to his past interests and he seized on these the 
more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to 
him it was as if that lofty of heaven that 
had once above him had suddenly turned into a low 
that him down in which all was clear but nothing 
or  of the that themselves to him army service 
was the simplest and most familiar as a general on 
duty on kutuzov staff he himself to business with and 
and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and in work not 
having found kuragin in prince andrew did not think it 
necessary to rush back to russia after him but all 
the same he knew that however long it might be 
before he met kuragin despite his for him and despite 
all the he to himself that it was not worth 
to a with him knew that when he did meet 
him he would not be able to calling him out 
any more than a man can help snatching at food 
and the consciousness that the was not yet that his 
was still on his heart and the artificial which he 
managed to obtain in by means of and rather and 
 in the year  when news of the war 
with napoleon reached kutuzov had been living for two months 
passing his days and with a woman andrew asked kutuzov 
to him to the army kutuzov who was already weary 
of bolkonski which seemed to reproach his own very let 
him go and gave him a to de  before 
joining the army which was then in may at prince 
andrew bald hills which was on his way being only 
two off the during the last three years there had 
been so many in his life he had thought felt 
and seen so much  both in the east and 
the west that on reaching bald hills it struck him 
as strange and to find the way of life there 
and still the same in every he entered through the 
with their stone and drove up the leading to the 
house as if he were entering an enchanted the same 
old the same the same there and inside there was 
the same the same sounds and smell and the same 
timid faces only older princess mary was still the same 
timid plain getting on in years and passing the best 
years of her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle 
was the same coquettish self girl every moment of her 
and full of joyous for the future she had merely 
become more self prince andrew thought the tutor he had 
brought from was wearing a coat of russian cut and 
talking broken russian to the but was still the same 
intelligent conscientious and the old prince had changed in appearance 
only by the of a which left a on one 
side of his mouth in character he was the same 
as ever only showing still more and as to what 
was in the world little nicholas alone had changed he 
had grown become had curly dark hair and when merry 
and laughing quite lifted the upper lip of his pretty 
little mouth just as the little princess used to do 
he alone did not obey the law of in the 
enchanted but though all remained as of old the inner 
relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew 
had seen them last the household was divided into two 
and who changed their for his sake and only met 
because he was there to the one belonged the old 
prince mademoiselle and the to the other princess mary little 
nicholas and all the old and maids  during his 
stay at bald hills all the family together but they 
were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he 
was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being 
made and that his presence made them all feel awkward 
feeling this at dinner on the first day he was 
and the old prince noticing this also became and to 
his apartments after dinner in the evening when prince andrew 
went to him and trying to rouse him began to 
tell him of the young count the old prince began 
unexpectedly to talk about princess mary her for her and 
her of mademoiselle who he said was the only person 
really attached to him  the old prince said that 
if he was ill it was only because of princess 
mary that she and him and that by and silly 
talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the old prince 
knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that 
her life was very hard but he also knew that 
he could not help her and that she deserved it 
 does prince andrew who this say nothing to me 
about his sister does he think me a or an 
old fool who without any reason his own daughter at 
a distance and this to himself he doesn understand so 
i must explain it and he must hear me out 
thought the old prince and he began explaining why he 
could not put up with his daughter character   
you ask me said prince andrew without looking up  
was his father for the first time in his life 
 did not wish to speak about it but as 
you ask me i will give you my frank opinion 
if there is any and between you and mary i 
can her for it at all i know how she 
and you since you ask me continued prince andrew becoming 
he was always to do of late can only say 
that if there are any misunderstandings they are by that 
woman who is not fit to be my sister companion 
 the old man at first stared fixedly at his 
son and an unnatural smile the fresh between his teeth 
to which prince andrew could not get accustomed   
companion my dear boy eh you already been talking it 
over eh   i did not want to judge 
said prince andrew in a hard and tone  you 
me and i have said and always shall say that 
mary is not to but those to one to that 
  he has passed passed said the old man 
in a low voice and as it seemed to prince 
andrew with some embarrassment but then he suddenly jumped up 
and cried  off be off let not a trace 
of you remain here   prince andrew wished to 
leave at once but princess mary him to stay another 
day that day he did not see his father who 
did not leave his room and no one but mademoiselle 
and but asked several times whether his son had gone 
next day before leaving prince andrew went to his son 
rooms the boy curly like his mother and with health 
sat on his knee and prince andrew began telling him 
the story of but fell into a without finishing the 
story he thought not of this pretty child his son 
whom he held on his knee but of himself he 
in himself either for having his father or regret at 
leaving home for the first time in his life on 
bad terms with him and was to find neither what 
meant still more to him was that he and did 
not find in himself the former tenderness for his son 
which he had to by the boy and taking him 
on his knee   go on said his son 
 prince andrew without put him down from his knee 
and went out of the room  as soon as 
prince andrew had given up his and especially on returning 
to the old of life amid which he had been 
happy weariness of life him with its former and he 
hastened to escape from these and to find some work 
as soon as possible   you decided to go 
andrew asked his sister   god that i can 
replied prince andrew  am very sorry you can  
 do you say that replied princess mary  do 
you say that when you are going to this terrible 
war and he is so old mademoiselle says he has 
been asking about you  as soon as she began 
to speak of that her lips trembled and her tears 
began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing 
the room   my god my god when one 
thinks who and what cause people he said with a 
that alarmed princess mary  she understood that when speaking 
of  he not only to mademoiselle the cause of 
her but also to the man who had his own 
happiness   one thing i beg i entreat of 
you she said touching his elbow and looking at him 
with eyes that shone through her tears  understand you 
 looked down  imagine that sorrow is the work 
of men men are his she looked a little above 
prince andrew head with the confident accustomed look with which 
one looks at the place where a familiar portrait  
is sent by him not by men men are his 
instruments they are not to if you think someone has 
you forget it and forgive we have no right to 
and then you will know the happiness of   
i were a woman i would do so mary that 
is a woman but a man should not and cannot 
forgive and forget he replied and though till that moment 
he had not been thinking of kuragin all his anger 
suddenly up in his heart   mary is already 
me to forgive it means that i ought long ago 
to have him he thought and giving her no further 
reply he began thinking of the glad moment when he 
would meet kuragin who he knew was now in the 
army  princess mary begged him to stay one day 
more saying that she knew how unhappy her father would 
be if andrew left without being to him but prince 
andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again 
from the army and would certainly write to his father 
but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered 
their would become   andrew remember that come from 
god and men are never to were the last words 
he heard from his sister when he took leave of 
her   it must be so thought prince andrew 
as he drove out of the from the house at 
bald hills  poor innocent creature is left to be 
by an old man who has his the old man 
he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is 
growing up and in life in which like everybody else 
he will or be and i am off to the 
army why i myself don know i want to meet 
that man whom i so as to give him a 
to kill and laugh at me  these of life 
had been the same before but then they were all 
connected while now they had all to only things themselves 
one after another to prince andrew mind    
  chapter ix   prince andrew reached the 
general of the army at the end of the first 
army with which was the emperor occupied the at the 
second army was trying to effect a with the first 
one from which it was said to be cut off 
by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general 
course of affairs in the russian army but no one 
any danger of of the russian and no one thought 
the war would farther than the the  prince andrew 
found de to whom he had been assigned on the 
bank of the as there was not a single town 
or large village in the of the the immense number 
of and the army were living in the best of 
the on both sides of the river over a of 
six de was nearly three from the emperor he received 
bolkonski and coldly and told him in his foreign accent 
that he would mention him to the emperor for a 
decision as to his but asked him meanwhile to remain 
on his staff anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had to 
find with the army was not there he had gone 
to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this 
his mind was occupied by the interests of the center 
that was a gigantic war and he was glad to 
be free for a while from the distraction by the 
thought of kuragin during the first four days while no 
duties were of him prince andrew round the whole and 
by the of his own knowledge and by with tried 
to form a definite opinion about it but the question 
whether the was advantageous or remained for him already from 
his military experience and what he had seen in the 
he had come to the that in war the most 
deeply considered have no and that all depends on the 
way movements of the cannot be met and on how 
and by whom the whole matter is to clear up 
this last point for himself prince andrew his position and 
tried to the character of the control of the army 
and of the men and parties engaged in it and 
he for himself the following of the state of affairs 
 while the emperor had still been at the forces 
had been divided into three first the army under de 
the army under and the one by the emperor was 
with the first army but not as commander in chief 
in the orders it was not that the emperor would 
take command but only that he would be with the 
army the emperor moreover had with him not a commander 
in chief staff but the imperial staff in on him 
was the head of the imperial staff general prince as 
well as imperial and a large number of but not 
the army staff besides these there were in on the 
emperor without any definite the of war count the senior 
general in rank the grand count rumyantsev the a former 
prussian a general the chief of the plan of an 
adjutant general and many others though these men had no 
military appointment in the army their position gave them influence 
and often a corps commander or even the commander in 
chief did not know in what capacity he was by 
the grand or prince or was given this or that 
advice and did not know whether a certain order received 
in the form of advice from the man who gave 
it or from the emperor and whether it had to 
be or not but this was only the condition the 
essential of the presence of the emperor and of all 
these people from a point of  in an emperor 
all became was clear to everyone it was this the 
emperor did not the of commander in chief but disposed 
of all the the men around him were his was 
a faithful to order and acted as the sovereign was 
a in the who appeared to be doing the of 
the but was in a good general as an and 
ready at hand to the grand was there because it 
him to be the was there because his advice was 
and the emperor alexander held him in high personally napoleon 
and was a general full of self a that always 
alexander was there because he was bold and decided in 
speech the adjutants general were there because they always accompanied 
the emperor and and chiefly was there because he had 
drawn up the plan of against napoleon and having alexander 
to believe in the of that plan was the whole 
business of the war with was who expressed thoughts in 
a more way than himself  was a self to 
the point of everyone else was able to do  
besides these russians and who new and ideas every day 
the who did so with a boldness of people employed 
in a country not their own were many the army 
because their were there  among the opinions and voices 
in this immense brilliant and proud prince andrew noticed the 
following of and parties  the first party of and 
his who believed in a science of war with of 
movements and so and his demanded a into the of 
the country in with by a of war and they 
saw only or intention in every from that theory to 
this party belonged the foreign wintzingerode and others chiefly  
the second party was to the first one extreme as 
always happens was met by of the other the members 
of this party were those who had demanded an from 
into and freedom from all besides being of bold this 
section also which made them still more one in the 
they were russians  was beginning to come to the 
front and others at that time a famous joke of 
was being that as a great favor he had the 
emperor to make him a german the men of that 
party suvorov said that what one had to do was 
not to reason or stick into but to fight beat 
the keep him out of russia and not let the 
army get  to the third party which the emperor 
had most confidence the who tried to arrange between the 
other two the members of this party chiefly and to 
whom belonged thought and said what men who have no 
but wish to seem to have some generally say they 
said that war particularly against such a as bonaparte  
called him bonaparte now most deeply and profound knowledge and 
in that respect was a but at the same time 
it had to be that the are often one and 
therefore one should not them absolutely but should also listen 
to what and practical men of experience in had to 
say and then choose a middle course they on the 
of the at to plan but on changing the movements 
of the other though by this course neither one aim 
nor the other could be yet it seemed best to 
the of this third party  of a fourth opinion 
the most was the who could not forget his at 
where he had out at the head of the guards 
in his and cavalry uniform as to a expecting to 
crush the french but unexpectedly finding himself in the front 
line had amid the general the men of this party 
had both the and the defect of in their opinions 
they feared napoleon recognized his strength and their own weakness 
and said so they said  but sorrow shame and 
will come of all this we have and and shall 
the only thing left to do is to peace as 
soon as possible before we are turned out of petersburg 
 this was very general in the upper army and 
found support also in petersburg and from the rumyantsev who 
for other reasons of state was in favor of peace 
 the party of those who were of de not 
so much as a man but as of war and 
commander in chief  he what he may  always 
began like that  is an practical man and we 
have better give him real power for war cannot be 
conducted without of command and he will show what he 
can do as he did in if our army is 
well and strong and has to without suffering any we 
this entirely to if is now to be by all 
will be lost for showed his already in   
the party the said on the contrary that at any 
rate there was no one more active and experienced than 
 about as you may you will have to come 
to let the others make now said they arguing that 
our to was a most shameful reverse and an of 
 more that are made the better it will at 
any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot 
go on like this what is wanted is not some 
or other but a man like who made his mark 
in  and to whom napoleon himself did man whose 
would be willingly recognized and is the only such man 
 the party of the sort of people who are 
always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of 
whom there were particularly many round alexander and imperial passionately 
devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but 
as a man him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had 
done in  and who saw in him not only 
all the but all human as well these men though 
enchanted with the sovereign for the command of the army 
yet him for such and only desired and that their 
adored sovereign should his and announce that he would place 
himself at the head of the army round him a 
commander in chief staff and experienced and practical men where 
necessary would himself lead the whose would be raised to 
the highest pitch  the and group which in its 
enormous was to the others as to one of men 
who desired neither peace nor war neither an nor a 
at the or anywhere else neither nor the emperor neither 
nor but only the one most essential thing much and 
pleasure for themselves as possible in the of and intrigues 
that about the emperor it was possible to succeed in 
many at other times a man who simply wished to 
his post would today agree with tomorrow with his and 
the day after merely to avoid responsibility or to please 
the emperor would that he had no opinion at all 
on the matter another who wished to gain some would 
attract the emperor attention by loudly the very thing the 
emperor had at the day before and would and at 
the his breast and those who did not agree with 
him to that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for 
the common good a third in the of between two 
would simply a special for his faithful well knowing that 
at that moment people would be too busy to refuse 
him a fourth while with work would often come under 
the emperor eye a to his long aim of dining 
with the emperor would on the or of some newly 
opinion and for this object would produce more or less 
and correct  all the men of this party were 
for rubles and and in this watched only the of 
imperial favor and they noticed it turning in any direction 
this whole of the army began hard that way so 
that it was all the for the emperor to turn 
it amid the of the position with the menace of 
serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid 
this of egotism of views and and the of race 
among these people and party of those with interests great 
and to the common task question a of these without 
having finished their on a previous over to the new 
one and by their drowned and the voices of those 
who were  from among all these parties just at 
the time prince andrew reached the army another a party 
was being formed and was beginning to its voice this 
was the party of the elders men experienced and capable 
in state affairs who without sharing any of those opinions 
were able to take a of what was going on 
at the staff at and to consider means of escape 
from this and weakness  the men of this party 
said and thought that what was wrong chiefly from the 
emperor presence in the army with his military court and 
from the presence there of an and of relations which 
is in place at court but in an army that 
a sovereign should but not command the army and that 
the only way out of the position would be for 
the emperor and his court to leave the army that 
the mere presence of the emperor the of fifty thousand 
men to secure his safety and that the commander in 
chief if would be better than the very best one 
by the presence and of the monarch  just at 
the time prince andrew was living at the secretary of 
state and one of the chief of this party wrote 
a letter to the emperor which and agreed to sign 
in this letter availing himself of given him by the 
emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully 
suggested the that it was necessary for the sovereign to 
a spirit in the people of the capital the emperor 
should leave the army  that of the people by 
their sovereign and his call to them to defend their 
country very which was the chief cause of russia in 
so far as it was produced by the presence in 
moscow suggested to the emperor and by him as a 
pretext for the army      chapter 
x   this letter had not yet been to 
the emperor when one day at dinner bolkonski that the 
sovereign wished to see him personally to question him about 
and that prince andrew was to present himself at at 
six that evening  news was received at the emperor 
that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which 
might the army subsequently found to be and that morning 
colonel had round the with the emperor and had pointed 
out to him that this by and till then considered 
a of science which would napoleon was an threatening the 
of the russian army  prince andrew arrived at country 
house of size on the very of the river neither 
nor the emperor was there but the emperor aide received 
bolkonski and him that the emperor accompanied by general and 
had gone a second time that day to the of 
the of the of which serious were beginning to be 
felt  was sitting at a window in the first 
room with a french in his hand this room had 
probably been a music room there was still an in 
it on which some were and in one corner stood 
the of adjutant this adjutant was also there and sat 
on the rolled evidently exhausted by work or by feasting 
two doors led from the room one straight on into 
what had been the drawing room and another on the 
right to the study through the first door came the 
sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french 
in that drawing room were gathered by the emperor wish 
not a military  emperor but certain persons whose opinions 
he wished to know in of the difficulties it was 
not a of war but as it were a to 
certain questions for the emperor personally to this had been 
the general adjutant general wintzingerode  napoleon had to as 
a french subject count who was not a military man 
at all and himself who as prince andrew had heard 
was the of the whole affair prince andrew had an 
opportunity of getting a good look at him for arrived 
soon after himself and in passing through to the drawing 
room stopped a minute to speak to  at first 
sight in his ill uniform of a russian general which 
him badly like a fancy seemed familiar to prince andrew 
though he saw him now for the first time there 
was about him something of and and many other german 
whom prince andrew had seen in  but he was 
more than any of them prince andrew had never yet 
seen a german in whom all the of those others 
were to such an  was short and very thin 
but broad of coarse build broad in the and with 
prominent shoulder his face was much wrinkled and his eyes 
deep set his hair had evidently been hastily brushed in 
front of the but stuck up behind in little he 
entered the room looking and angrily around as if afraid 
of everything in that large awkwardly holding up his sword 
he addressed and asked in german where the emperor was 
one could see that he wished to pass through the 
rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and 
greetings and sit down to business in front of a 
map where he would feel at home he nodded hurriedly 
in reply to and smiled ironically on hearing that the 
sovereign was the that he had in accord with his 
theory he muttered something to himself and in a bass 
voice as self do might have been  fellow or 
 whole affair will be or  absurd will come 
of it prince andrew did not catch what he said 
and would have passed on but introduced him to that 
prince andrew was just back from where the war had 
so glanced so much at prince andrew as past him 
said with a laugh  must have been a fine 
war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from 
which the sound of voices was heard  always inclined 
to be sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by 
the fact that they had dared to and criticize his 
in his from this short interview with prince andrew to 
his was able to form a clear of the man 
was one of those and self men self to the 
point of as only are because only are self on 
the of an abstract that is the knowledge of absolute 
truth a frenchman is self because he himself personally both 
in mind and body as attractive to men and women 
an englishman is self as being a of the best 
state in the world and therefore as an englishman always 
knows what he should do and knows that all he 
does as an englishman is correct an italian is self 
because he is and easily himself and other people a 
russian is self just because he knows nothing and does 
not want to know anything since he does not believe 
that anything can be known the german self is of 
all and more than any other because he that he 
knows the truth he himself has but which is for 
him the absolute truth  was evidently of that sort 
he had a science theory of movements by him from 
the history of the great wars and all he came 
across in the history of more seemed to him absurd 
and in which so many were committed by both sides 
that these wars could not be called wars they did 
not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve 
as material for science  in  had been one 
of those for the plan of that ended in and 
but he did not see the least of the of 
his theory in the of that war on the contrary 
the made from his theory were in his opinion the 
sole cause of the whole and with he would remark 
 i said the whole affair would go to the 
devil was one of those who so love their theory 
that they lose sight of the theory object practical his 
love of theory made him hate everything practical and he 
would not listen to it he was even pleased by 
for resulting from in practice from the theory only to 
him the of his theory  he said a few 
words to prince andrew and about the present war with 
the air of a man who knows that all will 
go wrong and who is not that it should be 
so the of hair sticking up behind and the hastily 
brushed hair on his expressed this most  he passed 
into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of 
his voice were at once heard from there   
   chapter xi   prince andrew eyes 
were still following out of the room when count entered 
hurriedly and nodding to bolkonski but not went into the 
study giving to his adjutant as he went the emperor 
was following him and had hastened on to make some 
and to be ready to receive the sovereign and prince 
andrew went out into the porch where the emperor who 
looked was was talking to him with particular and the 
emperor with his head bent to the left was listening 
with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward evidently wishing 
to end the conversation but the flushed and italian oblivious 
of decorum followed him and continued to speak   
as for the man who this said as the emperor 
the steps and noticing prince andrew scanned his face  
to that person continued desperately apparently unable to restrain himself 
 man who the see no but the or the 
 without heeding the end of the italian remarks and 
as though not hearing them the emperor bolkonski addressed him 
graciously   am very glad to see you go 
in there where they are meeting and wait for me 
 the emperor went into the study he was followed 
by prince peter and baron and the door closed behind 
them prince andrew taking of the emperor accompanied whom he 
had known in into the drawing room where the was 
assembled  prince peter occupied the position as it were 
of chief of the emperor staff he came out of 
the study into the drawing room with some which he 
spread on a table and put questions on which he 
wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present what 
had happened was that news  afterwards to be had 
been received during the night of a movement by the 
french to the  the first to speak was general 
who to meet the difficulty that itself unexpectedly a perfectly 
new position away from the petersburg and moscow the reason 
for this was  he wished to show that he 
too could have an opinion but he that at this 
point the army should and there the it was plain 
that had thought out that plan long ago and now 
it not so much to answer the questions put in 
fact his plan did not answer to himself of the 
opportunity to air it it was one of the millions 
of one as good as another that could be made 
as long as it was quite what character the war 
would take some his others them young count to the 
general views more warmly than anyone else and in the 
course of the drew from his side a well which 
he asked to read to them in these notes suggested 
another scheme different from or plan of in answer to 
suggested an and an attack which he could alone us 
from the present and from the trap  he called 
the in which we were  during all these and 
his   in court relations were silent only contemptuously 
and turned away to show that he would never himself 
by to such nonsense as he was now hearing so 
when prince who was in the chair called on him 
to give his opinion he merely said   ask 
me general has a splendid position with an exposed or 
why not this italian attack fine or a also good 
why ask me said he  you know everything better 
than i do  but when said with a frown 
that it was in the emperor name that he asked 
his opinion rose and suddenly growing animated began to speak 
  has been spoiled everything everybody thought they knew 
better than i did and now you come to me 
how matters there is nothing to the laid down by 
me must be to said he on the table with 
his bony fingers  is the difficulty nonsense  he 
went up to the map and speaking rapidly began that 
no could the of the that everything had been and 
that if the were really going to it the would 
be destroyed  who did not know german began him 
in french came to the of his chief who spoke 
french badly and began translating for him hardly able to 
keep with who was rapidly that not only all that 
had happened but all that could happen had been in 
his scheme and that if there were now any difficulties 
the whole lay in the fact that his plan had 
not been precisely he kept laughing he and at last 
contemptuously ceased to like a who to prove in the 
of a problem that has already been took his place 
and continued to explain his views in french every now 
and then turning to and saying  it not so 
your excellency but like a man in a fight who 
those on his own side shouted angrily at his own 
  of course what more is there to explain 
 and both attacked in french addressed in german explained 
to in russian prince andrew listened and observed in silence 
 of all these men prince andrew most with angry 
determined and self as he was of all those present 
evidently he alone was not anything for himself no hatred 
against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on 
a theory arrived at by years of should be carried 
out he was and sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary 
respect by his devotion to an idea besides this the 
remarks of all except had one common that had not 
been at the of war in  there was now 
a fear of napoleon which though was in every rejoinder 
everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected 
him from every side and his terrible name to each 
other alone seemed to consider napoleon a like everyone else 
who his theory but besides this feeling of respect evoked 
pity in prince andrew from the tone in which the 
addressed him and the way had allowed himself to speak 
of him to the emperor but above all from a 
certain desperation in own expressions it was clear that the 
others knew and himself felt that his fall was at 
hand and despite his self and german he was with 
his hair smoothly brushed on the and sticking up in 
behind though he the fact under a show of irritation 
and he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining 
of his theory by a huge experiment and its to 
the whole world was slipping away from him  the 
continued a long time and the longer they the more 
became the in shouts and and the less was it 
possible to arrive at any general from all that had 
been said prince andrew listening to this talk and to 
these surmises and shouts felt nothing but amazement at what 
they were saying a thought that had long since and 
often occurred to him during his military idea that there 
is not and cannot be any science of war and 
that therefore there can be no such thing as a 
military appeared to him an obvious truth  theory and 
science is possible about a matter the and circumstances of 
which are and cannot be especially when the strength of 
the forces cannot be no one was or is able 
to in what condition our or the will be in 
a day time and no one can the force of 
this or that sometimes there is not a at the 
front to  are cut off and start running but 
a and lad who shouts  of five thousand is 
worth thirty thousand as at while at times fifty thousand 
run from eight thousand as at what science can there 
be in a matter in which as in all practical 
matters nothing can be and everything depends on the of 
which is determined at a particular moment which no one 
knows when says our army is cut in half and 
says we have got the french army between two says 
that the of the lies in having the river behind 
it and says that is what constitutes its strength one 
plan another and they are all good and all bad 
and the advantages of any can be seen only at 
the moment of and why do they all speak of 
a  is a man a who can order to 
be brought up at the right time and say who 
is to go to the right and who to the 
left it is only because military men are with and 
power and of power to it qualities of it does 
not the best i have known were on the contrary 
stupid or absent men was the best napoleon himself that 
and of bonaparte himself i remember his self face on 
the field of not only does a good army commander 
not need any special qualities on the contrary he the 
of the highest and best human tenderness and inquiring doubt 
he should be firmly convinced that what he is doing 
is very important  he will not have sufficient patience 
and only then will he be a god forbid that 
he should be should love or pity or think of 
what is just and it is that a theory of 
their  was for them long ago because they have 
power the success of a military depends not on them 
but on the man in the ranks who shouts  
are lost or who shouts  and only in the 
ranks can one serve with assurance of being  so 
thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and 
he roused himself only when called him and everyone was 
leaving  at the next day the emperor asked prince 
andrew where he would like to serve and prince andrew 
lost his standing in court forever by not asking to 
remain attached to the sovereign person but for to serve 
in the army      chapter xii 
  before the beginning of the rostov had received 
a letter from his parents in which they told him 
of natasha illness and the breaking off of her to 
prince andrew  they explained by natasha having him and 
again asked nicholas to retire from the army and return 
home on receiving this letter nicholas did not even make 
any to get leave of or to retire from the 
army but wrote to his parents that he was sorry 
natasha was ill and her broken off and that he 
would do all he could to meet their wishes to 
sonya he wrote separately   friend of my soul 
he wrote  but honor could keep me from returning 
to the country but now at the of the i 
should feel not only in my comrades eyes but in 
my own if i my own happiness to my love 
and duty to the but this shall be our last 
believe me the war is over if i am still 
and still loved by you i will throw up everything 
and fly to you to press you forever to my 
breast  it was in fact only the of the 
that prevented rostov from returning home as he had promised 
and marrying sonya the in with the hunting and the 
winter with the and sonya love had opened out to 
him a of joys and peace such as he had 
never known before and which now him  splendid wife 
children a good of a of neighbors service by thought 
he but now the was beginning and he had to 
remain with his regiment and since it had to be 
so nicholas rostov as was natural to him felt with 
the life he led in the regiment and was able 
to find pleasure in that life  on his return 
from his nicholas having been joyfully by his comrades was 
sent to obtain and brought back from the excellent horses 
which pleased him and him commendation from his during his 
he had been captain and when the regiment was put 
on war footing with an increase in he was again 
his old  the began the regiment was moved into 
on pay new officers arrived new men and horses and 
above all everybody was with the merrily mood that goes 
with the of a war and rostov conscious of his 
advantageous position in the regiment devoted himself entirely to the 
and interests of military service though he knew that sooner 
or later he would have to them  the from 
for reasons of state political and each step of the 
was accompanied by a of interests and at for the 
pavlograd hussars however the whole of this during the period 
of summer and with sufficient was a very simple and 
agreeable business  it was only at that there was 
and in the body of the army they did not 
ask themselves where they were going or why if they 
having to it was only because they had to leave 
they had grown accustomed to or some pretty young lady 
if the thought that things looked bad to enter anyone 
head he tried to be as cheerful as a good 
and not to think of the general of affairs but 
only of the task to hand first they gaily before 
making acquaintance with the preparing for and being by the 
emperor and other high then came an order to to 
and any they could not carry away with them was 
remembered by the hussars only as the drunken a name 
the whole army gave to their there and because many 
were made against the who taking of the order to 
took also horses carriages and from the rostov remembered because 
on the first day of their arrival at that small 
town he changed his major and was unable to manage 
all the drunken men of his who to him had 
five of old from they farther and farther to and 
again drawing near to the of russia proper  on 
the of july the took part in a serious for 
the first time  on the of july on the 
of that there was a heavy of rain and in 
general the summer of  was for its  the 
two pavlograd were on a field of which was already 
in but had been completely trodden down by cattle and 
horses the rain was in and rostov with a young 
officer named his was sitting in a hastily an officer 
of their regiment with long onto his who after to 
the staff had been by the rain entered rostov  
 have come from the staff count have you heard 
of  and the officer gave them of the battle 
which he had heard at the staff  rostov smoking 
his pipe and turning his head about as the water 
down his neck listened with an glance at who was 
pressing close to him this officer a lad of sixteen 
who had recently joined the regiment was now in the 
same relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to seven 
years before tried to rostov in everything and adored him 
as a girl might have done  the officer with 
the long mustache spoke of the being  russian and 
of how a deed worthy of had been performed by 
general he how had led his two sons onto the 
under fire and had with them beside him rostov heard 
the story and not only said nothing to enthusiasm but 
on the contrary looked like a man ashamed of what 
he was hearing though with no intention of it since 
the of and of  rostov knew by experience that 
men always lie when military as he himself had done 
when them besides that he had experience enough to know 
that nothing happens in war at all as we can 
imagine or it and so he did not like tale 
nor did he like himself who with his over his 
bent low over the face of his as was his 
habit and crowded rostov in the rostov looked at him 
in silence  the first place there must have been 
such a and crowding on the that was being attacked 
that if did lead his sons there it could have 
had no effect except perhaps on some men to him 
thought he  rest could not have seen how or 
with whom came onto the and even those who did 
see it would not have been much by it for 
what had they to do with tender when their own 
were in danger and besides the fate of the did 
not on whether they took the or not as we 
are told was the case at so why should he 
have made such a sacrifice and why his own children 
in the battle i would not have taken my brother 
petya there or even who a stranger to me but 
a nice lad but would have tried to put them 
somewhere under nicholas continued to think as he listened to 
but he did not express his thoughts for in such 
matters too he had gained experience he knew that this 
tale to the glory of our arms and so one 
had to not to doubt it and he acted  
 can stand this any more said noticing that rostov 
did not conversation  stockings and shirt and the water 
is running on my seat i go and look for 
the rain seems less heavy  went out and away 
 five minutes later through the came running back to 
the   rostov come quick i found it about 
two hundred away there a where ours have already gathered 
we can at least get dry there and mary there 
 mary was the wife of the doctor a pretty 
young german woman he had married in the doctor whether 
from lack of means or because he did not like 
to part from his young wife in the early days 
of their took her about with him wherever the hussar 
regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke 
among the hussar officers  rostov threw his cloak over 
his shoulders shouted to to follow with the things and 
slipping in the now right through it off with in 
the rain and the that was occasionally by   
where are you   what they called to one 
another      chapter xiii   
in the before which stood the doctor covered there were 
already some five officers mary a plump little german in 
a jacket and was sitting on a broad in the 
front corner her husband the doctor lay behind her rostov 
and on entering the room were with merry shouts and 
laughter   me how we are said rostov laughing 
  why do you stand there   they 
are why the water from them don make our drawing 
room so   mess mary dress cried other voices 
 rostov and hastened to find a corner where they 
could change into dry clothes without mary they were going 
into a tiny behind a to change but found it 
completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by 
the light of a on an empty box and these 
officers would on no account their position mary them with 
the of a to be used as a and behind 
that rostov and helped by who had brought their changed 
their things for dry ones  a fire was made 
up in the a board was found fixed on two 
and covered with a a small samovar was produced and 
a and half a bottle of rum and having asked 
mary to they all crowded round her one offered her 
a clean handkerchief to her charming hands another spread a 
jacket under her little feet to keep them from the 
another his coat over the window to keep out the 
and yet another waved the off her husband face he 
should up   him alone said mary smiling timidly 
and  is well as it is after a night 
  no mary replied the officer  must look 
after the doctor perhaps he take pity on me when 
it comes to off a or an arm for me 
 there were only three the water was so that 
one could not make out whether the tea was strong 
or weak and the samovar held only six of water 
but this made it all the to take in order 
of to receive one tumbler from mary plump little hands 
with their short and not all the officers appeared to 
be and really were in love with her that evening 
even those playing cards behind the soon left their game 
and came over to the samovar to the general mood 
of mary she seeing herself by such brilliant and polite 
young men beamed with satisfaction try as she might to 
hide it and as she evidently was each time her 
husband moved in his sleep behind her  there was 
only one was more than anything else but it took 
too long to so it was decided that mary should 
stir the for everyone in turn rostov received his tumbler 
and adding some rum to it asked mary to stir 
it   you take it without she said smiling 
all the time as if everything she said and everything 
the others said was very amusing and had a meaning 
  is not the i want but only that 
your little hand should stir my tea  mary and 
began looking for the which someone meanwhile had on  
 your finger mary it will be still said rostov 
  hot she replied blushing with pleasure  put 
a few of rum into the of water and brought 
it to mary asking her to stir it with her 
finger   is my cup said he  your 
finger in it and i drink it all up  
when they had the samovar rostov took a of cards 
and that they should play  with mary they drew 
to who should make up her set at rostov it 
was agreed that whoever became  should have the right 
to kiss mary hand and that the  should go 
to and the samovar for the doctor when the latter 
  but mary is  asked   it 
is she is queen and her word is law  
they had hardly to play before the doctor head suddenly 
appeared from behind mary he had been for some time 
listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing 
or amusing in what was going on his face was 
sad and depressed without greeting the officers he himself and 
asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking 
the way as soon as he had left the room 
all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary blushed 
till her eyes filled with tears and became still more 
attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told 
his wife  had ceased to smile so and looked 
at him in alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain 
had ceased and they must go to sleep in their 
covered or everything in it would be   i 
send an two of them said rostov  an idea 
doctor   stand on it myself said   
gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not 
for two replied the doctor and he sat down beside 
his wife waiting for the game to end  seeing 
his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the 
officers grew still and some of them could not refrain 
from laughter for which they hurriedly when he had gone 
taking his wife with him and had settled down with 
her in their covered the officers lay down in the 
themselves with their cloaks but they did not sleep for 
a long time now they exchanged remarks the doctor and 
his wife now they ran out into the porch and 
what was taking place in the covered trap several times 
rostov his head tried to go to sleep but some 
remark would him and conversation would be resumed to the 
of merry childlike laughter      chapter 
xiv   it was nearly three o but no 
one was yet when the appeared with an order to 
move on to the little town of still laughing and 
talking the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again some 
water in the samovar but rostov went off to his 
without waiting for tea day was breaking the rain had 
ceased and the were it felt and cold especially in 
clothes that were still as they left the in the 
of the dawn rostov and both glanced under the and 
of the doctor from under the of which his feet 
were sticking out and in the middle of which his 
wife was visible and her sleepy breathing audible   
really is a dear little thing said rostov to who 
was following him   charming woman said with all 
the gravity of a boy of sixteen  half an 
hour later the was up on the road the command 
was heard to  and the soldiers themselves and rostov 
in front gave the order  and the hussars with 
and subdued talk their horses in the in and moved 
along the broad road with on each side following the 
infantry and a that had gone on in front  
tattered blue in the east were before the wind it 
was growing and that curly grass which always by country 
became clearly visible still with the night rain the drooping 
branches of the also swayed in the wind and down 
bright of water to one side the soldiers faces were 
more and more clearly visible rostov always followed by along 
the side of the road between two rows of  
when rostov allowed himself the of not a but a 
cossack horse a judge of horses and a he had 
lately himself a large fine horse with light and tail 
and when he it no one could him to ride 
this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought 
of the horse of the morning of the doctor wife 
but not once of the danger  when going into 
rostov had felt afraid now he had not the least 
feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had 
grown used to being under fire  cannot grow used 
to danger but because he had learned how to manage 
his thoughts when in danger he had grown accustomed when 
going into to think about anything but what would seem 
most likely to interest him danger during the first period 
of his service hard as he tried and much as 
he himself with he had not been able to do 
this but with time it had come of itself now 
he beside under the occasionally leaves from a that met 
his hand sometimes touching his horse side with his foot 
or without turning round a pipe he had finished to 
an hussar behind him with as calm and careless an 
air as though he were merely out for a ride 
he glanced with pity at the face of who talked 
much and in great agitation he knew from experience the 
of and death the cornet was suffering and knew that 
only time could help him  as soon as the 
sun appeared in a clear of sky beneath the the 
wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty 
of the summer morning after the still continued to fall 
but now and all was still the whole sun appeared 
on the and behind a long cloud that above it 
a few minutes later it still from behind the top 
of the cloud its edge everything grew bright and and 
with that light and as if in reply to it 
came the sound of of them  before rostov had 
had time to consider and the distance of that count 
adjutant came from with orders to at a along the 
road  the overtook and passed the infantry and the 
had also their down a hill and passing through an 
empty and deserted village again ascended the horses began to 
and the men to   dress your ranks the 
order of the commander was heard  by the left 
walk march came the order from in front  and 
the hussars passing along the line of on the left 
of our position behind our who were in the front 
line to the right stood our infantry in a they 
were the reserve higher up the hill on the very 
our were visible through the clear air by morning in 
front a hollow could be seen the and our line 
already in could be heard briskly exchanging with the in 
the  at these sounds long rostov rose as at 
the strains of the music trap cracked the now together 
now several quickly one after another again all was silent 
and then again it sounded as if someone were on 
and them  the hussars remained in the same place 
for about an hour a began count with his up 
behind the spoke to the commander of the regiment and 
up the hill to the  after had gone a 
command rang out to the   prepare to  
the infantry in front of them into to allow the 
cavalry to pass the started the on their and toward 
the french cavalry which was seen below to the left 
 as soon as the the hill the hussars were 
ordered up the hill to support the as they took 
the places by the came from the front and but 
fell spent without taking effect  the sounds which he 
had not heard for so long had an even more 
and effect on rostov than the previous sounds of drawing 
himself up he the field of battle opening out before 
him from the hill and with his whole soul followed 
the movement of the they down close to the french 
something confused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes 
later our were back not to the place they had 
occupied but more to the left and among the on 
horses and behind them in a large group blue french 
on gray horses could be seen     
 chapter xv   rostov with his eye was 
one of the first to catch sight of these blue 
french our nearer and nearer in came the and the 
french them he could already see how these men who 
looked so small at the foot of the hill and 
overtook one another their arms and their in the air 
 rostov gazed at what was before him as at 
a hunt he felt that if the hussars struck at 
the french now the latter could not them but if 
a was to be made it must be done now 
at that very moment or it would be too late 
he looked around a captain standing beside him was gazing 
like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them 
  said rostov  know we could crush them 
  fine thing too replied the captain  really 
 rostov without waiting to hear him out touched his 
horse to the front of his and before he had 
time to finish giving the word of command the whole 
sharing his feeling was following him rostov himself did not 
know how or why he did it he acted as 
he did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw 
the near and that they were in he knew they 
could not an attack there was only that moment and 
that if he let it slip it would not return 
the were and so around him and his horse was 
so eager to go that he could not restrain himself 
he touched his horse gave the word of command and 
immediately hearing behind him the of the horses of his 
at full toward the hardly had they reached the bottom 
of the hill before their changed to a which grew 
and as they drew nearer to our and the french 
who after them the were now close at hand on 
seeing the hussars the began to turn while those behind 
began to halt with the same feeling with which he 
had across the path of a rostov gave to his 
horse and to the path of the lines one stopped 
another who was on foot himself to the ground to 
avoid being over and a horse fell in among the 
hussars nearly all the french were back rostov picking out 
one on a gray horse dashed after him on the 
way he came upon a his horse it and almost 
before he had himself in his he saw that he 
would immediately the he had that frenchman by his uniform 
an officer was going at a on his gray horse 
and it on with his saber in another moment rostov 
horse dashed its breast against the of the officer horse 
almost it over and at the same instant rostov without 
knowing why raised his saber and struck the frenchman with 
it  the instant he had done this all rostov 
animation vanished the officer fell not so much from the 
blow had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow 
from the to his horse and from rostov in his 
horse and his eyes his foe to see whom he 
had the french officer was with one foot on the 
ground the other being caught in the his eyes screwed 
up with fear as if he every moment expected another 
blow gazed up at rostov with his pale and face 
and young with a in the and light eyes not 
an face at all to a but a most ordinary 
face before rostov had decided what to do with him 
the officer cried  he hurriedly but tried to get 
his foot out of the and did not his frightened 
blue eyes from rostov face some hussars who up his 
foot and helped him into the on all sides the 
hussars were busy with the one was but though his 
face was he would not give up his horse another 
was up behind an hussar with his arms round him 
a third was being helped by an hussar to his 
horse in front the french infantry were as they ran 
the hussars hastily back with their prisoners rostov back with 
the rest aware of an unpleasant feeling of in his 
heart something and confused which he could not at all 
account for had come over him with the of that 
officer and the blow he had him  count met 
the returning hussars sent for rostov thanked him and said 
he would report his deed to the emperor and would 
recommend him for a st george cross when sent for 
by count rostov that he had without orders felt sure 
his commander was sending for him to him for of 
words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck 
him all the more but he still felt that same 
disagreeable feeling of  what on earth is me he 
asked himself as he back from the general  no 
he safe have i myself in any way no that 
not it something else tormented him  oh yes that 
french officer with the and i remember how my arm 
paused when i raised it  rostov saw the prisoners 
being led away and after them to have a look 
at his frenchman with the on his he was sitting 
in his foreign uniform on an hussar and looked anxiously 
about him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely 
be called a wound he glanced at rostov with a 
feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting rostov still 
had the same feeling as of shame  all that 
day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that 
rostov without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and 
he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning 
something over in his mind  rostov was always thinking 
about that brilliant of his which to his amazement had 
gained him the st george cross and even given him 
a reputation for and there was something he could not 
at all understand  others are even more afraid than 
i am he thought  that all there is in 
what is called and did i do it for my 
country sake and how was he to with his and 
blue eyes and how frightened he was he thought that 
i should kill him why should i kill him my 
hand trembled and they have given me a st george 
cross i can make it out at all  but 
while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach 
no clear of what him so the of fortune in 
the service as often happens turned in his favor after 
the affair at he was brought into notice received command 
of an hussar and when a officer was he was 
     chapter xvi   on 
receiving news of natasha illness the countess though not quite 
well yet and still weak went to moscow with petya 
and the rest of the household and the whole family 
moved from marya dmitrievna house to their own and settled 
down in town  natasha illness was so serious that 
for her and for her parents the consideration of all 
that had the illness her conduct and the breaking off 
of her into the she was so ill that it 
was impossible for them to consider in how far she 
was to for what had happened she could not eat 
or sleep grew and as the doctors made them feel 
was in danger they could not think of anything but 
how to help her doctors came to see her singly 
and in talked much in french german and latin one 
another and a great of for all the known to 
them but the simple idea never occurred to any of 
them that they could not know the natasha was suffering 
from as no by a live man can be known 
for every living person has his own and always has 
his own peculiar to a of the skin heart and 
so on mentioned in but a of one of the 
of the of those this simple thought could not occur 
to the doctors  it cannot occur to a that 
he is unable to work his because the business of 
their lives was to and they received money for it 
and had spent the best years of their lives on 
that business but above all that thought was kept out 
of their minds by the fact that they saw they 
were really as in fact they were to the whole 
rostov family their did not on making the patient swallow 
for the most part  was scarcely perceptible as they 
were given in small but they were necessary and because 
they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of 
those who loved her that is why there are and 
always will be women and they satisfied that human need 
for hope of relief for sympathy and that something should 
be done which is felt by those who are suffering 
they satisfied the need seen in its most form in 
a child when it wants to have a place rubbed 
that has been hurt a child itself and at once 
to the arms of its mother or nurse to have 
the spot rubbed or kissed and it better when this 
is done the child cannot believe that the and of 
its people have no for its and the hope of 
relief and the expression of its mother sympathy while she 
the bump it the doctors were of use to natasha 
because they kissed and rubbed her bump her that it 
would soon pass if only the went to the in 
the and got a and some in a pretty box 
for a and and if she took those in water 
at of precisely two hours neither more nor less  
what would sonya and the count and countess have done 
how would they have looked if nothing had been done 
if there had not been those to give by the 
clock the warm drinks the and all the other of 
life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which 
an occupation and to the family circle how would the 
count have his loved daughter illness had he not known 
that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that 
he would not thousands more to her or had he 
not known that if her illness continued he would not 
yet other thousands and would take her abroad for there 
and had he not been able to explain the of 
how and had not understood the but had and had 
them even better what would the countess have done had 
she not been able sometimes to the invalid for not 
the doctor orders   never get well like that 
she would say forgetting her in her vexation  you 
won obey the doctor and take your at the right 
time you with it you know or it may turn 
to she would go on much from the of that 
foreign word to others as well as to herself  
what would sonya have done without the glad consciousness that 
she had not during the first three in order to 
be ready to carry out all the doctor with precision 
and that she still kept at night so as not 
to miss the proper time when the slightly in the 
little box had to be even to natasha herself it 
was pleasant to see that so many were being made 
for her sake and to know that she had to 
take at certain hours though she declared that no would 
her and that it was all nonsense and it was 
even pleasant to be able to show by the orders 
that she did not believe in and did not value 
her life  the doctor came every day felt her 
looked at her tongue and of her face with her 
but when he had gone into another room to which 
the countess hurriedly followed him he assumed a grave air 
and shaking his head said that though there was danger 
he had of the effect of this last and one 
must wait and see that the was chiefly mental but 
and the countess trying to the from herself and from 
him slipped a gold into his hand and always returned 
to the patient with a more mind  the of 
natasha illness were that she ate little little and was 
always low the doctors said that she could not get 
on without so they kept her in the of the 
town and the rostovs did not move to the country 
that summer of   in spite of the many 
she and the and out of the little bottles and 
of which madame who was fond of such things made 
a large collection and in spite of being of the 
country life to which she was accustomed youth natasha began 
to be by the of life it ceased to press 
so on her heart it gradually faded into the past 
and she began to physically      
chapter xvii   natasha was calmer but no happier 
she not merely all of pleasure and she never laughed 
without a sound of tears in her laughter she could 
not sing as soon as she began to laugh or 
tried to sing by herself tears her tears of tears 
at the of those times which could never return tears 
of vexation that she should so have her young life 
which might have been so happy laughter and in particular 
seemed to her like a in face of her sorrow 
without any need of self no wish to ever entered 
her head she said and felt at that time that 
no man was more to her than ivanovna the something 
stood within her and her every joy besides she had 
lost all the old interests of her girlish life that 
had been so full of hope the previous the hunting 
 and the spent with nicholas at were what she 
recalled and most what would she not have given to 
bring back even a single day of that time but 
it was gone forever her at the time had not 
her that state of freedom and for any enjoyment would 
not return again yet it was necessary to live on 
 it her to that she was not better as 
she had imagined but worse much worse than anybody else 
in the world but this was not enough she knew 
that and asked herself  next but there was nothing 
to come there was no joy in life yet life 
was passing natasha apparently tried not to be a burden 
or a to anyone but wanted nothing for herself she 
kept away from everyone in the house and felt at 
ease only with her brother petya she liked to be 
with him better than with the others and when alone 
with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever left the 
house and of those who came to see them was 
glad to see only one person pierre it would have 
been impossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care 
and at the same time more seriously than did count 
bezukhov natasha felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure 
in his society but she was not even grateful to 
him for it nothing good on pierre part seemed to 
her to be an effort it seemed so natural for 
him to be kind to everyone that there was no 
in his kindness sometimes natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on 
his part in her presence especially when he wanted to 
do something to please her or feared that something they 
spoke of would to her she noticed this and it 
to his general kindness and which she imagined must be 
the same toward everyone as it was to her after 
those involuntary words if he were free he would have 
asked on his knees for her hand and her love 
at a moment when she was so strongly agitated pierre 
never spoke to natasha of his and it seemed plain 
to her that those words which had then so her 
were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken 
to a crying child it was not because pierre was 
a married man but because natasha felt very strongly with 
him that the of which she had experienced with kuragin 
that it never entered her head that the relations between 
him and herself could lead to love on her part 
still less on his or even to the kind of 
tender self friendship between a man and a woman of 
which she had known several  before the end of 
the fast of st peter ivanovna a country of the 
rostovs came to moscow to pay her at the of 
the moscow she suggested that natasha should fast and prepare 
for and natasha the idea despite the doctor orders that 
she should not go out early in the morning natasha 
on and preparing for the not as they generally prepared 
for it in the rostov family by three in their 
own house but as ivanovna did by going to every 
day for a week and not once missing or  
the countess was pleased with natasha after the poor of 
the in the of her heart she that might help 
her daughter more than and though not without fear and 
concealing it from the doctor she agreed to natasha wish 
and her to ivanovna used to come to natasha at 
three in the morning but generally found her already she 
was afraid of being late for hastily and putting on 
her dress and an old mantilla natasha in the fresh 
air went out into the deserted lit by the clear 
light of dawn by ivanovna advice natasha prepared herself not 
in their own but at a where to the ivanovna 
the was a man of very severe and lofty life 
there were never many people in the natasha always stood 
beside in the place before an of the let into 
the before the on the left side and a feeling 
new to her of before something great and seized her 
when at that morning hour gazing at the dark face 
of the by the candles burning before it and by 
the morning light falling from the window she listened to 
the words of the service which she tried to follow 
with understanding when she understood them her feeling became in 
the with of its own when she did not understand 
it was still to think that the wish to understand 
everything is pride that it is impossible to understand all 
that it is only necessary to believe and to commit 
to god whom she felt her soul at those moments 
she herself bowed low and when she did not understand 
in horror at her own simply asked god to forgive 
her everything everything to have mercy upon her the to 
which she herself most of all were those of on 
her way home at an early hour when she met 
no one but going to work or men the street 
and everybody within the was still natasha experienced a feeling 
new to her a sense of the of her the 
of a new clean life and of happiness  during 
the whole week she spent in this way that feeling 
grew every day and the happiness of taking or  
as ivanovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed 
to natasha so great that she felt she should never 
live till that  but the happy day came and 
on that when dressed in white muslin she returned home 
after for the first time for many months she felt 
calm and not by the thought of the life that 
lay before her  the doctor who came to see 
her that day ordered her to continue the he had 
a   must certainly go on taking them morning 
and evening said he evidently sincerely satisfied with his success 
 please be particular about it   quite easy 
he continued playfully as he took the gold in his 
palm  will soon be and about the last has 
done her a very great deal of good she has 
up very much  the countess with a cheerful expression 
on her face looked down at her and a little 
for luck as she returned to the drawing room  
    chapter xviii   at the 
beginning of july more and more reports about the war 
began to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal 
by the emperor to the people and of his coming 
himself from the army to moscow and as up to 
the of july no manifesto or appeal had been received 
exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position 
of russia it was said that the emperor was leaving 
the army because it was in danger it was said 
that had that napoleon had an army of a million 
and only a could save russia  on the of 
july which was the manifesto was received but was not 
yet in and pierre who was at the rostovs promised 
to come to dinner next day and bring a copy 
of the manifesto and appeal which he would obtain from 
count  that the rostovs went to at the razumovskis 
private as usual it was a hot july day even 
at ten o when the rostovs got out of their 
carriage at the the air the shouts of the light 
and gay summer clothes of the crowd the leaves of 
the on the the sounds of the band and the 
white of a to the of wheels on the and 
the brilliant hot were all full of that summer languor 
that and with the present which is most strongly felt 
on a bright hot day in town all the moscow 
all the rostovs were at the razumovskis for as if 
expecting something to happen many wealthy families who usually left 
town for their country estates had not gone away that 
summer as natasha at her mother side passed through the 
crowd behind a footman who the way for them she 
heard a young man speaking about her in too loud 
a whisper   rostova the one who   
much but all the same she pretty  she heard 
or thought she heard the of kuragin and bolkonski but 
she was always that it always seemed to her that 
everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what 
had happened to her with a heart wretched as she 
always was now when she found herself in a crowd 
natasha in her silk dress trimmed with black lace walked 
women can walk the more and the greater the and 
shame in her soul she knew for certain that she 
was pretty but this no longer gave her satisfaction as 
it used to on the contrary it tormented her more 
than anything else of late and particularly so on this 
bright hot summer day in town  again week past 
she thought that she had been here the before  
always the same life that is no life and the 
same in which it used to be so easy to 
live i pretty i young and i know that now 
i am good i used to be bad but now 
i know i am good she thought  yet my 
best years are slipping by and are no good to 
anyone she stood by her mother side and exchanged with 
near her from habit she the ladies dresses the bearing 
of a lady standing close by who was not crossing 
herself properly but in a manner and again she thought 
with vexation that she was herself being and was others 
and suddenly at the sound of the service she felt 
at her own that the former of her soul was 
again lost to her  a fresh old man was 
the service with that solemnity which has so and an 
effect on the of the the of the were closed 
the was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft 
voice some words tears the cause of which she herself 
did not understand made natasha breast and a joyous but 
feeling agitated her   me what i should do 
how to live my life how i may grow good 
forever forever she  the came out onto the raised 
space before the and holding his drew his long hair 
from under his and making the sign of the cross 
on his breast began in a loud and solemn voice 
to the words of the   peace let us 
the   one without of class without by love 
us thought natasha   the peace that is from 
above and for the of our   the world 
of and all the who above us natasha  when 
they for the she thought of her brother and when 
they for all by land and sea she remembered prince 
andrew for him and asked god to forgive her all 
the she had done him when they for those who 
love us she for the members of her own family 
her father and mother and sonya for the first time 
how she had acted toward them and feeling all the 
strength of her love for them when they for those 
who hate us she tried to think of her and 
people who her in order to for them she among 
her the and all who had business with her father 
and always at the thought of and those who her 
she remembered anatole who had done her so much though 
he did not hate her she for him as for 
an only at did she feel able to think clearly 
and of prince andrew and anatole as men for whom 
her were as nothing with her and devotion to god 
when they for the imperial family and the she bowed 
very low and made the sign of the cross saying 
to herself that even if she did not understand still 
she could not doubt and at any rate loved the 
and for it  when he had finished the the 
the over his breast and said  us commit ourselves 
and our whole lives to the   ourselves to 
god natasha repeated  god i myself to will she 
thought  want nothing wish for nothing me what to 
do and how to use my will take me take 
me natasha with impatient in her heart not crossing herself 
but letting her slender arms down as if expecting some 
invisible power at any moment to take her and her 
from herself from her desires and  the countess looked 
round several times at her daughter face and shining eyes 
and god to help her  unexpectedly in the middle 
of the service and not in the usual order natasha 
knew so well the brought out a small the one 
he on when on and placed it before the doors 
of the the came out with his velvet on his 
head adjusted his hair and down with an effort everybody 
followed his example and they looked at one another in 
surprise then came the just received from the for the 
of russia from   god of might god of

nations know that art the and we are people show 
mercy upon us this day o and grant us make 
the hearts of to rejoice in mercy down our and 
them swiftly beneath the feet of faithful for art the 
defense the and the of them that put their in

and ghost now and forever world without end  in 
natasha condition of soul this affected her strongly she listened 
to every word about the of over of over and 
of over and about the of  and she to 
god with the tenderness and with which her heart was 
but without fully understanding what she was asking of god 
in that she with all her heart in the for 
the spirit of for the of the heart by faith 
and hope and its animation by love but she could 
not that her might be under foot when but a 
few minutes before she had been wishing she had more 
of them that she might for them but neither could 
she doubt the of the that was being read on 
knees she felt in her heart a and at the 
thought of the that men for their and especially of 
her own and she to god to forgive them all 
and her too and to give them all and her 
too peace and happiness and it seemed to her that 
god heard her      chapter xix 
  from the day when pierre after leaving the 
rostovs with natasha grateful look fresh in his mind had 
gazed at the that seemed to be fixed in the 
sky and felt that something new was on his own 
that day the problem of the vanity and of all 
earthly things that had tormented him no longer itself that 
terrible question   which had come to him amid 
every occupation was now replaced not by another question or 
by a reply to the former question but by her 
when he listened to or himself took part in trivial 
conversations when he read or heard of human or folly 
he was not as and did not ask himself why 
men so about these things when all is so and 
he remembered her as he had last seen her and 
all his vanished because she had answered the questions that 
had him but because his of her transferred him instantly 
to another a of in which no one could be 
justified or guilty of beauty and love which it was 
worth living for itself to him he said to himself 
  the country and the and the country and 
the upon him what does that matter she smiled at 
me yesterday and asked me to come again and i 
love her and no one will ever know it and 
his soul felt calm and  pierre still went into 
society drank as much and led the same and dissipated 
life because besides the hours he spent at the rostovs 
there were other hours he had to spend somehow and 
the and he had made in moscow formed a current 
that bore him along but when more and more reports 
came from the seat of war and natasha health began 
to and she no longer in him the former feeling 
of pity an ever which he could not explain took 
of him he felt that the condition he was in 
could not continue long that a was coming which would 
change his whole life and he everywhere for signs of 
that approaching one of his brother had revealed to pierre 
the following napoleon drawn from the of st  in 
chapter   of the it is said   
here is let him that understanding count the number of 
the for it is the number of a man and 
his number is six hundred and six  and in 
the of the same chapter   and there was 
given him a mouth speaking great things and and power 
was given him to continue forty and two months  
 the french written out with the same as the 
in which the first nine and the others tens will 
have the following        
a       d   
  f       i

         the 
words l napoleon in it that the sum of them 
is  and that napoleon was therefore the in the 
moreover by applying the same system to the words  
which was the allowed to the that  great things 
and the same number  was obtained from which it 
followed that the fixed for napoleon power had come in 
the year  when the french emperor was forty this 
pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what 
would put an end to the power of the that 
is of napoleon and tried by the same system of 
using as and adding them up to find an answer 
to the question that him he wrote the words l 
la nation and added up their but the were either 
more or less than  once when making such he 
wrote down his own name in french pierre but the 
sum of the did not come right then he changed 
the a for the and adding de and the le 
still without the desired result then it occurred to him 
if the answer to the question were in his name 
his would also be given in the answer so he 
wrote le and adding up the got  this was 
only five too much and five was by the very 
letter from the le before the word by omitting the 
though pierre got the answer he l made  this 
him how or by what means he was connected with 
the great in the he did not know but he 
did not doubt that connection for a moment his love 
for natasha antichrist napoleon the the  l napoleon and 
l this had to and to lift him out of 
that of moscow in which he felt himself held and 
lead him to a great and great happiness   
     forty   on the 
of the when the special was read pierre had promised 
the rostovs to bring them from count whom he knew 
well both the appeal to the people and the news 
from the army in the morning when he went to 
call at he met there a courier fresh from the 
army an acquaintance of his own who often danced at 
moscow balls   please for heaven sake relieve me 
of something said the courier  have a of to 
parents  among these was one from nicholas rostov to 
his father pierre took that letter and also gave him 
the emperor appeal to moscow which had just been the 
last army orders and his own most glancing through the 
army orders pierre found in one of them in the 
of killed and the name of nicholas rostov a st 
george cross of the fourth class for courage shown in 
the affair and in the same order the name of 
prince andrew bolkonski appointed to the command of a regiment 
of though he did not want to the rostovs of 
bolkonski pierre could not refrain from making them happy by 
the news of their son having received a so he 
sent that army order and nicholas letter to the rostovs 
keeping the appeal the and the other orders to take 
with him when he went to dinner  his conversation 
with count and the latter tone of anxious the meeting 
with the courier who talked of how badly things were 
going in the army the of the of in moscow 
and of a in that napoleon promised to be in 
both the russian by the and the talk of the 
emperor being expected to arrive next day with fresh force 
that feeling of agitation and in pierre which he had 
been conscious of ever since the appearance of the and 
especially since the beginning of the war  he had 
long been thinking of entering the army and would have 
done so had he not been first by his of 
the society of to which he was by and which 
preached perpetual peace and the of war and by the 
fact that when he saw the great of who had 
uniform and were talking he somehow felt ashamed to take 
the step but the chief reason for not carrying out 
his intention to enter the army lay in the idea 
that he was l who had the number of the 
 that his part in the great affair of setting 
a to the power of the that spoke great and 
things had been from and that therefore he ought not 
to anything but wait for what was to come to 
pass      chapter xx   
a few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that 
day as usual on  pierre came early so as 
to find them alone  he had grown so stout 
this year that he would have been had he not 
been so tall so broad of and so strong that 
he carried his with evident ease  he went up 
the stairs and muttering something his did not even ask 
whether he was to wait he knew that when his 
was at the rostovs he stayed till the rostovs footman 
rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak 
and take his hat and stick pierre from club habit 
always left both hat and stick in the anteroom  
the first person he saw in the house was natasha 
even before he saw her while taking off his cloak 
he heard her she was in the music room he 
knew that she had not since her illness and so 
the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him he 
opened the door softly and saw her in the dress 
she had worn at about the room she had her 
back to him when he opened the door but when 
turning quickly she saw his broad surprised face she blushed 
and came rapidly up to him   want to 
try to sing again she said adding as if by 
way of excuse  is at least something to do 
  capital   glad i am you come 
i am so happy today she said with the old 
animation pierre had not seen in her for a long 
time  know nicholas has received a st george cross 
i am so proud of him   yes i 
sent that but i don want to interrupt you he 
added and was about to go to the drawing room 
 natasha stopped him   is it wrong of 
me to sing she said blushing and her eyes inquiringly 
on him   why should it be on the 
contrary but why do you ask me   don 
know myself natasha answered quickly  i should not like 
to do anything you disapproved of i believe in you 
completely you don know how important you are to me 
how much you done for me she spoke rapidly and 
did not notice how pierre flushed at her words  
saw in that same army order that he bolkonski  
whispered the name hastily  in russia and in the 
army again what do you think was speaking hurriedly evidently 
afraid her strength might her he ever forgive me will 
he not always have a feeling toward me what do 
you think what do you think   think pierre 
replied  he has nothing to forgive if i were 
in his place  by of ideas pierre was at 
once carried back to the day when trying to her 
he had said that if he were not himself but 
the best man in the world and free he would 
ask on his knees for her hand and the same 
feeling of pity tenderness and love took of him and 
the same words rose to his lips but she did 
not give him time to say them   you 
you she said uttering the word you a different thing 
i know no one more or better than you could 
be had you not been there then and now too 
i don know what would have become of me because 
 tears suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away 
lifted her music before her eyes began again and again 
began up and down the room  just then petya 
came running in from the drawing room  petya was 
now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red 
lips and natasha he was preparing to enter the university 
but he and his friend had lately in secret agreed 
to join the hussars  petya had come rushing out 
to talk to his about this affair he had asked 
pierre to find out whether he would be in the 
hussars  pierre walked up and down the drawing room 
not listening to what petya was saying  petya pulled 
him by the arm to attract his attention   
what about my plan peter for heaven sake you are 
my only hope said petya   yes your plan 
to join the hussars i mention it i bring it 
all up today   mon cher have you got 
the manifesto asked the old count  countess has been 
to at the razumovskis and heard the new she says 
it very fine   i got it said pierre 
 emperor is to be here tomorrow there to be 
an extraordinary meeting of the and they are talking of 
a of ten men per thousand oh yes let me 
congratulate you   yes thank god well and what 
news from the army   are again they say 
we already near replied pierre   o exclaimed the 
count  is the manifesto   emperor appeal oh 
yes  pierre began feeling in his for the papers 
but could not find them still slapping his he kissed 
the hand of the countess who entered the room and 
glanced uneasily around evidently expecting natasha who had left off 
but had not yet come into the drawing room  
 my word i don know what i done with 
it he said   he is always losing everything 
remarked the countess  natasha entered with a and agitated 
expression of face and sat down looking silently at pierre 
as soon as she entered pierre features which had been 
gloomy suddenly lighted up and while still searching for the 
papers he glanced at her several times   really 
i drive home i must have left them there i 
certainly   you be late for dinner   
and my has gone  but sonya who had gone 
to look for the papers in the anteroom had found 
them in pierre hat where he had carefully tucked them 
under the pierre was about to begin reading   
after dinner said the old count evidently expecting much enjoyment 
from that reading  at dinner at which champagne was 
drunk to the health of the new of st george 
shinshin told them the town news of the illness of 
the old princess of from moscow and of how some 
german fellow had been brought to and of being a 
french   count had told the story and how 
let him go and the people that he was  
a at all but only an old german   
are being said the count  told the countess she 
should not speak french so much it not the time 
for it now   have you heard shinshin asked 
 golitsyn has engaged a to him russian it is 
becoming dangerous to speak french in the   how 
about you count peter if they call up the you 
too will have to a horse remarked the old count 
addressing pierre  pierre had been silent and all through 
dinner not to what was said he looked at the 
count   yes the war he said  what 
sort of should i make and yet everything is so 
strange so strange i can make it out i don 
know i am very far from having military but in 
these times no one can answer for himself  after 
dinner the count settled himself in an easy chair and 
with a serious face asked sonya who was considered an 
excellent to read the appeal    moscow our 
capital   has entered the of russia with immense 
forces he comes to our country   sonya read 
in her high voice the count listened with closed eyes 
at certain  natasha sat erect gazing with a searching 
look now at her father and now at pierre  
pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to 
look round the countess shook her head and angrily at 
every solemn expression in the manifesto in all these words 
she saw only that the danger threatening her son would 
not soon be over shinshin with a sarcastic smile on 
his lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything 
that gave him the opportunity sonya reading any remark of 
the count or even the manifesto itself should no better 
pretext present itself  after reading about the that russia 
the the emperor placed on moscow and especially on its 
illustrious sonya with a in her voice chiefly to the 
attention that was being paid to her read the last 
words    ourselves will not delay to appear 
among our people in that capital and in other of 
our for and for the direction of all our both 
those now the path and those formed to him wherever 
he may appear may the he to bring upon us 
on his own head and may europe delivered from the 
name of russia    that it cried the 
count opening his eyes and as if a strong had 
been held to his nose and he added  the 
emperor but say the word and we sacrifice everything and 
nothing  before shinshin had time to utter the joke 
he was ready to make on the count natasha jumped 
up from her place and ran to her father  
 a darling our papa is she cried kissing him 
and she again looked at pierre with the coquetry that 
had returned to her with her better   here 
a for you said shinshin   a at all 
but simply natasha replied in an tone  seems funny 
to you but this isn at all a joke  
 joke indeed put in the count  him but 
say the word and we all go we not  
 did you notice it says  said pierre  
 mind what it for  at this moment petya 
to whom was paying any attention came up to his 
father with a very flushed face and said in his 
breaking voice that was now deep and now   
papa i tell you and mamma too it as you 
please but i say that you must let me enter 
the army because i can that all  the countess 
in dismay looked up to heaven clasped her hands and 
turned angrily to her husband   comes of your 
talking said she  but the count had already from 
his excitement   come said he  a fine 
no nonsense you must study   not nonsense papa 
is younger than i and he going too besides all 
the same i can study now when petya stopped short 
flushed till he but still got out the words  
our is in danger   do that do  
 you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything  
 be quiet i tell you cried the count with 
a glance at his wife who had turned pale and 
was staring fixedly at her son   i tell 
you here will also tell you   i tell 
you your mother milk has hardly on your lips and 
you want to go into the army there there i 
tell you and the count moved to go out of 
the room taking the papers probably to them in his 
study before having a nap   peter let go 
and have a smoke he said  pierre was agitated 
and natasha brilliant eyes continually glancing at him with a 
more than look had him to this condition   
i think i go home   why you meant 
to spend the evening with us you don often come 
as it is and this girl of mine said the 
count good pointing to natasha  up when you here 
  i had forgotten i really must go home 
business said pierre hurriedly   then au revoir said 
the count and went out of the room   
are you going why are you upset asked natasha and 
she looked into pierre eyes   i love you 
was what he wanted to say but he did not 
say it and only blushed till the tears came and 
lowered his eyes   it is better for me 
to come less often because no simply i have business 
  no tell me natasha began and suddenly stopped 
 they looked at each other with and faces he 
tried to smile but could not his smile expressed suffering 
and he silently kissed her hand and went out  
pierre made up his mind not to go to the 
rostovs any more      chapter  
 after the definite he had received petya went to 
his room and there himself in and wept bitterly when 
he came in to tea silent and with tear face 
everybody pretended not to notice anything  next day the 
emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostovs serfs 
begged to go to have a look at him that 
morning petya was a long time and arranging his hair 
and collar to look like a grown man he frowned 
before his looking glass shrugged his shoulders and finally without 
saying a word to anyone took his cap and left 
the house by the back door trying to avoid notice 
petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was 
and to explain to some  imagined the emperor to 
be always by gentlemen that he count rostov in spite 
of his youth wished to serve his country that youth 
could be no to and that he was ready to 
while petya had prepared many fine things he meant to 
say to the  it was on the very fact 
of being so young that petya counted for success in 
reaching the emperor even thought how surprised everyone would be 
at his yet in the of his collar and hair 
and by his sedate walk he wished to appear a 
grown man but the farther he went and the more 
his attention was by the ever moving toward the the 
less he remembered to walk with the and of a 
man as he approached the he even began to avoid 
being and stuck out his elbows in a menacing way 
but within the he was so pressed to the wall 
by people who probably were unaware of the intentions with 
which he had come that in spite of all his 
he had to give in and stop while carriages passed 
in beneath the beside petya stood a woman a footman 
two and a after standing some time in the petya 
tried to move forward in front of the others without 
waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began 
his way with his elbows but the woman just in 
front of him who was the first against whom he 
his angrily shouted at him   are you for 
young don you see we all standing still then why 
  can said the footman and also began his 
elbows to such effect that he pushed petya into a 
very corner of the  petya his face with his 
hands and pulled up the collar which he had arranged 
so well at home to seem like a man  
he felt that he no longer looked and feared that 
if he were now to the gentlemen in that he 
would not be to the emperor but it was impossible 
to up or move to another place because of the 
crowd one of the who drove past was an acquaintance 
of the rostovs and petya thought of asking his help 
but came to the that that would not be a 
thing to do when the carriages had all passed in 
the crowd carrying petya with it forward into the square 
which was already full of people there were people not 
only in the square but everywhere the and on the 
as soon as petya found himself in the square he 
clearly heard the sound of and the joyous voices of 
the crowd that filled the whole  for a while 
the crowd was less but suddenly all heads were and 
everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being pressed 
so that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted  
petya stood on and pushed and but could see nothing 
except the people about him  all the faces bore 
the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm a wife standing 
beside petya sobbed and the tears ran down her  
 dear one she kept repeating wiping away her tears 
with her fingers   was heard on all sides 
 for a moment the crowd stood still but then 
it made another rush forward  quite beside himself petya 
his teeth and rolling his eyes pushed forward his way 
and shouting  as if he were prepared that instant 
to kill himself and everyone else but on both sides 
of him other people with faces pushed forward and everybody 
shouted    this is what the emperor is 
thought petya  i can him myself would be too 
bold but in spite of this he continued to desperately 
forward and from between the of those in front he 
caught of an open space with a of red spread 
out on it but just then the crowd swayed back 
police in front were pushing back those who had pressed 
too close to the the emperor was passing from the 
to the of the petya unexpectedly received such a blow 
on his side and and was so hard that suddenly 
everything grew before his eyes and he lost consciousness when 
he came to himself a man of appearance with a 
of gray hair at the back of his head and 
wearing a blue a clerk and holding him under the 
arm with one hand while off the pressure of the 
crowd with the other   the young said the 
clerk  are you up to gently they him him 
 the emperor entered the of the the crowd spread 
out again more and the clerk led petya and the 
several people were sorry for petya and suddenly a crowd 
turned toward him and pressed round him those who stood 
him attended to him his coat seated him on the 
raised of the and those others  they might be 
who had him   might easily get killed that 
way what do they mean by it people poor dear 
he as white as a voices were heard saying  
petya soon came to himself the color returned to his 
face the had passed and at the cost of that 
he had obtained a place by the from where he 
to see the emperor who would be returning that way 
petya no longer thought of presenting his if he could 
only see the emperor he would be happy  while 
the service was in the of the was a service 
of on the occasion of the emperor arrival and of 
for the of peace with the crowd outside spread out 
and appeared and sweets  which petya was particularly fond 
and ordinary conversation could again be heard a wife was 
showing a in her shawl and telling how much the 
shawl had cost another was saying that all silk had 
now got dear the clerk who had petya was talking 
to a about the who were that day with the 
the clerk several times used the word   the 
service a word petya did not understand two young were 
with some girls who were all these conversations especially the 
with the girls were such as might have had a 
particular for petya at his age but they did not 
interest him now he sat on his of the agitated 
as before by the thought of the emperor and by 
his love for him the feeling of and fear he 
had experienced when he was being together with that of 
still further his sense of the importance of the occasion 
 suddenly the sound of a of was heard from 
the to the of peace with the and the crowd 
rushed impetuously toward the to watch the petya too would 
have run there but the clerk who had taken the 
young under his stopped him the was still when officers 
and gentlemen came running out of the and after them 
others in a more leisurely manner were again raised and 
those who had run to look at the ran back 
again at last four men in and from the doors 
 shouted the crowd again   is he which 
asked petya in a tearful voice of those around him 
but no one answered him everybody was too and petya 
on one of those four men whom he could not 
clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his 
eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm on him it happened not 
to be the emperor shouted  and that tomorrow come 
what might he would join the army  the crowd 
ran after the emperor followed him to the and began 
to it was already late and petya had not anything 
and was with yet he did not go home but 
stood with that but still considerable crowd before the while 
the emperor in at the expecting he knew not what 
and alike the he saw at the entrance to dine 
with the emperor and the court footmen who served at 
table of whom could be seen through the  while 
the emperor was dining looking out of the window said 
  people are still to see your majesty again 
 the dinner was nearly over and the emperor a 
rose and went out onto the the people with petya 
among them rushed toward the   dear one father 
cried the crowd and petya with it and again the 
women and men of petya among them wept with joy 
 a piece of the the emperor was holding in 
his hand broke off fell on the and then to 
the ground a in a who stood forward and it 
up several people in the crowd rushed at the seeing 
this the emperor had a of brought him and began 
them down from the petya eyes grew and still more 
by the danger of being he rushed at the he 
did not know why but he had to have a 
from the hand and he felt that he must not 
give way he forward and upset an old woman who 
was at a the old woman did not consider herself 
though she was lying on the ground at some but 
her hand did not reach them petya pushed her hand 
away with his knee seized a and as if fearing 
to be too late again shouted  with a voice 
already  the emperor went in and after that the 
greater part of the crowd began to   i 
said if only we waited so it was was being 
joyfully said by people  happy as petya was he 
felt sad at having to go home knowing that all 
the enjoyment of that day was over he did not 
go straight home from the but called on his friend 
who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment on 
returning home petya announced and firmly that if he was 
not allowed to enter the service he would run away 
and next day count ilya rostov he had not yet 
quite to how he could arrange for petya to serve 
where there would be least danger     
 chapter   two days later on the of 
july an immense number of carriages were standing outside the 
 the great were full in the first were the 
and in their in the second in full of blue 
and wearing in the hall there was an movement and 
of voices the chief sat on high chairs at a 
large table under the portrait of the emperor but most 
of the were about the room  all these whom 
pierre met every day at the club or in their 
own were in uniform in that of catherine day others 
in that of emperor others again in the new of 
alexander time or the ordinary uniform of the and the 
general of being in uniform something strange and to these 
and familiar both old and young the old men bald 
sallow and or and wrinkled were especially striking for the 
most part they sat quietly in their places and were 
silent or if they walked about and talked attached themselves 
to someone younger on all these faces as on the 
faces of the crowd petya had seen in the square 
there was a striking the general of a solemn and 
at the same time the interests in a boston card 
party peter the cook dmitrievna health and so on  
pierre was there too buttoned up since early morning in 
a uniform that had become too for him he was 
agitated this extraordinary gathering not only of but also of 
the  in him a whole of ideas he had 
long laid aside but which were deeply in his soul 
thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution the 
words that had struck him in the emperor appeal the 
sovereign was coming to the capital for with his people 
this idea and that in this direction something important which 
he had long was drawing near he about watching and 
listening to conversations but nowhere finding any of the ideas 
that occupied him  the emperor manifesto was read enthusiasm 
and then all moved about discussing it besides the ordinary 
topics of conversation pierre heard questions of where the of 
the were to stand when the emperor entered when a 
ball should be given in the emperor honor whether they 
should group themselves by or by whole and so on 
but as soon as the war was touched on or 
what the had been for the talk became and then 
all listening to speaking  a middle man handsome and 
in the uniform of a naval officer was speaking in 
one of the rooms and a small crowd was pressing 
round him pierre went up to the circle that had 
formed round the speaker and listened count ilya rostov in 
a military uniform of catherine time was with a pleasant 
smile among the crowd with all of whom he was 
acquainted he too approached that group and listened with a 
kindly smile and of approval as he always did to 
what the speaker was saying the naval man was speaking 
very boldly as was evident from the expression on the 
faces of the and from the fact that some people 
pierre knew as the and of men walked away or 
expressed with him pierre pushed his way into the middle 
of the group listened and convinced himself that the man 
was indeed a but of views quite different from his 
own the naval officer spoke in a particularly musical and 
voice swallowing his r and generally his the voice of 
a man calling out to his  me my pipe 
it was of dissipation and the exercise of   
if the people have to for the ah we to 
take as our if the noble of the of moscow 
thinks fit it can show its to our the in 
other have we the of the in the  all 
that did was to the sons and and  count 
ilya rostov smiled and nodded approval   was our 
of any use to the not at all it only 
our have another o men will soldiers no and we 
get only them the don lives one of us will 
go and in more and the  was the way 
he to the emperor  only say the word and 
we all die him added the orator with animation  
count rostov mouth with pleasure and he pierre but pierre 
wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling but not 
yet sure what him or what he would say scarcely 
had he opened his mouth when one of the a 
man without a in his head with a though angry 
expression standing near the first speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed 
to and to an he began in low but distinct 
tones   imagine sir said he with his mouth 
 we have been here not to discuss whether it 
best for the empire at the present moment to or 
to call out the we have been to reply to 
the appeal with which our sovereign the emperor has us 
but to judge what is best or the can leave 
to the  pierre suddenly saw an for his excitement 
he his heart against the who was this set and 
attitude into the of the pierre stepped forward and interrupted 
him he himself did not yet know what he would 
say but he began to speak eagerly occasionally into french 
or expressing himself in russian   me your excellency 
he began  was well acquainted with the but thought 
it necessary on this occasion to him  i don 
agree with the  he wished to say  tres 
honorable very honorable  the whom i have not the 
honor of knowing i suppose that the have been not 
merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to 
consider the means by which we can assist our i 
imagine he went on to his subject  the emperor 
himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely 
of serfs whom we are to to his service and 
chair a  we are ready to make of ourselves 
not to obtain from us any     
    for   many persons from 
the circle noticing the sarcastic smile and the freedom of 
pierre remarks only count rostov was pleased with them as 
he had been pleased with those of the naval officer 
the and in general with speech he had last heard 
  think that before discussing these questions pierre continued 
 should ask the emperor respectfully ask his majesty let 
us know the number of our and the position in 
which our army and our forces now are and then 
 but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he 
was attacked from three sides the most vigorous attack came 
from an old acquaintance a boston who had always been 
well disposed toward him was in uniform and whether as 
a result of the uniform or from some other cause 
pierre saw before him quite a different man with a 
expression of on his aged face shouted at pierre  
 the first place i tell you we have no 
right to question the emperor about that and if the 
russian had that right the emperor could not answer such 
a question the are moved to the movements and the 
number of men and  another voice that of a 
of medium height and about forty years of age whom 
pierre had met at the and knew as a bad 
and who also by his uniform came up to pierre 
interrupted   and this is not a time for 
discussing he continued  for there is war in russia 
the is to russia to the of our fathers to 
carry off our and children the his breast  will 
all every one of us will go for our father 
the he shouted rolling his eyes several voices were heard 
in the crowd  are russians and will not our 
blood in defense of our faith the throne and the 
we must if we are sons of our we will 
show europe how russia to the defense of russia  
pierre wished to reply but could not get in a 
word he felt that his words apart from what meaning 
they were less audible than the sound of his voice 
 count rostov at the back of the crowd was 
expressing approval several persons briskly turning a shoulder to the 
orator at the end of a phrase said   
right quite right just so  pierre wished to say 
that he was ready to sacrifice his money his serfs 
or himself only one ought to know the state of 
affairs in order to be able to it but he 
was unable to speak many voices shouted and talked at 
the same time so that count rostov had not time 
to signify his approval of them all and the group 
dispersed and then moved with a of talk into the 
hall and to the big table not only was pierre 
to speak but he was interrupted pushed aside and people 
turned away from him as from a common this happened 
not because they were by the of his speech which 
had even been forgotten after the many but to it 
the crowd a object to love and a object to 
hate pierre became the latter many other spoke after the 
and all in the same tone many spoke and with 
 the of the russian who was recognized  of 
 were heard in the crowd said that  must 
be by and that he had seen a child smiling 
at and but  will not be that child  
 yes at was repeated approvingly in the back rows 
of the crowd  the crowd drew up to the 
large table at which sat gray or bald and almost 
all of whom pierre had seen in their own with 
their or playing boston at the with an of voices 
the crowd to the table pressed by the against the 
high of the chairs the spoke one after another and 
sometimes two together those standing behind noticed what a speaker 
to say and hastened to supply it others in that 
heat and crush their to find some thought and hastened 
to utter it the old whom pierre knew sat and 
turned to look first at one and then at another 
and their faces for the most part only expressed the 
fact that they found it very hot pierre however felt 
and the general desire to show that they were ready 
to go to all found expression in the tones and 
looks more than in the of the him too he 
did not his opinions but felt himself in some way 
to and wished to justify himself   only said 
that it would be more to the purpose to make 
when we know what is said he trying to be 
heard above the other voices  one of the old 
men to him looked round but his attention was immediately 
by an at the other side of the table  
 moscow will be she will be our shouted one 
man   is the of mankind cried another  
me to speak  you are me    
  chapter   at that moment count with 
his and eyes wearing the uniform of a general with 
over his shoulder entered the room briskly to the front 
of the crowd of   sovereign the emperor will 
be here in a moment said  am straight from 
the seeing the position we are in i think there 
is little need for the emperor has deigned to summon 
us and the millions will from there pointed to the 
hall our business is to supply men and not spare 
ourselves that is the least we can do  a 
took place to the sitting at the table the whole 
passed more than quietly after all the noise the sound 
of their old voices saying one after another  agree 
or for  too am of that opinion and so 
on had even a mournful effect  the secretary was 
told to write down the resolution of the moscow and 
that they would ten men fully out of every thousand 
serfs as the had done their chairs made a scraping 
noise as the gentlemen who had rose with apparent relief 
and began up and down arm in arm to their 
legs and converse in couples   emperor the emperor 
a cry through the and the whole hurried to the 
entrance  the emperor entered the hall through a broad 
path between two lines of every face expressed curiosity pierre 
stood rather far off and could not hear all that 
the emperor said from what he did hear he understood 
that the emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire 
and of the he placed on the moscow he was 
answered by a voice which him of the resolution just 
arrived at   said the emperor with a quivering 
voice  there was a rustling among the crowd and 
it again so that pierre distinctly heard the human voice 
of the emperor saying with   never the devotion 
of the russian but today it has my expectations i 
thank you in the name of the gentlemen let us 
act time is most precious  the emperor ceased speaking 
the crowd began pressing round him and rapturous were heard 
from all sides   most precious a word said 
count rostov with a sob he stood at the back 
and though he had heard hardly anything understood everything in 
his own way  from the hall of the the 
emperor went to that of the there he remained about 
ten minutes pierre was among those who saw him come 
out from the hall with tears of in his eyes 
as became known later he had scarcely to the before 
tears from his eyes and he concluded in a voice 
when pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied 
by two one of whom pierre knew a fat the 
other was the a man with a thin sallow face 
and both were weeping tears filled the thin man eyes 
and the fat sobbed outright like a child and kept 
repeating   lives and property them your majesty  
pierre one feeling at the moment was a desire to 
show that he was ready to go all and was 
prepared to sacrifice everything he now felt ashamed of his 
speech with its and an opportunity of it having heard 
that count was a regiment bezukhov at once that he 
would give a thousand men and their maintenance  old 
rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed 
without tears and at once to petya request and went 
himself to enter his name  next day the emperor 
left moscow the assembled all took off their and settled 
down again in their and and not without some gave 
orders to their about the feeling themselves at what they 
had done      book ten  
     chapter i   napoleon 
began the war with russia because he could not going 
to could not help having his head turned by the 
he received could not help a uniform and to the 
stimulating influence of a morning and could not refrain from 
of anger in the presence of and then of  
alexander refused because he felt himself to be personally de 
tried to command the army in the best way because 
he wished to fulfill his duty and as a great 
commander rostov the french because he could not restrain his 
wish for a across a field and in the same 
way the people who took part in the war acted 
in accord with their circumstances and they were moved by 
fear or vanity or were that they knew what they 
were doing and did it of their own free will 
but they all were involuntary of history carrying on a 
work from them but to us such is the fate 
of men of and the higher they stand in the 
social hierarchy the less are they free  the of 
 have long since left the their interests have vanished 
leaving no trace and nothing remains of that time but 
its  compelled all these men to to further the 
of a result no one of them at all expected 
napoleon nor alexander nor still less any of those who 
did the  the cause of the of the french 
army in  is clear to us now no one 
will that that cause was on the one hand its 
into the heart of russia late in the without any 
for a winter and on the other the character given 
to the war by the burning of russian and the 
hatred of the foe this among the russian people but 
no one at the time foresaw  now seems so 
evident that this was the only way an army of 
eight hundred thousand men best in the world and led 
by the best general be destroyed in with a army 
of half its strength and led by as the russian 
army was not only did no one see this but 
on the russian side every effort was made to the 
only thing that could save russia while on the french 
side despite napoleon experience and so military every effort was 
to pushing on to moscow at the end of the 
summer that is to doing the very thing that was 
to lead to  in on the year  french 
are very fond of saying that napoleon felt the danger 
of his line that he a battle and that his 
him to stop at and of making to show that 
the danger of the was even then understood russian are 
still of telling us that from the of the a 
war plan was adopted to napoleon into the of russia 
and this plan some of them to others to a 
certain frenchman others to and others again to alexander himself 
to notes and which contain of such a line of 
but all these at what happened both from the french 
side and the russian are only because they fit in 
with the had that not occurred these would have been 
forgotten as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of 
and expectations to the contrary which were current then but 
have now been forgotten because the them there are always 
so many as to the of any that however it 
may end there will always be people to say  
said then that it would be so quite forgetting that 
amid their many were to quite the contrary effect  
as to napoleon of the danger of his line and 
 the russian side as to the into the of 
russia are evidently of that kind and only by much 
can such to napoleon and his or such to the 
russian all the are in flat to such during the 
whole period of the war not only was there no 
wish on the russian side to draw the french into 
the heart of the country but from their first into 
russia everything was done to stop them and not only 
was napoleon not afraid to his line but he every 
step forward as a and did not battle as eagerly 
as in former but very  at the very beginning 
of the war our were divided and our sole aim 
was to them though the was no if we meant 
to retire and the into the of the country our 
emperor joined the army to it to defend every of 
russian soil and not to the enormous was formed on 
plan and there was no intention of farther the emperor 
the in chief for every step they he could not 
bear the idea of letting the even reach still less 
could he the burning of moscow and when our did 
he was that was and without a general having been 
fought under its  so thought the emperor and the 
russian and people were still more at the thought that 
our forces were into the of the country  napoleon 
having cut our apart far into the country and several 
of an in august he was at and thought only 
of how to farther though as we now see that 
was evidently to him  the clearly show that napoleon 
did not the danger of the on moscow nor did 
alexander and the russian then think of napoleon on but 
quite the contrary the of napoleon into the of the 
country was not the result of any plan for no 
one believed it to be possible it from a most 
of intrigues and wishes among those who took part in 
the war and had no perception of the or of 
the one way of russia everything came about the were 
divided at the of the we tried to them with 
the evident intention of giving battle and the and by 
this effort to them while battle with a much and 
the at an angle led the french on to but 
we at an angle not only because the french between 
our two the angle became still more and we still 
farther because de was an by  would come under 
his command and in command of the second army to 
joining up and coming under command as long as he 
could was in the that was the chief aim of 
all at as he he exposed his army to danger 
on this march and it was best for him to 
retire more to the left and more to the south 
the from and and from the for his army and 
it looks as if he this in order not to 
come under the command of the whose rank was to 
his own  the emperor was with the army to 
it but his presence and of what steps to take 
and the enormous number of and destroyed the first army 
energy and it  the intention was to make a 
stand at the but aiming at becoming commander in chief 
unexpectedly employed his energy to influence alexander and whole plan 
was and the command to but as did not confidence 
his power was the were divided there was no of 
command and was but from this and the of the 
foreign commander in chief there on the one hand and 
the of a battle  we could not have refrained 
from had the been and had someone else instead of 
been in command and on the other an ever against 
the and an increase in  at last the emperor 
left the army and as the most and indeed the 
only pretext for his it was decided that it was 
necessary for him to the people in the and the 
nation in general to a war and by this visit 
of the emperor to moscow the strength of the russian 
army was  he left in order not to the 
commander in chief control of the army and that more 
would then be taken but the command of the became 
still more confused and the and a of adjutants general 
remained with the army to keep the commander in chief 
under observation and his energy and feeling less free than 
ever under the observation of all these  of the 
emperor became still more of any and giving battle  
stood for the at and demanded a general and the 
others of that group up so much trouble that under 
pretext of sending papers to the emperor these adjutants general 
to petersburg and into an open with and the  
at the at last much as it  drove up 
in a carriage to the house occupied by his and 
came out to meet and report to his senior officer 
 despite his in rank in this of magnanimity took 
his orders from but having agreed with him less than 
ever by the emperor orders direct to him he wrote 
to the emperor  must be as my sovereign but 
i cannot work with the  for god sake send 
me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment 
i cannot stand it here are so full of that 
a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in 
anything i thought i was really serving my sovereign and 
the but it out that i am serving i confess 
i do not want to  the of and and 
their like still further embittered the relations between the in 
chief and even less were made to fight the french 
before a general was sent to the position this general 
to visit a friend of his own a corps commander 
and having spent the day with him returned to and 
as from every point of the he had not seen 
 while and intrigues were going on about the future 
field of battle and while we were looking for the 
french lost touch with them french upon and reached the 
of  it was necessary to fight an battle at 
to save our lines of the battle was fought and 
thousands were killed on both sides  was contrary to 
the wishes of the emperor and of the whole people 
but was by its own had been by their and 
these setting an example to other russians went to moscow 
thinking only of their own but hatred of the foe 
napoleon farther and we thus at the very result which 
his      chapter ii   
the day after his son had left prince nicholas sent 
for princess mary to come to his study   
are you satisfied now said he  made me with 
my son satisfied are you that all you wanted satisfied 
it me it i old and weak and this is 
what you wanted well then over it over it  
after that princess mary did not see her father for 
a whole week he was ill and did not leave 
his study  princess mary noticed to her surprise that 
during this illness the old prince not only her from 
his room but did not admit mademoiselle either alone attended 
him  at the end of the week the prince 
and resumed his former way of life himself with special 
to building and the of the and completely breaking off 
his relations with mademoiselle his looks and cold tone to 
his daughter seemed to say  you see you against 
me you to prince andrew about my relations with that 
and made me with him but you see i need 
neither her nor you  princess mary spent half of 
every day with little nicholas watching his lessons him russian 
and music herself and talking to the rest of the 
day she spent over her with her old nurse or 
with  who sometimes came by the back door to 
see her  of the war princess mary thought as 
women do think about wars she feared for her brother 
who was in it was by and at the strange 
that men to kill one another but she did not 
understand the of this war which seemed to her like 
all previous wars she did not the of this war 
though with whom she constantly was passionately interested in its 
progress and tried to explain his own of it to 
her and though the  who came to see her 
in their own way the current among the people of 
an by antichrist and though julie  princess drubetskaya who 
had resumed with her wrote from moscow   write 
you in russian my good friend wrote julie in her 
russian  i have a for all the french and 
the same for their language which i cannot support to 
hear spoken we in moscow are by enthusiasm for our 
adored emperor   poor husband is and in but 
the news which i have me yet more   
heard probably of the of embracing his two sons and 
saying  will with them but we will not be 
and truly though the was twice than we we were 
we pass the time as we can but in war 
as in war the princesses and sit whole days with 
me and we unhappy of live men make beautiful conversations 
over our  only you my friend are missing and 
so on  the chief reason princess mary did not 
the full of this war was that the old prince 
never spoke of it did not recognize it and laughed 
at when he mentioned it at dinner the prince tone 
was so calm and confident that princess mary believed him 
 all that july the old prince was exceedingly active 
and even animated he another garden and began a new 
building for the serfs the only thing that made princess 
mary anxious about him was that he very little and 
instead of in his study as usual changed his place 
every day one day he would order his bed to 
be set up in the glass gallery another day he 
remained on the or on the chair in the drawing 
room and there without while of mademoiselle boy read to 
him then again he would spend a night in the 
dining room  on august  a second letter was 
received from prince andrew in his first letter which came 
soon after he had left home prince andrew had asked 
his father forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to 
say and begged to be restored to his favor to 
this letter the old prince had replied affectionately and from 
that time had kept the at a distance prince andrew 
second letter written near after the french had occupied that 
town gave a account of the whole for them a 
plan he had drawn and as to the further progress 
of the war in this letter prince andrew pointed out 
to his father the danger of staying at bald hills 
so near the of war and on the army direct 
line of march and him to move to moscow  
at dinner that day on that the french were said 
to have already entered the old prince remembered his son 
letter   was a letter from prince andrew today 
he said to princess mary you read it   
father she replied in a frightened voice  she could 
not have read the letter as she did not even 
know it had arrived   writes about this war 
said the prince with the smile that had become habitual 
to him in speaking of the present war   
must be very interesting said  andrew is in a 
position to know   very interesting said mademoiselle  
 and get it for me said the old prince 
to mademoiselle  know the on the little table  
mademoiselle jumped up eagerly   don he exclaimed with 
a frown  go michael  michael rose and went 
to the study but as soon as he had left 
the room the old prince looking uneasily round threw down 
his napkin and went himself   can do anything 
always make some he muttered  while he was away 
princess mary mademoiselle and even little nicholas exchanged looks in 
silence the old prince returned with quick steps accompanied by 
michael bringing the letter and a plan these he put 
down beside him letting anyone read them at dinner  
on moving to the drawing room he the letter to 
princess mary and spreading out before him the plan of 
the new building and his eyes upon it told her 
to read the letter aloud when she had done so 
princess mary looked inquiringly at her father he was the 
plan evidently in his own ideas   do you 
think of it prince to ask   i said 
the prince as if and not taking his eyes from 
the plan of the building   possibly the of 
war will move so near to us that   
the of war said the prince  have said and 
still say that the of war is and the will 
never get the  looked in amazement at the prince 
who was talking of the when the was already at 
the but princess mary forgetting the position of the thought 
that what her father was saying was correct   
the snow they in the only they could to see 
it the prince continued evidently thinking of the of  
which seemed to him so  should have into prussia 
sooner then things would have taken a different turn  
 prince began timidly  letter   the letter 
yes replied the prince  yes his face suddenly took 
on a expression he paused  he writes that the 
french were at at what river is it  dropped 
his eyes   prince says nothing about that he 
remarked gently   he but i didn it myself 
 no one spoke for a long time   
yes well michael he suddenly went on raising his head 
and pointing to the plan of the building  me 
how you mean to it  michael went up to 
the plan and the prince after speaking to him about 
the building looked angrily at princess mary and and went 
to his own room  princess mary saw and astonished 
look fixed on her father noticed his silence and was 
struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his 
son letter on the drawing table but she was not 
only afraid to speak of it and ask the reason 
of his and silence but was afraid even to think 
about it  in the evening michael sent by the 
prince came to princess mary for prince andrew letter which 
had been forgotten in the drawing room she gave it 
to him and unpleasant as it was to her to 
do so to ask him what her father was doing 
  busy replied michael with a respectfully smile which 
princess mary to turn pale  very much about the 
new building he has been reading a little but now 
went on lowering his voice he at his busy with 
his will i expect  of the prince favorite of 
late had been the of some papers he meant to 
leave at his death and which he called his  
  is being sent to asked princess mary  
 yes he has been waiting to start for some 
time      chapter iii   
when michael returned to the study with the letter the 
old prince with spectacles on and a over his eyes 
was sitting at his open with candles holding a paper 
in his hand and in a attitude was reading his 
 as he it was to be to the emperor 
after his death  when michael went in there were 
tears in the prince eyes evoked by the memory of 
the time when the paper he was now reading had 
been written he took the letter from michael hand put 
it in his up his papers and called in who 
had long been waiting  the prince had a list 
of things to be in and up and down the 
room past who stood by the door he gave his 
  you hear eight like this it must be 
exactly like the as in michael list  he up 
and down for a while and glanced at his notes 
  hand to the in person a letter about 
the deed  next for the doors of the new 
building were wanted and had to be of a special 
shape the prince had himself and a case had to 
be ordered to keep the  in  the to 
took over two hours and still the prince did not 
let him go he sat down into thought closed his 
eyes and off made a slight movement   go 
go if anything more is wanted i send after you 
 went out the prince again went to his glanced 
into it his papers closed the again and sat down 
at the table to write to the  it was 
already late when he rose after the letter he wished 
to sleep but he knew he would not be able 
to and that most thoughts came to him in bed 
so he called and went through the rooms with him 
to show him where to set up the bed for 
that night  he went about looking at every corner 
every place seemed but of all was his in the 
study that was dreadful to him probably because of the 
thoughts he had had when lying there it was everywhere 
but the corner behind the in the sitting room was 
better than other places he had never there yet  
with the help of a footman brought in the and 
began putting it up   not right that not 
right cried the prince and himself pushed it a few 
inches from the corner and then closer in again  
 at last i finished now i rest thought the 
prince and let him  frowning with vexation at the 
effort necessary to himself of his coat and the prince 
sat down heavily on the bed and appeared to be 
as he looked contemptuously at his legs he was not 
but only the moment of making the effort to lift 
those legs up and turn over on the bed  
how hard it is oh that this might end and 
you would release me thought he pressing his lips together 
he made that effort for the twenty time and lay 
down but hardly had he done so before he felt 
the bed and beneath him as if it were breathing 
heavily and this happened to him almost every night he 
opened his eyes as they were   peace them 
he muttered angry he knew not with whom  yes 
there was something else important very important that i was 
keeping till i should be in bed the no i 
told him about them no it was something something in 
the drawing room princess mary talked some nonsense that fool 
said something something in my remember   what did 
we talk about at dinner   prince michael  
 quiet quiet the prince his hand on the table 
 i know prince andrew letter princess mary read it 
said something about now i read it  he had 
the letter taken from his and the table which stood 
a glass of and a close to the bed and 
putting on his spectacles he began reading only now in 
the of the night reading it by the faint light 
under the green did he its meaning for a moment 
  french at in four days march they may 
be at perhaps are already there jumped up  no 
i don want anything he shouted  he put the 
letter under the and closed his eyes and there rose 
before him the at bright the russian and himself a 
young general without a on his face vigorous and entering 
gaily and a burning sense of jealousy of  favorite 
agitated him now as strongly as it had done then

short stout woman the empress mother with her smile and 
her words at her first gracious reception of him and 
then that same face on the and the he had

his own business he soon forgot it  all the 
interests of his life for more than thirty years had 
been by the will of the prince and he never 
went that everything not connected with the execution of the 
prince orders did not interest and did not even exist 
for  on reaching on the evening of the fourth

     chapter v   from 
the continued to followed by the on the tenth of 
august the regiment prince andrew was along the past the 
leading to bald hills heat and had continued for more 
than three each day across the sky and occasionally veiled 
the sun but toward evening the sky again and the 
sun set in heavy night alone the earth the was 
and its the up the cattle from finding no food 
on the sun only at night and in the while 
the was there any but on the road the along 
which the there was no such even at night or 
when the road passed through the forest the was on 
the dust up more than six inches deep as soon 
as day the march began the and moved through the 
deep dust that rose to the very of the wheels 
and the infantry in that soft hot dust that never 
even at night some of this dust was by the 
feet and wheels while the rest rose and like a 
cloud over the settling in eyes ears hair and and 
of all in the of the men and as they 
moved along that road the higher the sun rose the 
higher rose that cloud of dust and through the of 
its hot fine one could look with eye at the 
sun which showed like a huge crimson ball in the 
sky there was no wind and the men in that 
they with tied over their and when they passed through 
a village they all rushed to the and fought for 
the water and drank it down to the  prince 
andrew was in command of a regiment and the of 
that regiment the welfare of the men and the necessity 
of receiving and giving orders him the burning of and 
its made an in his life a feeling of anger 
against the foe made him forget his own sorrow he 
was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and 
was and kind to his men and officers in the 
regiment they called him  prince were proud of him 
and loved him but he was kind and gentle only 
to those of his regiment to and the like quite 
new to him belonging to a different world and who 
could not know and understand his past as soon as 
he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the 
staff he up immediately and grew spiteful ironical and everything 
that reminded him of his past was to him and 
so in his relations with that former circle he himself 
to trying to do his duty and not to be 
 in truth everything itself in a dark and gloomy 
light to prince andrew especially after the of on the 
of august  considered that it could and should have 
been and after his father had had to to moscow 
to his bald hills which he had built and but 
despite this to his regiment prince andrew had something to 
think about entirely apart from general questions two days he 
had received news that his father son and sister had 
left for moscow and though there was nothing for him 
to do at bald hills prince andrew with a desire 
to his own decided that he must ride there  
he ordered his horse to be and leaving his regiment 
on the march to his father where he had been 
born and spent his childhood past the where there used 
always to be of women as they their linen or 
beat it with prince andrew noticed that there was not 
a soul about and that the little from its place 
and half was on its side in the middle of 
the he to the no one at the stone entrance 
of the drive and the door stood open grass had 
already to grow on the garden and horses and were 
in the english park prince andrew up to the some 
of the glass were broken and of the in tubs 
some were and others up he called for taras the 
but no one replied having gone round the corner of 
the to the garden he saw that the garden was 
broken and branches of the had been off with the 
fruit an old whom prince andrew in his childhood had 
often seen at the was sitting on a green garden 
seat a  he was and did not hear prince 
andrew ride up he was sitting on the seat the 
old prince used to like to sit on and beside 
him of were hanging on the broken and of a 
 prince andrew up to the house several in the 
old garden had been cut down and a and her

all closed except at one window which was open a 
little boy seeing prince andrew ran into the house having 
sent his family away was alone at bald hills and 
was sitting reading the lives of the on hearing that 
prince andrew had come he went out with his spectacles 
on his nose his coat and hastily up without a 
word began weeping and kissing prince andrew knee  then 
vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began 
to report on the position of affairs everything precious and 
had been removed to of had also been away the 
and the spring of which said there had been a 
that year had been by the and down while still 
green the were some of them too had gone to 
only a few remained  without waiting to hear him

sister leave meaning when did they leave for moscow  
understanding the question to to their for replied that they 
had left on the and again went into the asking 
for   i to let the have the and 
to take a for them we have still six hundred 
left he inquired   am i to say to 
him thought prince andrew looking down on the old man 
bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the 
expression on his face that the old man himself understood 
how such questions were and only asked them to his 
  let them have it replied prince andrew  
 you noticed some in the garden said  was 
impossible to prevent it three have been here and spent 
the night i took down the name and rank of 
their officer to hand in a about it   
and what are you going to do will you stay 
here if the the place asked prince andrew  turned 
his face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenly 
with a solemn gesture raised his arm   is 
my his will be done he exclaimed  a group 
of was approaching across the toward the prince   
good said prince andrew bending over to  must go 
away too take away what you can and tell the 
serfs to go to the or to the one near 
moscow  clung to prince andrew and burst into gently 
himself the prince his horse and down the at a 
 the old man was still sitting in the garden 
like a fly on the face of a loved one 
who is dead the last on which he was making 
the and two little girls running out from the hot 
house carrying in their they had from the there came 
upon prince andrew on seeing the young the elder one 
with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand 
and hid with her behind a tree not stopping to 
pick up some green they had dropped  prince andrew 
turned away with startled to let them see that they 
had been observed he was sorry for the pretty frightened 
little girl was afraid of looking at her and yet 
felt an desire to do so a new of and 
relief came over him when seeing these girls he realized 
the of other human interests entirely from his own and 
just as as those that occupied him evidently these girls 
passionately desired one thing carry away and eat those green 
without being caught prince andrew their wish for the success 
of their he could not looking at them once more 
their danger past they from their ambush and something in 
their little voices and holding up their their bare little 
feet merrily and quickly across the grass  prince andrew 
was by having off the along which the were moving 
but not far from bald hills he again came out 
on the road and overtook his regiment at its place 
by the of a small it was past one o 
the sun a red ball through the dust and his 
back through his black coat the dust always above the 
of talk that came from the resting there was no 
wind as he the prince andrew the and of the 
he to get into that water however dirty it might 
be and he glanced round at the from came sounds 
of and laughter the small green had more than a 
foot the because it was full of the white of 
soldiers with hands and faces who were about in it 
all this white human laughing and about in that dirty 
like into a can and the of in that it 
specially pathetic  one fair young of the third company 
whom prince andrew knew and who had a round the 
of one himself stepped back to get a good run 
and into the water another a dark officer who was 
always stood up to his in the water joyfully his 
muscular figure and with satisfaction as he the water over 
his head with hands to the there were sounds of 
men slapping one another and  everywhere on the bank 
on the and in the there was white muscular the 
officer with his red little nose standing on the wiping 
himself with a felt confused at seeing the prince but 
made up his mind to him nevertheless   very 
nice your excellency you like to said he   
dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace   clear 
it out for you in a minute said and still 
ran off to clear the men out of the  
 prince wants to   prince ours said many 
voices and the men were in such to clear out 
that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that 
he would rather wash himself with water in the  
 he thought and he looked at his own body 
and not from cold but from a sense of and 
horror he did not himself understand by the sight of 
that immense number of about in the dirty   
on the of august prince wrote as follows from his 
at mikhaylovna on the road   dear count was 
to but knew that his letter would be read by 
the emperor and therefore every word in it to the 
best of his ability  i expect the  de 
has already the of to the it is and sad 
and the whole army is in despair that this most 
important place has been i for my part begged him 
personally most and finally wrote him but nothing would him 
to consent i to you on my honor that napoleon 
was in such a as never before and might have 
lost half his army but could not have taken our 
fought and are as never before with fifteen thousand men 
i held the at for thirty hours and beat him 
but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours 
it is a on our army and as for him 
he ought it seems to me not to live if 
he reports that our were great it is not true 
perhaps about four thousand not more and not even that 
but even were they ten thousand that war but the 
has lost  what would it have cost him to 
hold out for another two days they would have had 
to retire of their own accord for they had no 
water for men or horses he gave me his word 
he would not but suddenly sent that he was that 
night we cannot fight in this way or we may 
soon bring the to moscow  there is a that 
you are thinking of peace god forbid that you should 
make peace after all our and such you would set 
all russia against you and every one of us would 
feel ashamed to wear the uniform if it has come 
to this must fight as long as russia can and 
as long as there are men able to stand  
one man ought to be in command and not two 
your may perhaps be good as a but as a 
general he is not merely bad but yet to him 
is the fate of our whole country i am really 
with vexation forgive my boldly it is clear that the 
man who the of a peace and that the should 
command the army does not love our sovereign and desires 
the of us all so i write you call out 
the for the is leading these visitors after him to 
moscow in a most way the whole army great of 
the imperial aide he is said to be more napoleon 
man than ours and he is always the i am 
not merely civil to him but obey him like a 
though i am his senior this is painful but my 
benefactor and sovereign i only i am sorry for the 
emperor that he our fine army to such as he 
consider that on our we have lost by and left 
in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men and had 
we attacked this would not have happened tell me for 
god sake what will russia our mother russia say to 
our being so frightened and why are we our good 
and to such and of hatred and shame in all 
our what are we scared at and of whom are 
we afraid i am not to that the is a 
and has all bad qualities the whole army it and 
calls down upon him      chapter 
vi   among the to the of human life 
one may between those in which and those in which 
form to the latter distinguished from village country or even 
moscow life may petersburg life and especially the life of 
its that life of the is unchanging since the year 
 we had made peace and had again with bonaparte 
and had made and them again but the of anna 
pavlovna and helene remained just as they had been one 
seven and the other five years before at anna pavlovna 
they talked with of bonaparte just as before and saw 
in them and in the shown to him by the 
sovereigns a the sole object of which was to cause 
and anxiety to the court circle of which anna pavlovna 
was the and in helene which rumyantsev himself with his 
visits regarding helene as a remarkably intelligent woman they talked 
with the same in  as in  of the 
 nation and the  man and our with france 
a which to them ought to be by peace  
of late since the emperor return from the army there 
had been some excitement in these and some of to 
one another but each retained its own in anna pavlovna 
circle only those were who were deep and views were 
expressed to the effect that one ought not to go 
to the french and that to maintain the french was 
costing the government as much as a whole army corps 
the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only 
the reports most to our army were in the french 
circle of helene and rumyantsev the reports of the of 
the and of the war were and all napoleon at 
were discussed in that circle they those who hurried for 
a to of the court and the girls under the 
of the dowager empress in helene circle the war in 
general was regarded as a of which would very soon 
end in peace and the expressed by now in petersburg 
was quite at home in helene house which every clever 
man was to visit not by but by those who 
it would matters be settled in that circle the moscow 
enthusiasm of which had reached petersburg with the emperor return 
and very though with much  anna pavlovna circle on 
the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of 
it as of the of the prince vasili who still 
occupied his former important formed a between these two he 
his  friend anna pavlovna as well as his daughter 
 and often in his constant and between the two 
became confused and said at helene what he should have 
said at anna pavlovna and  soon after the emperor 
return prince vasili in a conversation about the war at 
anna pavlovna severely de but was as to who ought 
to be appointed commander in chief one of the visitors 
usually spoken of as  man of great having described 
how he had that day seen kutuzov the newly chief 
of the petersburg over the of at the to that 
kutuzov would be the man to all  anna pavlovna 
remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had done nothing 
but cause the emperor annoyance   have talked and 
talked at the of the prince vasili interrupted  they 
did not listen to me i told them his as 
chief of the would not please the emperor they did 
not listen to me   all this mania for 
he went on  who for it is all because 
we want to the foolish enthusiasm of those prince vasili 
continued forgetting for a moment that though at helene one 
had to the moscow enthusiasm at anna pavlovna one had 
to be ecstatic about it but he his mistake at 
once  is it that count kutuzov the oldest general 
in russia should at that he will get nothing for 
his how could they make a man commander in chief 
who cannot a horse who at a and has the 
very a good reputation he made for himself at i 
don speak of his capacity as a general but at 
a time like this how they a old man a 
fine idea to have a general he can see anything 
to play he can see at all  no one 
replied to his remarks  this was quite correct on 
the twenty of july but on the twenty of july 
kutuzov received the of prince this might indicate a wish 
to get rid of him and therefore prince vasili opinion 
continued to be correct though he was not now in 
any to express it but on the of august a 
of field and met to consider the progress of the 
war this came to the that our were to a 
want of in the command and though the members of 
the were aware of the emperor of kutuzov after a 
short they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in 
chief that same day kutuzov was appointed commander in chief 
with full over the and over the whole region occupied 
by them  on the of august prince vasili at 
anna pavlovna again met the  of great the latter 
was very attentive to anna pavlovna because he wanted to 
be appointed of one of the for young ladies prince 
vasili entered the room with the air of a happy 
who has the object of his desires   have 
you heard the great news prince kutuzov is field all 
are at an end i am so glad so delighted 
at last we have a man said he glancing sternly 
and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room  
the  of great despite his desire to obtain the 
post of could not refrain from prince vasili of his 
former opinion though this was to prince vasili in anna 
pavlovna drawing room and also to anna pavlovna herself who 
had received the news with he could not the  
 prince they say he is said he prince vasili 
of his own words   nonsense he well enough 
said prince vasili rapidly in a deep voice and with 
a slight cough voice and cough with which he was 
to of all difficulties   well enough he added 
 what i am so pleased about he went on 
 that our sovereign has given him full over all 
the and the whole region no commander in chief ever 
had before he is a second he concluded with a 
victorious smile   grant it god grant it said 
anna pavlovna  the  of great who was still 
a in court wishing to anna pavlovna by her former 
position on this question observed   is said that 
the emperor was to give kutuzov those they say he 
blushed like a girl to whom is read when he 
said to kutuzov  emperor and the you this honor 
  the heart took no part in that speech 
said anna pavlovna   no no warmly rejoined prince 
vasili who would not now kutuzov to anyone in his 
opinion kutuzov was not only himself but was adored by 
everybody  that impossible said he  our sovereign appreciated 
him so highly before   grant only that prince 
kutuzov real power and does not allow anyone to put 
a spoke in his observed anna pavlovna  understanding at 
once to whom she alluded prince vasili said in a 
whisper   know for a fact that kutuzov made 
it an absolute condition that the should not be with 
the army do you know what he said to the 
emperor  and prince vasili repeated the words to have 
been spoken by kutuzov to the emperor  can neither 
him if he does wrong nor reward him if he 
does right   a very man is prince kutuzov 
i have known him a long time   even 
say remarked the  of great who did not yet 
tact  his excellency made it an express condition that 
the sovereign himself should not be with the army  
as soon as he said this both prince vasili and 
anna pavlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at 
one another with a sigh at his naivete   
   chapter vii   while this was 
taking place in petersburg the french had already passed and 
were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow napoleon like other 
of his trying to justify his hero says that he 
was drawn to the of moscow against his will he 
is as right as other who look for the of 
in the will of one man he is as right 
as the russian who maintain that napoleon was drawn to 
moscow by the of the russian here besides the law 
of which all the past as a for that subsequently 
occur the law of comes in the whole matter a 
good having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his 
from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake 
in the opening but that at each of the game 
there were and that none of his were he only 
notices the mistake to which he attention because his took 
of it how much more than this is the game 
of war which under certain of time and where it 
is not one will that lifeless but everything from of 
 after napoleon a battle at and then at but 
it happened that to a of circumstances the russians could 
not give battle till they reached from moscow from napoleon 
ordered a direct on moscow  la de grand empire 
la des d de  this moscow gave napoleon no 
rest on the march from to he his light accompanied 
by his guards his his and his chief of staff 
dropped behind to question a russian captured by the cavalry 
followed by d an he overtook napoleon at a and 
in his horse with an amused expression    
      the capital of this 
great empire the      city of 
alexander people moscow with its      
like    asked napoleon   of says 
that corps is joining up with the main army and 
that kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief he is 
a very and fellow  napoleon smiled and told them 
to give the cossack a horse and bring the man 
to him he wished to talk to him himself several 
adjutants off and an hour later the had over to 
rostov up to napoleon in an jacket and on a 
french cavalry with a merry and tipsy face napoleon told 
him to ride by his side and began him  
 are a cossack   a cossack your honor 
  cossack not knowing in what company he was 
for napoleon plain appearance had nothing about it that would 
to an oriental mind the presence of a monarch talked 
with extreme familiarity of the of the war says narrating 
this in having got drunk the day before and left 
his had been and sent to the village in of 
where he engaged in till the french took him was 
one of those coarse bare who have seen all sorts 
of things consider it necessary to do everything in a 
mean and way are ready to any sort of service 
to their and are at their especially those by vanity 
and  finding himself in the company of napoleon whose 
he had easily and recognized was not in the least 
but merely did his to gain his new favor  
he knew very well that this was napoleon but napoleon 
presence could no more him than rostov or a major 
with the would have done for he had nothing that 
either the major or napoleon could deprive him of  
so he rattled on telling all the gossip he had 
heard among the much of it true but when napoleon 
asked him whether the russians thought they would beat bonaparte 
or not screwed up his eyes and considered  in 
this question he saw subtle as men of his type 
see in everything so he frowned and did not answer 
immediately   like this he said  there a 
battle soon yours will that right but if three days 
pass then after that well then that same battle will 
not soon be over  d smilingly this speech to 
napoleon thus  a battle takes place within the next 
three days the french will but if later god knows 
what will happen napoleon did not smile though he was 
evidently in high good and he ordered these words to 
be repeated  noticed this and to entertain him further 
not to know who napoleon was added   know 
that you have bonaparte and that he has everybody in 
the world but we are a different matter knowing why 
or how this bit of slipped out at the end 
 the these words without the last phrase and bonaparte 
smiled  young cossack made his smile says after a 
few in silence napoleon turned to and said he wished 
to see how the news that he was talking to 
the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written 
his victorious name on the would this don   
       of the don 
  the fact was to  understanding that this 
was done to him and that napoleon expected him to 
be frightened to his new pretended to be astonished and 
opened his eyes wide and assumed the expression he usually 
put on when taken to be  soon as napoleon 
had spoken says  cossack seized by amazement did not 
utter another word but on his eyes fixed on the 
whose had reached him across the of the east all 
his was suddenly and replaced by a naive and silent 
feeling of napoleon after making the cossack a present had 
him set free like a restored to its  napoleon 
on of the moscow that so to his and  
restored to its to our on the way all that 
had not taken place but that he meant to to 
his comrades what had really taken place he did not 
wish to because it seemed to him not worth telling 
he found the inquired for the regiment with and by 
evening found his nicholas rostov at rostov was just to 
go for a ride round the with he let have 
another horse and took him along with him   
   chapter viii   princess mary was 
not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew 
 after the return of from the old prince suddenly 
seemed to as from a he ordered the to be 
called up from the and and wrote a letter to 
the commander in chief him that he had to remain 
at bald hills to the last and to defend it 
leaving to the commander in chief to take or not 
for the defense of bald hills where one of russia 
oldest would be captured or killed and he announced to 
his household that he would remain at bald hills  
but while himself remaining he gave for the of the 
princess and with the little prince to and to moscow 
princess mary alarmed by her father and after his previous 
could not bring herself to leave him alone and for 
the first time in her life to him she refused 
to go away and her father broke over her in 
a terrible he repeated every he had ever on her 
trying to convict her he told her she had worn 
him out had his with his son had of him 
making it the object of her life to his and 
he drove her from his study telling her that if 
she did not go away it was all the same 
to him he declared that he did not wish to 
remember her and her not to to let him see 
her the fact that he did not as she had 
feared order her to be carried away by force but 
only told her not to let him see her princess 
mary she knew it was a that in the of 
his soul he was glad she was remaining at home 
and had not gone away  the morning after little 
nicholas had left the old prince his full uniform and 
prepared to visit the commander in chief his was already 
at the door princess mary saw him walk out of 
the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and 
go down the garden to his and serfs she sat 
by the window listening to his voice which reached her 
from the garden suddenly several men came running up the 
with frightened faces  princess mary ran out to the 
porch down the flower path and into the a large 
crowd of and were moving toward her and in their 
midst several men were by the and along a little 
old man in a uniform and she ran up to 
him and in the play of the that fell in 
small round through the of the could not be sure 
what change there was in his face all she could 
see was that his former stern and determined expression had 
altered to one of and on seeing his daughter he 
moved his lips and made a sound it was impossible 
to make out what he wanted he was lifted up 
carried to his study and laid on the very he 
had so feared of late  the doctor who was 
that same night him and said that the prince had 
had a his right side  it was becoming more 
and more dangerous to remain at bald hills and next 
day they moved the prince to the doctor him  
by the time they reached and the little prince had 
already left for moscow  for three the old prince 
lay by in the new house prince andrew had built 
at ever in the same state getting neither better nor 
worse he was and lay like a distorted corpse he 
muttered his eyebrows and lips and it was impossible to 
tell whether he understood what was going on around him 
or not one thing was certain he was suffering and 
wished to say something but what it was no one 
could tell it might be some of a and half 
man or it might to public affairs or possibly to 
family  the doctor said this did not mean anything 
and was to causes but princess mary thought he wished 
to tell her something and the fact that her presence 
always his her opinion  he was evidently suffering both 
physically and mentally there was no hope of it was 
impossible for him to travel it would not do to 
let him die on the road  it not be 
better if the end did come the very end princess 
mary sometimes thought night and day hardly at all she 
watched him and terrible to say often watched him not 
with hope of finding signs of but wishing to find 
of the of the end  strange as it was 
to her to this feeling in herself yet there it 
was and what seemed still more terrible to her was 
that since her father illness began  even sooner when 
she stayed with him expecting something to happen all the 
desires and that had been forgotten or within her had 
thoughts that had not entered her mind for years of 
a life free from the fear of her father and 
even the of love and of family happiness continually in 
her like of the devil thrust them aside as she 
would questions continually to her as to how she would 
order her life now after that these were of the 
devil and princess mary knew it she knew that the 
sole against him was and she tried to she assumed 
an attitude of looked at the repeated the words of 
a but she could not she felt that a different 
world had now taken of her life of a world 
of and free quite to the world in which till 
now she had been and in which her greatest had 
been she could not could not and cares took of 
her  it was becoming dangerous to remain in news 
of the of the french came from all sides and 
in one village ten from a had been by french 
 the doctor on the necessity of moving the prince 
the of the sent an official to princess mary to 
her to get away as quickly as possible and the 
head of the police having come to the same thing 
saying that the french were only some twenty away that 
french were in the and that if the princess did 
not take her father away before the he could not 
answer for the  the princess decided to leave on 
the the cares of and giving orders for which everyone 
came to her occupied her all day she spent the 
night of the as usual without in the room next 
to the one where the prince lay several times waking 
up she heard his and muttering the creak of his 
bed and the steps of and the doctor when they 
turned him over several times she listened at the door 
and it seemed to her that his were louder than 
usual and that they turned him over she could not 
sleep and several times went to the door and listened 
wishing to enter but not deciding to do so though 
he did not speak princess mary saw and knew how 
unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to 
him she had noticed with what he turned from the 
look she sometimes fixed on him she knew that her 
going in during the night at an hour would him 
 but never had she felt so for him or 
so much afraid of losing him she recalled all her 
life with him and in every word and act of 
his found an expression of his love of her occasionally 
amid these of the devil would into her thoughts of 
how things would be after his death and how her 
new life would be ordered but she drove these thoughts 
away with toward morning he became quiet and she fell 
 she late that which often comes with waking showed 
her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father illness 
on waking she listened to what was going on behind 
the door and hearing him said to herself with a 
sigh that things were still the same   what 
could have happened what did i want i want his 
death she cried with a feeling of for herself  
she washed dressed said her and went out to the 
porch in front of it stood carriages without horses and 
things were being into the  it was a warm 
gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch still by 
her and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to 
her father the doctor came downstairs and went out to 
her   is a little better today said he 
 was looking for you one can make out something 
of what he is saying his head is come in 
he is asking for you  princess mary heart beat 
so at this news that she grew pale and leaned 
against the wall to keep from falling to see him 
talk to him feel his eyes on her now that 
her whole soul was with those dreadful wicked was a 
of joy and   said the doctor  princess 
mary entered her father room and went up to his 
bed he was lying on his back up high and 
his small bony hands with their were lying on the 
his left eye gazed straight before him his right eye 
was and his brows and lips he seemed so thin 
small and pathetic his face seemed to have or his 
features had grown princess mary went up and kissed his 
hand his left hand pressed hers so that she understood 
that he had long been waiting for her to come 
he her hand and his brows and lips quivered angrily 
 she looked at him in dismay trying to guess 
what he wanted of her when she changed her position 
so that his left eye could see her face he 
down not taking his eyes off her for some then 
his lips and tongue moved sounds came and he began 
to speak gazing timidly and imploringly at her evidently afraid 
that she might not understand  all her princess mary 
looked at him the with which he moved his tongue 
made her drop her eyes and with difficulty the that 
rose to her he said something repeating the same words 
several times she could not understand them but tried to 
guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words 
he uttered   he repeated several times  it 
was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor thought 
he had guessed them and inquiringly repeated  are you 
afraid the prince shook his head again repeated the same 
sounds   mind my mind aches princess mary  
he made a sound in of this took her hand 
and began pressing it to different of his breast as 
if trying to find the right place for it  
 thoughts about you thoughts he then uttered much more 
clearly than he had done before now that he was 
sure of being understood  princess mary pressed her head 
against his hand trying to hide her and tears  
he moved his hand over her hair   have 
been calling you all night he brought out   
only i had known she said through her tears  
was afraid to come in  he pressed her hand 
  you   i did not sleep said 
princess mary shaking her head  her father she now 
tried to express herself as he did as much as 
possible by signs and her tongue too seemed to move 
with difficulty   one princess mary could not quite 
make out what he had said but from his look 
it was clear that he had uttered a tender word 
such as he had never used to her before  
didn you come in   i was wishing for 
his death thought princess mary  he was silent  
 you daughter dear for all for all forgive thank 
you forgive thank you and tears began to flow from 
his eyes  andrew he said suddenly and a childish 
timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as 
he spoke  he himself seemed aware that his demand 
was meaningless so at least it seemed to princess mary 
  have a letter from him she replied  
he glanced at her with timid surprise   is 
he   with the army father at  he 
closed his eyes and remained silent a long time then 
as if in answer to his and to the fact 
that now he understood and remembered everything he nodded his 
head and his eyes   he said softly and 
distinctly  has perished they destroyed her  and he 
began to sob and again tears from his eyes princess 
mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she 
gazed at his face  again he closed his eyes 
his ceased he pointed to his eyes and understanding him 
away the tears  then he again opened his eyes 
and said something none of them could understand for a 
long time till at last understood and repeated it princess 
mary had the meaning of his words in the mood 
in which he had just been speaking she thought he 
was speaking of russia or prince andrew of herself of 
his or of his own death and so she could 
not guess his words   on your white dress 
i like it was what he said  having understood 
this princess mary sobbed still louder and the doctor taking 
her arm led her out to the her and trying 
to her to prepare for her when she had left 
the room the prince again began speaking about his son 
about the war and about the emperor angrily his brows 
and raising his voice and then he had a second 
and final  princess mary stayed on the the day 
had it was hot and she could understand nothing think 
of nothing and feel nothing except passionate love for her 
father love such as she thought she had never felt 
till that moment she ran out sobbing into the garden 
and as far as the along the of young prince 
andrew had   i i i wished for his 
death yes i wanted it to end i wished to 
be at peace and what will become of me what 
use will peace be when he is no longer here 
princess mary murmured pacing the garden with hurried steps and 
pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with  
when she had the of the garden which brought her 
again to the house she saw mademoiselle had remained at 
and did not wish to leave it toward her with 
a stranger this was the of the of the who 
had come personally to point out to the princess the 
necessity for her princess mary listened without understanding him she 
led him to the house offered him and sat down 
with him then herself she went to the door of 
the old prince room the doctor came out with an 
agitated face and said she could not enter   
away princess go away go away  she returned to 
the garden and sat down on the grass at the 
foot of the by the where no one could see 
her she did not know how long she had been 
there when she was by the sound of a woman 
footsteps running along the path she rose and saw her 
maid who was evidently looking for her and who stopped 
suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her   
come princess the prince said in a breaking voice  
 i coming i coming replied the princess hurriedly not 
giving time to finish what she was saying and trying 
to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house 
  it god will you must be prepared for 
everything said the meeting her at the house door  
 me alone it not true she cried angrily to 
him  the doctor tried to stop her she pushed 
him aside and ran to her father door  are 
these people with frightened faces stopping me i don want 
any of them and what are they doing here she 
thought she opened the door and the bright in that 
room startled her in the room were her nurse and 
other women they all drew back from the bed making 
way for her he was still lying on the bed 
as before but the stern expression of his quiet face 
made princess mary stop short on the   he 
not dead impossible she told herself and approached him and 
the that seized her she pressed her lips to his 
but she stepped back immediately all the force of the 
tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and 
was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay 
there before her  he is no more he is 
not but here where he was is something and some 
dreadful and and hiding her face in her hands princess 
mary into the arms of the doctor who held her 
up   in the presence of and the doctor 
the women washed what had been the prince tied his 
head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not 
while open and with another handkerchief tied together the legs 
that were already spreading apart then they dressed him in 
uniform with his and placed his little body on a 
table heaven only knows who arranged all this and when 
but it all got done as if of its own 
accord toward night candles were burning round his a was 
spread over it the floor was with of a band 
was tucked in under his head and in a corner 
of the room sat a reading the  just as 
horses shy and and about a dead horse so the 
of the house and crowded into the drawing room round 
the the village elder women all with fixed and frightened 
eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the old prince cold 
and hand      chapter ix  
 until prince andrew settled in its had always been 
and its were of quite a different character from those 
of bald hills they differed from them in speech dress 
and disposition they were called the old prince used to 
of them for their at work when they came to 
bald hills to help with the or to and but 
he them for their  prince andrew last stay at 
when he introduced and and the the had to pay 
had not their disposition but had on the contrary in 
them the of character the old prince called were always 
current among them at one time a that they would 
all be as at another of a new to which 
they were all to be then of some of the 
and of an to the in   connection with 
which it was that freedom had been them but the 
had stopped it then of peter return to the throne 
in seven years time when everything would be made free 
and so  that there would be no of the 
war with bonaparte and his were connected in their minds 
with the same sort of of antichrist the end of 
the world and  freedom  in the of were 
large belonging to the or to whose serfs paid and 
could work where they pleased there were very few in 
the neighborhood and also very few or serfs and in 
the lives of the of those the in the life 
of the russian people the causes and meaning of which 
are so to were more clearly and strongly than among 
others one which had occurred some twenty years before was 
a movement among the to to some  of among 
them the suddenly began their cattle and moving in whole 
families toward the as birds to somewhere the sea so 
these men with their and children to the to where 
none of them had ever been they set off in 
their freedom one by one or ran away and drove 
or walked toward the  many of them were some 
sent to many died of cold and on the road 
many returned of their own accord and the movement died 
down of itself just as it had sprung up without 
apparent reason but such still among the people and gathered 
new forces ready to themselves just as unexpectedly and at 
the same time simply naturally and now in  to 
anyone living in close touch with these people it was 
apparent that these were strongly and an  who had 
reached before the old prince death noticed an agitation among 
the and that contrary to what was in the bald 
hills where over a of forty all the were moving 
away and leaving their to be by the the in 
the region round were it was in touch with the 
french received from them that passed from hand to hand 
and did not he learned from serfs to him that 
the who possessed great influence in the village and had 
recently been away a government had returned with news that 
the were deserted but that the french did not them 
also knew that on the previous day another had even 
brought from the village of which was occupied by the 
french a by a french general that no would be 
done to the and if they remained they would be 
paid for anything taken from them as of this the 
had brought from a hundred rubles in notes  did 
not know that they were paid to him in for 
 more important still learned that on the morning of 
the very day he gave the village elder orders to 
to move the princess from there had been a village 
meeting at which it had been decided not to move 
but to wait yet there was no time to on 
the the day of the old prince death the had 
on princess mary leaving at once as it was becoming 
dangerous he had told her that after the he could 
not be for what might happen on the evening of 
the day the old prince died the went away promising 
to return next day for the but this he was 
unable to do for he received that the french had 
unexpectedly and had time to his own family and from 
his  for some thirty years had been managed by 
the village elder whom the old prince called by the 
  was one of those physically and mentally vigorous 
who grow big as soon as they are of age 
and go on till they are or without a gray 
hair or the of a as straight and strong at 
as at thirty  soon after the to the  
in which he had taken part like the rest was 
made village elder and of and had since filled that 
post irreproachably for twenty years the feared him more than 
they did their the both the old prince and the 
young and the respected him and called him  during 
the whole time of his service had never been drunk 
or ill never after or the had he shown the 
least and though he could not read he had never 
forgotten a single money account or the number of of 
in any of the he for the prince nor a 
single of the whole on any single of the  
from the bald hills sent for his on the day 
of the prince and told him to have twelve horses 
got ready for the princess carriages and for the things 
to be removed from though the paid thought no difficulty 
would be made about with this order for there were 
two hundred and thirty households at work in and the 
were well to do but on hearing the order lowered 
his eyes and remained silent named certain he knew from 
whom he told him to take the  replied that 
the horses of these were away named others but they 
too to had no horses some horses were for the 
government others were too weak and others had died for 
want of it seemed that no horses could be had 
even for the carriages much less for the  looked 
at and frowned just as was a model village elder 
so had not managed the prince estates for twenty years 
in vain he was a model in the highest degree 
the of the and of those he with having glanced 
at he at once understood that his did not express 
his views but the general mood of the by which 
the elder had already been carried away but he also 
knew that who had property and was by the must 
be between the two the and the serfs he noticed 
this in look and therefore frowned and moved closer up 
to him   just listen said he  talk 
nonsense to me his excellency prince andrew himself gave me 
orders to move all the people away and not leave 
them with the and there is an order from the 
about it too anyone who is a traitor to the 
do you hear   hear answered without lifting his 
eyes  was not satisfied with this reply   
it will turn out badly he said shaking his head 
  power is in your hands rejoined sadly  
 drop it repeated his hand from his bosom and 
solemnly pointing to the floor at feet  can see 
through you and three into the ground under you he 
continued gazing at the floor in front of  was 
disconcerted glanced at and again lowered his eyes   
drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready 
to leave their and go to moscow and to get 
ready for tomorrow morning for the princess things and don 
go to any meeting yourself do you hear  suddenly 
fell on his knees   me take the from 
me and me for sake   that cried sternly 
 see through you and three under you he repeated 
knowing that his in his knowledge of the right time 
to the and the fact that he had been able 
to the old prince favor for twenty years had long 
since gained him the reputation of being a and that 
the power of seeing three under a man is considered 
an of  got up and was about to say 
something but interrupted him   is it you have 
got into your heads eh what are you thinking of 
eh   am i to do with the people 
said  quite beside themselves i have already told them 
  them i say said  they drinking he 
asked   beside themselves they another   then 
listen i go to the police officer and you tell 
them so and that they must stop this and the 
must be got ready   understand  did not 
further he had managed people for a long time and 
knew that the chief way to make them obey is 
to show no that they can possibly having a  
understand from himself with that though he not only but 
felt almost certain that without the help of the would 
not be  and so it was for when evening 
came no had been in the village outside the drink 
another meeting was being held which decided that the horses 
should be driven out into the and the should not 
be without saying anything of this to the princess had 
his own taken out of the which had arrived from 
bald hills and had those horses got ready for the 
princess carriages meanwhile he went himself to the police  
    chapter x   after her 
father princess mary herself up in her room and did 
not admit anyone a maid came to the door to 
say that was asking for orders about their  was 
before his talk with princess mary raised herself on the 
sofa on which she had been lying and replied through 
the closed door that she did not mean to go 
away and begged to be left in peace  the 
of the room in which she was lying looked she 
lay on the sofa with her face to the wall 
the buttons of the and seeing nothing but that and 
her confused thoughts were on one subject of death and 
her own which she had not suspected but which had 
shown itself during her father illness she wished to but 
did not to dared not in her present state of 
mind herself to god she lay for a long time 
in that position  the sun had reached the other 
side of the house and its shone into the open 
window up the room and part of the at which 
princess mary was looking the flow of her thoughts suddenly 
stopped she sat up smoothed her hair got up and 
went to the window inhaling the of the clear but 
evening   you can well enjoy the evening now 
he is gone and no one will you she said 
to herself and into a chair she let her head 
fall on the window sill  someone spoke her name 
in a soft and tender voice from the garden and 
kissed her head she looked up it was mademoiselle in 
a black dress and she softly approached princess mary kissed 
her and immediately began to cry the princess looked up 
at her all their former and her own jealousy to 
her mind but she remembered too how he had changed 
of late toward mademoiselle and could not bear to see 
her showing how were the princess mary had mentally addressed 
to her  is it for me for me who 
desired his death to anyone she thought  princess mary 
to herself the position of mademoiselle whom she had of 
late kept at a distance but who yet was on 
her and living in her house she felt sorry for 
her and held out her hand with a glance of 
gentle inquiry mademoiselle at once began crying again and kissed 
that hand speaking of the princess sorrow and making herself 
a partner in it she said her only was the 
fact that the princess allowed her to her sorrow that 
all the old misunderstandings should into nothing but this great 
that she felt herself in regard to everyone and that 
he from above saw her affection and gratitude the princess 
heard her not heeding her words but occasionally looking up 
at her and listening to the sound of her voice 
  position is terrible dear princess said mademoiselle after 
a pause  understand that you could not and cannot 
think of yourself but with my love for you i 
must do so has been to you has he spoken 
to you of going away she asked  princess mary 
did not answer she did not understand who was to 
go or where to  it possible to plan or 
think of anything now is it not all the same 
she thought and did not reply   know chere 
said mademoiselle  we are in danger by the french 
it would be dangerous to move now if we go 
we are almost sure to be taken prisoners and god 
knows  princess mary looked at her companion without understanding 
what she was talking about   if anyone knew 
how little anything matters to me now she said  
course i would on no account wish to go away 
from him did say something about going speak to him 
i can do nothing nothing and don want to  
 spoken to him he we should be in time 
to get away tomorrow but i think it would now 
be better to stay here said mademoiselle  you will 
agree chere to fall into the hands of the soldiers 
or of riotous would be terrible  mademoiselle took from 
her reticule a  on ordinary russian paper of general 
telling people not to leave their and that the french 
would them proper she this to the princess   
think it would be best to appeal to that general 
she continued  i am sure that all respect would 
be shown you  princess mary read the paper and 
her face began to with   whom did you 
get this she asked   probably recognized that i 
am french by my name replied mademoiselle blushing  princess 
mary with the paper in her hand rose from the 
window and with a pale face went out of the 
room and into what had been prince andrew study  
 send or or somebody to me she said  
tell mademoiselle not to come to me she added hearing 
mademoiselle voice  must go at once at once she 
said at the thought of being left in the hands 
of the french   prince andrew heard that i 
was in the power of the french that i the 
daughter of prince nicholas bolkonski asked general for and his 
favor this idea her made her shudder blush and feel 
such a rush of anger and pride as she had 
never experienced before all that was and especially all that 
was humiliating in her position rose to her mind  
the french would in this house le general would prince 
andrew study and himself by looking through and reading his 
and papers mademoiselle would do the of for him i 
should be given a small room as a favor the 
soldiers would my father newly grave to his and stars 
they would tell me of their over the russians and 
would to with my sorrow thought princess mary not thinking 
her own thoughts but feeling to think like her father 
and her brother for herself she did not care where 
she remained or what happened to her but she felt 
herself the of her dead father and of prince andrew 
she thought their thoughts and felt their what they would 
have said and what they would have done she felt 
to say and do she went into prince andrew study 
trying to enter completely into his ideas and considered her 
position  the of life which had seemed to her 
by her father death all at once rose before her 
with a new force and took of her  agitated 
and flushed she the room sending now for michael and 
now for or the nurse and the other maids could 
not say in how far mademoiselle statement was correct was 
not at home he had gone to the police neither 
could the michael who on being sent for came in 
with sleepy eyes tell princess mary anything with just the 
same smile of with which for fifteen years he had 
been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views 
of his own he now replied to princess mary so 
that nothing definite could be got from his the old 
with face that bore the of replied  princess to 
all princess mary questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as 
he looked at her  at length the village elder 
entered the room and with a deep bow to princess 
mary came to a halt by the  princess mary 
walked up and down the room and stopped in front 
of him   she said regarding as a sure 
friend this who always used to bring a special kind 
of from his visit to the fair at every year 
and smilingly it to her  now since our she 
began but could not go on   are all

were silent for a while   has gone off 
somewhere and i have no one to turn to is 
it true as they tell me that i can even 
go away   you go away your excellency you 
can go said   was told it would be 
dangerous because of the dear friend i can do nothing 
i understand nothing i have i want to go away 
tonight or early tomorrow morning  paused he looked askance 
at princess mary and said  are no horses i 
told so   are there none asked the princess 
  all god said  horses we had have 
been taken for the army or have died is such 
a year it not a case of horses may die 
of ourselves as it is some go three days without

what he told her   are they have no 
she asked   dying of said  not a 
case of   why didn you tell me isn 
it possible to help them i do all i can 
 to princess mary it was strange that now at 
a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul there 
could be rich people and poor and the rich could 
refrain from helping the poor she had heard that there 
was such a thing as  which was sometimes given 
to the she also knew that neither her father nor 
her brother would refuse to help the in need she 
only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the 
of the she wished to give she was glad such 
cares themselves her without to forget her own she began 
asking about the and what there was in that belonged 
to the   we have belonging to my brother 
she said   is all safe replied  prince 
did not order it to be   it to 
the let them have all they need i give you 
leave in my brother name said she  made no 
answer but deeply   them that if there is 
enough of it it all i give this order in 
my brother name and tell them that what is ours 
is we do not them anything tell them so  
looked at the princess while she was speaking   
me little mother for god sake order the to be 
taken from me said he  have served twenty years 
and have done no wrong me for god sake  
princess mary did not understand what he wanted of her 
or why he was asking to be she replied that 
she had never his devotion and that she was ready 
to do anything for him and for the   
   chapter xi   an hour later 
came to tell the princess that had come and all 
the had assembled at the by the princess order and 
wished to have word with their   i never 
told them to come said princess mary  only told 
to let them have the   for god sake 
princess dear have them sent away and don go out 
to them it all a trick said  when returns 
let us get away and please don   is 
a trick asked princess mary in surprise   know 
it is only listen to me for god sake ask 
nurse too they say they don agree to leave as 
you ordered   making some mistake i never ordered 
them to go away said princess mary   came 
and words the had come by the princess order  
 i never sent for them declared the princess  
must have given my wrong i only said that you 
were to give them the  only in reply  
 you order it they will go away said he 
  no i go out to them said princess 
mary and in spite of the nurse and she went 
out into the porch the nurse and michael following her 
  probably think i am them the to them 
to remain here while i myself go away leaving them 
to the mercy of the french thought princess mary  
will them and at our moscow i am sure andrew 
would do even more in my place she thought as 
she went out in the toward the crowd standing on 
the by the  the men crowded closer together and 
rapidly took off their princess mary lowered her eyes and 
tripping over her came close up to them so many 
different eyes old and young were fixed on her and 
there were so many different faces that she could not 
distinguish any of them and feeling that she must speak 
to them all at once did not know how to 
do it but again the sense that she her father 
and her brother gave her courage and she boldly began 
her speech   am very glad you have come 
she said without raising her eyes and feeling her heart 
quickly and  tells me that the war has you 
that is our common and i shall nothing to help 
you i am myself going away because it is dangerous 
here the is near because i am giving you everything 
my friends and i beg you to take everything all 
our so that you may not suffer want and if 
you have been told that i am giving you the 
to keep you here is not true on the contrary 
i ask you to go with all your to our 
near moscow and i promise you i will see to 
it that there you shall want for nothing you shall 
be given food and  the princess stopped were the 
only sound heard in the crowd   am not 
doing this on my own account she continued  do 
it in the name of my dead father who was 
a good to you and of my brother and his 
son  again she paused no one broke the silence 
  is a common and we will it together 
all that is mine is yours she concluded the faces 
before her  all eyes were gazing at her with 
one and the same expression she could not whether it 
was curiosity devotion gratitude or and the expression on all 
the faces was   are all very for your 
but it won do for us to take the said 
a voice at the back of the crowd   
why not asked the princess  no one replied and 
princess mary looking round at the crowd found that every 
eye she met now was immediately dropped   why 
don you want to take it she asked again  
no one answered  the silence began to the princess 
and she tried to catch someone eye   don 
you speak she inquired of a very old man who 
stood just in front of her on his stick  
you think something more is wanted tell me i will 
do anything said she his eye  but as if 
this him he bent his head quite low and muttered 
  should we agree we don want the  
 should we give up everything we don agree don 
agree we are sorry for you but we not go 
away yourself alone came from sides of the crowd  
and again all the faces in that crowd bore an 
expression though now it was certainly not an expression of 
curiosity or gratitude but of angry   you can 
have understood me said princess mary with a sad smile 
 don you want to go i promise to house 
and you while here the would you  but her 
voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd  
 not let them us we won take your we 
don agree  again princess mary tried to catch someone 
eye but not a single eye in the crowd was 
turned to her evidently they were all trying to avoid 
her look she felt strange and awkward   yes 
an tale follow her into pull down your and go 
into i say  give you indeed she says voices 
in the crowd were heard saying  with drooping head 
princess mary left the crowd and went back to the 
house having repeated her order to to have horses ready 
for her next morning she went to her room and 
remained alone with her own thoughts     
 chapter xii   for a long time that 
night princess mary sat by the open window of her 
room hearing the sound of the voices that reached her 
from the village but it was not of them she 
was thinking she felt that she could not understand them 
however much she might think about them she thought only 
of one thing her sorrow which after the break by 
cares for the present seemed already to belong to the 
past now she could remember it and or  after 
sunset the wind had dropped the night was calm and 
fresh toward the voices began to a the full moon 
began to show from behind the a fresh white began 
to rise and over the village and the house  
of the near past father illness and last moments one 
after another to her memory with mournful pleasure she now 
lingered over these with horror only the last one the 
picture of his death which she felt she could not 
even in at this still and hour of night and 
these themselves to her so clearly and in such that 
they seemed now present now past and now future  
she recalled the moment when he had his first and 
was being along by his through the garden at bald 
hills muttering something with his tongue his gray eyebrows and 
looking uneasily and timidly at her   then he 
wanted to tell me what he told me the day 
he died she thought  had always thought what he 
said then and she recalled in all its the night 
at bald hills before he had the last when with 
a of she had remained at home against his will 
she had not and had downstairs on and going to 
the door of the conservatory where he that night had 
listened at the door in a suffering and weary voice 
he was saying something to speaking of the and its 
warm and of the empress evidently he had wanted to 
talk  why didn he call me why didn he 
let me be there instead of princess mary had thought 
and thought again now  he will never tell anyone 
what he had in his soul never will that moment 
return for him or for me when he might have 
said all he to say and not but i might 
have heard and understood him why didn i enter the 
room she thought  he would then have said to 
me what he said the day he died while talking 
to he asked about me twice he wanted to see 
me and i was standing close by outside the door 
it was sad and painful for him to talk to 
who did not understand him i remember how he began 
speaking to him about lise as if she were had 
forgotten she was dead reminded him that she was no 
more and he shouted  he was greatly depressed from 
behind the door i heard how he lay down on 
his bed and loudly exclaimed  god why didn i 
go in then what could he have done to me 
what could i have lost and perhaps he would then 
have been and would have said that word to me 
and princess mary uttered aloud the word he had said 
to her on the day of his death  she 
repeated and began sobbing with tears that relieved her soul 
she now saw his face before her and not the 
face she had known ever since she could remember and 
had always seen at a distance but the timid face 
she had seen for the first time quite with all 
its wrinkles and when she stooped near to his mouth 
to catch what he said   she repeated again 
  was he thinking when he uttered that word 
what is he thinking now this question suddenly itself to 
her and in answer she saw him before her with 
the expression that was on his face as he lay 
in his with his up with a white handkerchief and 
the horror that had seized her when she touched him 
and convinced herself that that was not he but something 
and horrible seized her again she tried to think of 
something else and to but could do neither with wide 
eyes she gazed at the and the expecting every moment 
to see his dead face and she felt that the 
silence over the house and within it held her fast 
  she whispered  she screamed and herself out 
of this silence she ran to the to meet her 
old nurse and the who came running toward her  
    chapter xiii   on the 
of august rostov and accompanied by who had just returned 
from and by an hussar left their at ten from

no idea that the village he was entering was the 
property of that very bolkonski who had been engaged to 
his sister  rostov and gave to their horses for 
a last race along the before reaching and rostov was

the new arrivals without their two tall old with wrinkled 
faces and scanty from the smiling and some song and 
approached the officers   fellows said rostov laughing  
there any here   how like one another said 
  me sang one of the with a smile 
 one of the men came out of the crowd 
and went up to rostov   do you belong 
to he asked   french replied  here is 
napoleon himself he pointed to   you are russians 
the asked again   is there a large force 
of you here said another a short man coming up 
  large answered rostov  why have you here 
he added  it a   old men have 
met to talk over the business of the replied the 
moving away  at that moment on the road leading 
from the big house two women and a man in 
a white hat were seen coming toward the officers  
 one in pink is mine so keep off said 
on seeing running toward him   be ours said 
to winking   do you want my pretty said 
with a smile   princess ordered me to ask 
your regiment and your name   is count rostov

a smile as he looked at talking to the girl 
following to rostov having his head while still at a 
distance   i make bold to trouble your honor 
said he respectfully but with a of for the of 
this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom 
 daughter of general in chief prince nicholas bolkonski who 
died on the of this month finding herself in difficulties 
to the of these people pointed to the you to 
come up to the house won you please ride on 
a little farther said with a melancholy smile  it 
is not in the presence of he pointed to the 
two who kept as close to him as to a 
horse   ah grand forgive us for sake eh 
said the smiling joyfully at him  rostov looked at 
the tipsy and smiled   perhaps they your honor 
remarked with a air as he pointed at the old 
men with his free hand   there not much 
to be amused at here said rostov and on a 
little way  the matter he asked   make 
bold to inform your honor that the here don wish 
to let the leave the and to her horses so 
that though everything has been up since morning her excellency 
cannot get away   exclaimed rostov   have 
the honor to report to you the truth said  
rostov gave his horse to the and followed to the 
house him as to the state of affairs it appeared 
that the princess of to the the previous day and 
her talk with and at the meeting had had so 
bad an effect that had finally given up the and 
joined the and had not appeared when sent for him 
and that in the morning when the princess gave orders 
to for her the had come in a large crowd 
to the and sent word that they would not let 
her leave the village that there was an order not 
to move and that they would the horses had gone 
out to them but was told  was chiefly who 
did the talking not showing himself in the crowd that 
they could not let the princess go that there was 
an order to the contrary but that if she stayed 
they would serve her as before and obey her in 
everything  at the moment when rostov and were along 
the road princess mary despite the of her nurse and 
the maids had given orders to and intended to start 
but when the were they were taken for the ran 
away and the women in the house began to wail 
  benefactor god has sent you exclaimed deeply moved 
voices as rostov passed through the anteroom  princess mary 
was sitting and in the large sitting room when rostov 
was shown in she could not who he was and 
why he had come or what was to her when 
she saw his russian face and by his walk and 
the first words he uttered recognized him as a man 
of her own class she glanced at him with her 
deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that 
faltered and trembled with this meeting immediately struck rostov as 
a  girl with left to the mercy of coarse 
and what a strange fate sent me here what and 
there are in her features and expression thought he as 
he looked at her and listened to her timid story 
 when she began to tell him that all this 
had happened the day after her father her trembled she 
turned away and then as if fearing he might take 
her words as meant to move him to pity looked 
at him with an glance of inquiry there were tears 
in rostov eyes princess mary noticed this and glanced gratefully 
at him with that radiant look which the plainness of 
her face to be forgotten   cannot express princess 
how glad i am that i happened to ride here 
and am able to show my to serve you said 
rostov rising  when you please and i give you 
my word of honor that no one shall to cause 
you annoyance if only you will allow me to act 
as your and respectfully as if to a lady of 
blood he moved toward the door  rostov deferential tone 
seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy 
to be acquainted with her he did not wish to 
take of her to upon her  princess mary understood 
this and appreciated his delicacy   am very very 
grateful to you she said in french  i hope 
it was all a and that no one is to 
for it she suddenly began to cry   me 
she said  rostov his brows left the room with 
another low bow      chapter xiv 
   is she pretty ah friend pink one 
is her name is  but on glancing at rostov 
face stopped short he saw that his hero and commander 
was following quite a different train of thought  rostov 
glanced angrily at and without strode off with steps to 
the village   show them i give it to 
them the brigands said he to himself  at a 
only just not to run kept up with him with 
difficulty   decision have you been pleased to come 
to said he  rostov stopped and his suddenly and 
sternly turned on   what decision old cried he 
 have you been about eh the are and you 
can manage them you a traitor yourself i know you 
i you all and as if afraid of his store 
of anger he left and went rapidly forward his offended 
kept with rostov at a and continued to his views 
he said the were and that at the present moment 
it would be to  them without an force and 
would it not be better first to send for the 
military   give them force i  them uttered 
rostov with animal and the need to it  without 
considering what he would do he moved with quick resolute 
steps toward the crowd and the nearer he drew to 
it the more felt that this might produce good the 
in the crowd were when they saw rostov firm steps 
and resolute frowning face  after the hussars had come 
to the village and rostov had gone to see the 
princess a certain and had among the crowd some of 
the said that these new arrivals were russians and might 
take it that the was being detained was of this 
opinion but as soon as he expressed it and others 
attacked their   many years have you been on 
the shouted at him  all one to you you 
up your of money and take it away with you 
what does it matter to you whether our are or 
not   been told to keep order and that 
no one is to leave their or take away a 
single and that all about it cried another   
was your son turn to be but no fear you 
your of a son a little old man suddenly began 
so they took my to be for a but we 
all have to die   be sure we all 
have to die i not against the said   
it against it you filled your  the two tall 
had their say as soon as rostov followed by and 
came up to the crowd his fingers into his and 
smiling a little walked to the front on the contrary 
to the and the crowd drew closer together   
is your elder here hey shouted rostov coming up to 
the crowd with quick steps   elder what do 
you want with him asked  but before the words 
were well out of his mouth his cap off and 
a blow his head to one side   off 
shouted rostov in a voice  the elder he cried 
  elder he wants the elder you and voices

a voice not his own by the collar  him

but and  however ran up to and seized him

began taking off their   the elder demanded rostov 
in a loud voice  with a pale and frowning 
face stepped out of the crowd   you the

not possibly meet with any  and in fact two 
more began who took off his own and it to 
them as if to them   you all listen

at once and don let one of your voices be

another   what did i say said coming into

the and the crowd began at once to through the 
village  the two men were led off to the 
house the two drunken followed them   when i 
look at you said one of them to   
can one talk to the like that what were you 
thinking of you fool added the other real fool  
two hours later the were standing in the courtyard of 
the house the were briskly carrying out the and them 
on the and at princess mary wish from the where 
he had been was standing in the yard the men 
  put it in so said one of the 
a man with a round smiling face taking a from 
a  know it has cost money how can you 
it in like that or it under the where it 
get rubbed i don like that way of doing things 
let it all be done properly to rule look here 
put it under the and it with the way  
 said another bringing out prince andrew library  catch 
up against it it heavy   they worked all 
day and didn play remarked the tall round gravely pointing 
with a significant at the that were on the top 
  to himself on the princess rostov did not 
go back to the house but remained in the village 
awaiting her when her carriage drove out of the house 
he and accompanied her eight from to where the road 
was occupied by our at the at he respectfully took 
leave of her for the first time himself to kiss 
her hand   can you speak so he replied 
to princess mary expressions of gratitude for her as she 
what had occurred  police officer would have done as 
much if we had had only to fight we should 
not have let the come so far said he with 
a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject 
 am only happy to have had the opportunity of 
making your acquaintance good princess i wish you happiness and 
and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances if 
you don want to make me blush please don thank 
me  but the princess if she did not again 
thank him in words thanked him with the whole expression 
of her face radiant with gratitude and tenderness she could 
not believe that there was nothing to thank him for 
on the contrary it seemed to her certain that had 
he not been there she would have perished at the 
hands of the and of the french and that he 
had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save 
her and even more certain was it that he was 
a man of lofty and noble soul able to understand 
her position and her sorrow his kind eyes with the 
tears rising in them when she herself had to cry 
as she spoke of her did not leave her memory 
 when she had taken leave of him and remained 
alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears and 
then not for the first time the strange question itself 
to her did she love him  on the rest 
of the way to moscow though the princess position was 
not a cheerful one who went with her in the 
carriage more than once noticed that her leaned out of 
the window and smiled at something with an expression of 
mingled joy and sorrow   i do love him 
thought princess mary  ashamed as she was of acknowledging 
to herself that she had in love with a man 
who would perhaps never love her she herself with the 
thought that no one would ever know it and that 
she would not be to if without ever speaking of 
it to anyone she continued to the end of her 
life to love the man with whom she had in 
love for the first and last time in her life 
 sometimes when she recalled his looks his sympathy and 
his words happiness did not appear impossible to her it 
was at those moments that noticed her smiling as she 
looked out of the carriage window   it not 
fate that brought him to and at that very moment 
thought princess mary  that his sister to refuse my 
brother and in all this princess mary saw the hand 
of  the the princess made on rostov was a 
very agreeable one to remember her gave him pleasure and 
when his comrades hearing of his at rallied him on 
having gone to look for and having picked up one 
of the in russia he grew angry it made him 
angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle princess 
mary who was attractive to him and had an enormous 
fortune had against his will more than once entered his 
head for himself personally nicholas could not wish for a 
better wife by marrying her he would make the countess 
his mother happy would be able to put his father 
affairs in order and would even felt it princess mary 
happiness  but sonya and his word that was why 
rostov grew angry when he was rallied about princess bolkonskaya 
     chapter xv   on 
receiving command of the kutuzov remembered prince andrew and sent 
an order for him to report at  prince andrew 
arrived at on the very day and at the very 
hour that kutuzov was the for the first time he 
stopped in the village at the house in front of 
which stood the commander in chief carriage and he sat 
down on the at the awaiting his serene as everyone 
now called kutuzov from the field the village came now 
sounds of music and now the of many voices shouting 
 to the new commander in chief two a courier 
and a major stood near by some ten from prince 
andrew availing themselves of kutuzov and of the fine weather 
a short lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick and up 
to the and glancing at prince andrew inquired whether his 
serene was putting up there and whether he would soon 
be back  prince andrew replied that he was not 
on his serene staff but was himself a new arrival 
the lieutenant colonel turned to a who with the peculiar 
with which a commander in chief to officers replied  
 his serene i expect he be here soon what 
do you want  the lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled 
beneath his mustache at the tone gave his horse to 
a dispatch and approached bolkonski with a slight bow bolkonski 
made room for him on the and the lieutenant colonel 
sat down beside him   also waiting for the 
commander in chief said he  say he thank god 
it awful with those had to ask to be to 
be a german now will get a look in as 
it was devil only knows what was we kept and 
did you take part in the he asked   
had the pleasure replied prince andrew  only of taking 
part in the but of losing in that all i 
held dear to mention the and home of my father 
who died of i belong to the of   
you bolkonski glad to make your acquaintance i lieutenant colonel 
better known as  said pressing prince andrew hand and 
looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention  
i heard said he sympathetically and after a short pause 
added  it it all well not for those who 
get it in the neck so you are bolkonski he 
swayed his head  pleased to make your acquaintance he 
repeated again smiling sadly and he again pressed prince andrew 
hand  prince andrew knew from what natasha had told 
him of her first this memory carried him sadly and 
sweetly back to those painful of which he had not 
thought lately but which still found place in his soul 
of late he had received so many new and very 
serious as the from his visit to bald hills and 
the news of his father death had experienced so many 
that for a long time past those had not entered 
his mind and now that they did they did not 
act on him with nearly their former strength for too 
the by the name of bolkonski belonged to a past 
when after supper and after natasha he had to a 
little girl of fifteen without what he was doing he 
smiled at the of that time and of his love 
for natasha and passed at once to what now interested 
him passionately and this was a plan of he had 
while serving at the during the he had that plan 
to de and now wished to it to kutuzov the 
plan was on the fact that the french line of 
was too and it that instead of or with on 
the front to the of the french we should attack 
their line of he began explaining his plan to prince 
andrew   can hold all that line it impossible 
i will to give me five men and i will 
the line that certain there only one way  rose 
and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to bolkonski 
in the midst of his shouts were heard from the 
army growing more and more mingling with music and and 
coming from the field where the was held sounds of 
and shouts were the village   coming he coming 
shouted a cossack standing at the  bolkonski and moved 
to the at which a of soldiers  of honor 
was standing and they saw kutuzov coming down the street 
on a rather small horse a huge of behind him 
was almost beside him and a crowd of officers ran 
after and around them shouting   his adjutants into 
the yard before him kutuzov was on his horse which 
smoothly under his weight and he raised his hand to 
his white horse cap with a red band and no 
nodding his head continually when he came up to the 
of honor a fine set of wearing who were giving 
him the he looked at them silently and attentively for 
nearly a minute with the steady of a commander and 
then turned to the crowd of and officers him suddenly 
his face assumed a subtle expression he shrugged his shoulders 
with an air of   with such fine fellows 
to and well good general he added and into the 
yard past prince andrew and   shouted those behind 
him  since prince andrew had last seen him kutuzov 
had grown still more and fat but the the and 
the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same 
he was wearing the white horse cap and a military 
with a hanging over his shoulder by a thin he 
sat heavily and swayed on his little horse   
he just as he into the yard his face expressed 
the relief of strain felt by a man who means 
to rest after a ceremony he drew his left foot 
out of the and with his whole body and puckering 
his face with the effort raised it with difficulty onto 
the leaned on his knee and slipped down into the 
arms of the and adjutants who stood ready to assist 
him  he pulled himself together looked round screwing up 
his eyes glanced at prince andrew and evidently not him 
moved with his waddling to the porch  he and 
again glanced at prince andrew as often with old men 
it was only after some that the produced by prince 
andrew face itself up with kutuzov remembrance of his  
 how do you do my dear prince how do 
you do my dear boy come along said he glancing 
round and he stepped onto the porch which under his 
weight  he his coat and sat down on a 
in the porch   how your father   
received news of his death yesterday replied prince andrew  
kutuzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay 
and then took off his cap and himself   
the of heaven be his god will be done to 
us all he deeply his whole chest and was silent 
for a while  loved him and respected him and 
with you with all my heart  he embraced prince 
andrew pressing him to his fat breast and for some 
time did not let him go when he him prince 
andrew saw that kutuzov lips were and that tears were 
in his eyes he and pressed on the with both 
hands to himself   come with me we have 
a talk said he  but at that moment no 
more intimidated by his than by the came with spurs 
up the steps of the porch despite the angry of 
the adjutants who tried to stop him kutuzov his hands 
still pressed on the seat glanced at him having given 
his name announced that he had to to his serene 
a matter of great importance for their country welfare kutuzov 
looked at him and lifting his hands with a gesture 
of annoyance them across his repeating the words  our 
country welfare well what is it speak blushed like a 
girl  was strange to see the color rise in 
that time face and boldly began to his plan of 
the lines of between and came from those and knew 
the country well his plan seemed a good one especially 
from the strength of conviction with which he spoke kutuzov 
looked down at his own legs occasionally glancing at the 
door of the adjoining as if expecting something unpleasant to 
from it and from that while was speaking a general 
with a under his arm really did appear   
said kutuzov in the midst of  you ready so 
soon   your serene replied the general  kutuzov 
swayed his head as much as to say  is 
one man to deal with it all and again listened 
to   give my word of honor as a 
officer said  i can napoleon line of   
relation are you to general asked kutuzov interrupting him  
 is my uncle your   we were friends 
said kutuzov  right all right friend stay here at 
the staff and tomorrow we have a talk  with 
a nod to he turned away and put out his 
hand for the papers had brought him   not 
your serene like to come inside said the general on 
duty in a voice  must be examined and several 
papers have to be  an adjutant came out and 
announced that everything was in within but kutuzov evidently did 
not wish to enter that room till he was he 
made a grimace   tell them to bring a 
small table out here my dear boy i look at 
them here said he  go away he added turning 
to prince andrew who remained in the porch and listened 
to the general report  while this was being given 
prince andrew heard the whisper of a woman voice and 
the rustle of a silk dress behind the door several 
times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door 
a plump rosy handsome woman in a pink dress with 
a silk on her head holding a dish and evidently 
awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief kutuzov adjutant 
whispered to prince andrew that this was the wife of 
the whose home it was and that she intended to 
his serene and  husband has his serene with the 
cross at the and she to him in the house 
she very pretty added the adjutant with a smile at 
those words kutuzov looked round he was listening to the 
general report chiefly of a of the position at he 
had listened to and seven years had listened to the 
at the of war he evidently listened only because he 
had ears which though there was a piece of in 
one of them could not help hearing but it was 
evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or 
even interest him that he knew all that would be 
said and heard it all only because he had to 
as one has to listen to the of a service 
of all that had said was clever and to the 
point what the general was saying was even more clever 
and to the point but it was evident that kutuzov 
knowledge and and knew of something else that would decide 
the matter of and knowledge prince andrew watched the commander 
in chief face attentively and the only expression he could 
see there was one of curiosity as to the meaning 
of the feminine behind the door and a desire to 
observe it was evident that kutuzov and learning and even 
the feeling shown by but them not because of his 
own or knowledge did not try to display any of 
these because of something else he them because of his 
old age and experience of life the only kutuzov gave 
of his own accord during that report to by the 
russian at the end of the report the general put 
before him for a paper to the of from army 
for green down by the soldiers when petitions for  
after hearing the matter kutuzov his lips together and shook 
his head   the into the fire with it 
i tell you once for all my dear fellow said 
he  the fire with all such things let them 
cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts i 
don order it or allow it but i don either 
one can get on without it  wood is the 
will fly he looked at the paper again  this 
german precision he muttered shaking his head    
  chapter xvi    that all said 
kutuzov as he the last of the and rising heavily 
and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck 
he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression 
 the wife flushing rosy red caught up the dish 
she had after all not managed to present at the 
right moment though she had so long been preparing for 
it and with a low bow offered it to kutuzov 
 he screwed up his eyes smiled lifted her with 
his hand and said   what a beauty thank 
you  he took some gold from his and put 
them on the dish for her  my dear and 
how are we getting on he asked moving to the 
door of the room assigned to him the wife smiled 
and with in her rosy followed him into the room 
the adjutant came out to the porch and asked prince 
andrew to with him half an hour later prince andrew 
was again called to kutuzov he found him in an 
armchair still in the same he had in his hand 
a french book which he closed as prince andrew entered 
the place with a prince andrew saw by the that 
it was by madame de genlis   sit down 
sit down here let have a talk said kutuzov  
sad very sad but remember my dear fellow that i 
am a father to you a second father  prince 
andrew told kutuzov all he knew of his father death 
and what he had seen at bald hills when he 
passed through it   what they have brought us 
to kutuzov suddenly cried in an agitated voice evidently to 
himself from prince andrew story the condition russia was in 
 give me time give me time he said with 
a look evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation 
and added  sent for you to keep you with 
me   thank your serene but i fear i 
am no longer fit for the staff replied prince andrew 
with a smile which kutuzov noticed  kutuzov glanced inquiringly 
at him   above all added prince andrew  
have grown used to my regiment am fond of the 
officers and i fancy the men also like me i 
should be sorry to leave the regiment if i the 
honor of being with you believe me  a kindly 
yet expression lit up kutuzov face he cut bolkonski short 
  am sorry for i need you but you 
right you right it not here that men are are 
always but men are not the would not be what 
they are if the would served there as you do 
i remember you at i remember yes i remember you 
with the said kutuzov and a of pleasure prince andrew 
face at this  taking his hand and drawing him 
downwards kutuzov offered his to be kissed and again prince 
andrew noticed tears in the old man eyes though prince 
andrew knew that kutuzov tears came easily and that he 
was particularly tender to and of him from a wish 
to show sympathy with his yet this of was both 
pleasant and to him   your way and god 
be with you i know your path is the path 
of honor he paused  you at but i someone 
to send and changing the subject kutuzov began to speak 
of the turkish war and the peace that had been 
concluded  i have been much he said  for 
that war and the peace but everything came at the 
right time a point a qui  and there were 
as many there as here he went on returning to 
the subject of  which evidently occupied him  those 
said he  we had listened to them all we 
should not have made peace with and should not have 
been through with that war everything in but more less 
speed would have been lost if he had not died 
he with thirty thousand men it is not difficult to 
a but it is difficult to a for that not 
and but patience and time are wanted sent soldiers to 
but i only employed these two things and took more 
than and made them eat he swayed his head  
the french shall too believe me he went on growing 
warmer and his chest  make them eat and tears 
again his eyes        
 comes in time to him who knows how to 
wait    we have to accept battle remarked 
prince andrew   shall if everybody wants it it 
can be helped but believe me my dear boy there 
is nothing than those two patience and time they will 
do it all but the de le  some want 
a thing don what one to do he asked evidently 
expecting an answer  what do you want us to 
do he repeated and his eye shone with a deep 
look  tell you what to do he continued as 
prince andrew still did not reply  will tell you 
what to do and what i do le mon cher 
he paused   the french proverb deliberately   
       see it that 
way that the trouble       
   in doubt my dear fellow do nothing 
   good my dear fellow remember that with 
all my heart i your sorrow and that for you 
i am not a serene nor a prince nor a 
commander in chief but a father if you want anything 
come straight to me good my dear boy  again 
he embraced and kissed prince andrew but before the latter 
had left the room kutuzov gave a sigh of relief 
and went on with his by madame de genlis  
prince andrew could not have explained how or why it 
was but after that interview with kutuzov he went back 
to his regiment as to the general course of affairs 
and as to the man to whom it had been 
the more he realized the of all motive in that 
old man whom there seemed to remain only the habit 
of and in place of an  and drawing only 
the capacity to the course of more he was that 
everything would be as it should  will not bring 
in any plan of his own he will not or 
anything thought prince andrew  he will hear everything remember 
everything and put everything in its place he will not 
anything nor allow anything he that there is something and 
more important than his own will course of and he 
can see them and their and seeing that can refrain 
from meddling and his wish to something else and above 
all thought prince andrew  in him because he russian 
despite the by genlis and the french and because his 
voice shook when he said  they have brought us 
to and had a sob in it when he said 
he would  them eat  on such more or 
less by all the and general approval were with which 
despite court the popular choice of kutuzov as commander in 
chief was received      chapter xvii 
  after the emperor had left moscow life on 
there in its usual course and its course was so 
very usual that it was difficult to remember the days 
of and hard to believe that russia was really in 
danger and that the members of the english club were 
also sons of the ready to sacrifice everything for it 
the one thing that recalled the everyone had during the 
emperor stay was the call for of men and money 
a necessity that as soon as the promises had been 
made assumed a official form and became  with the 
to moscow the of their situation did not grow more 
serious but on the contrary became even more as always 
happens with people who see a great danger approaching at 
the of danger there are always two voices that speak 
with equal power in the human soul one very tells 
a man to consider the nature of the danger and 
the means of escaping it the other still more says 
that it is too and painful to think of the 
danger since it is not in man power to everything 
and the general course of and it is therefore better 
to what is painful till it comes and to think 
about what is pleasant in a man generally to the 
first voice but in society to the second so it 
was now with the of moscow it was long since 
people had been as gay in moscow as that year 
 by of a drink a and a moscow called 
 been a and having had rather too much at 
the that napoleon wished to come to moscow grew angry 
the french in very bad language came out of the 
drink and under the sign of the began to the 
assembled people were read and discussed together with the latest 
of vasili  in the corner room at the club 
members gathered to read these and some liked the way 
at the french saying  will up with russian burst 
with our and themselves with they are all and one 
woman will three of them with a others did not 
like that tone and said it was stupid and it 
was said that had expelled all and even all from 
moscow and that there had been some and of napoleon 
among them but this was told chiefly to introduce witty 
remark on that occasion the were to by boat and 
had said to them in french  la une de 
 there was talk of all the government having been 
already removed from moscow and to this shinshin was added 
for that alone moscow ought to be grateful to napoleon 
it was said that regiment would cost him eight hundred 
thousand rubles and that bezukhov had spent even more on 
his but that the best thing about bezukhov was that 
he himself was going to don a uniform and ride 
at the head of his regiment without anything for the 
show          
it over get into the and take care not to 
     make it a of  
  don spare anyone said julie drubetskaya as she 
and pressed together a of with her thin fingers  
julie was preparing to leave moscow next day and was 
giving a soiree   est but he is so 
kind and good what pleasure is there to be so 
  cried a young man in uniform whom julie 
called  and who was going with her to  
in julie set as in many other in moscow it 
had been agreed that they would speak nothing but russian 
and that those who made a slip and spoke french 
should pay to the of   for a said 
a russian who was present  pleasure is there to 
be is not russian   spare no one continued 
julie to the young man without heeding the remark

kissing his hostess hand and taking a seat beside her 
 am so of it   will of course 
command it yourself said julie a sly sarcastic glance toward 
the officer  the latter in pierre presence had ceased 
to be caustic and his face expressed as to what 
julie smile might mean in spite of his absent and 
good nature pierre immediately checked any to him to his 
face   said pierre with a laughing glance at 
his big stout body  should make too good a 
for the french besides i am afraid i should hardly 
be able to climb onto a horse  among those 
whom julie guests happened to choose to gossip about were 
the rostovs   hear that their affairs are in 
a very bad way said julie  he is so 
the count himself i mean the razumovskis wanted to buy 
his house and his near moscow but it on and

a knowing smile   are waiting for their younger 
son pierre replied  joined and went to where the

transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day 
the count wanted to leave long ago but the countess 
won on any account leave moscow till her son returns 
  met them the day before yesterday at the 
arkharovs has her looks and is she sang a song 
how easily some people get over everything   over 
what inquired pierre looking  julie smiled   know

d

now count you know   don know anything about

dear vera   madame pierre continued in a tone 
of  have not taken on myself the role of 
rostova at all and have not been to their house 
for nearly a month but i cannot understand the  
  said julie smiling and the and to have 
the last word she changed the subject  you know 
what i heard today poor mary bolkonskaya arrived in moscow 
yesterday do you know that she has lost her father 
        himself himself

 you know i really believe she is un peu 
         little

  how could one say that in russian

returned home he was two of that had been brought 
that day  the first declared that the report that 
count had people to leave moscow was on the contrary 
he was glad that ladies and were leaving the city

i will stake my life on it that will not

time that the french would enter moscow the second that 
our were at that count had the french but that 
as many of the of moscow wished to be were 
ready for them at the and which could be had 
at a low the tone of the was not as 
as in the former pierre pondered over these evidently the 
terrible he had desired with the whole strength of his 
soul but which yet involuntary horror in him was drawing 
near   i join the army and enter the 
service or wait he asked himself for the time he 
took a of cards that lay on the table and 
began to lay them out for a game of patience 
  this patience comes out he said to himself 
after the cards holding them in his hand and lifting 
his head  it comes out it means what does 
it mean  he had not decided what it should 
mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess 
at the door asking whether she might come in  
 it will mean that i must go to the 
army said pierre to himself  in come in he 
added to the princess  only the eldest princess the 
one with the face and long was still living in 
pierre house the two younger ones had both married  
 my coming to you cousin she said in a 
and agitated voice  know some decision must be come 
to what is going to happen everyone has left moscow 
and the people are how is it that we are 
staying on   the contrary things seem ma said 
pierre in the tone he adopted toward her always feeling 
uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor   indeed 
very ivanovna told me today how our are themselves it 
certainly does them and the people too are quite no 
longer obey even my maid has taken to being at 
this rate they will soon begin us one can walk 
in the but above all the french will be here 
any day now so what are we waiting for i 
ask just one thing of you cousin she went on 
 for me to be taken to petersburg i may 
be i can live under bonaparte rule   come 
ma where do you get your information from on the 
contrary   won to your napoleon others may if 
they please if you don want to do this  
 i will i give the order at once  
the princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to 
be angry with muttering to herself she sat down on 
a chair   you have been said pierre  
is quiet in the city and there is not the 
slightest danger see i just been reading he showed her 
the  writes that he will stake his life on 
it that the will not enter moscow   that 
count of yours said the princess  is a a 
who has himself roused the people to didn he write 
in those that anyone  it might be should be 
to the by his hair  silly  honor and 
glory to whoever him he says this is what his 
has brought us to ivanovna told me the near killed 
her because she said something in french   but 
it so you take everything so to heart said pierre 
and began laying out his cards for patience  although 
that patience did come out pierre did not join the 
army but remained in deserted moscow ever in the same 
state of agitation and alarm yet at the same time 
joyfully expecting something terrible  next day toward evening the 
princess set off and pierre head came to inform him 
that the money for the equipment of his regiment could 
not be found without one of the estates in general 
the head made out to pierre that his of raising 
a regiment would him pierre listened to him scarcely able 
to a smile   then sell it said he 
 to be done i can draw back now  
the worse everything became especially his own affairs the better 
was pierre pleased and the more evident was it that 
the he expected was approaching hardly anyone he knew was 
left in town julie had gone and so had princess 
mary of his intimate friends only the rostovs remained but 
he did not go to see them  to his 
thoughts he drove that day to the village of to 
see the great was to the foe and a that 
was to go up next day the was not yet 
ready but pierre learned that it was being by the 
emperor desire the emperor had written to count as follows 
  as soon as is ready get together a 
of and intelligent men for his car and send a 
courier to general kutuzov to let him know i have 
him of the matter  please upon to be very 
where he for the first time that he may not 
make a mistake and fall into the hands it is 
essential for him to his movements with those of the 
commander in chief   on his way home from 
as he was passing the place pierre seeing a large 
crowd round the place stopped and got out of his 
trap a french cook of being a was being the 
was only just over and the was from the a 
stout man with red in blue stockings and a green 
jacket who was another thin and pale stood near by 
their faces they were both with a frightened and suffering 
look that on the thin frenchman face pierre pushed his 
way in through the crowd   is it who 
is it what is it for he kept asking  
but the attention of the crowd and women in cloaks 
and in so eagerly on what was passing in place 
that no one answered him the stout man rose frowned 
shrugged his shoulders and evidently trying to appear firm began 
to pull on his jacket without looking about him but 
suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry in 
the way full grown men cry though angry with himself 
for doing so in the crowd people began talking loudly 
to their of pity as it seemed to pierre  
 cook to some prince   russian seems to 
be to a frenchman sets his teeth on edge said 
a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind pierre when the 
frenchman began to cry  the clerk glanced round evidently 
that his joke would be appreciated some people began to 
laugh others continued to watch in dismay the who was 
the other man  pierre his face puckered and he 
turned hastily away went back to his trap muttering something 
to himself as he went and took his seat as 
they drove along he and exclaimed several times so that 
the asked him   is your pleasure   
are you going shouted pierre to the man who was 
to street   the as you ordered answered the 
  idiot shouted pierre his thing he did  
i told you and drive  must get away this 
very day he murmured to himself  at the sight 
of the frenchman and the crowd the place pierre had 
so made up his mind that he could no longer 
remain in moscow and would leave for the army that 
very day that it seemed to him that either he 
had told the this or that the man ought to 
have known it for himself  on reaching home pierre 
gave orders to head who knew everything could do anything 
and was known to all moscow he would leave that 
night for the army at and that his horses should 
be sent there this could not all be arranged that 
day so on pierre had to put off his till 
next day to allow time for the horses to be 
sent on in  on the twenty the weather up 
after a spell of rain and after dinner pierre left 
moscow when changing horses that night in he learned that 
there had been a great battle that evening  was 
the battle of he was told that there in the 
earth trembled from the but could answer his questions as 
to who had won at dawn next day pierre was 
approaching  every house in had soldiers in it and 
at the where pierre was met by his and there 
was no room to be had it was full of 
officers  everywhere in and it were or on the 
march foot and horse soldiers and were everywhere pierre pushed 
forward as fast as he could and the farther he 
left moscow behind and the deeper he into that sea 
of the more was he by agitation and a new 
and joyful feeling he had not experienced before it was 
a feeling to what he had felt at the during 
the emperor visit sense of the necessity of something and 
something he now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that 
constitutes men happiness of life wealth even life itself it 
is pleasant to throw away with something with what pierre 
could not say and he did not try to for 
whom and for what he felt such particular in everything 
he was not occupied with the question of what to 
sacrifice for the fact of in itself him a new 
and joyous      chapter xix  
 on the twenty of august the battle of the 
was fought on the twenty not a was by either 
side and on the twenty the battle of itself took 
place  why and how were the of and given 
and why was the battle of fought there was not 
the least sense in it for either the french or 
the russians its result for the russians was and was 
to be that we were brought nearer to the of 
moscow we feared more than anything in the world and 
for the french its result was that they were brought 
nearer to the of their whole army they feared more 
than anything in the world what the result must be 
was quite obvious and yet napoleon offered and kutuzov that 
battle  if the had been by reason it would 
seem that it must have been obvious to napoleon that 
by thirteen hundred and giving battle with a of losing 
a of his army he was to certain and it 
must have been clear to kutuzov that by battle and 
the of a of his army he would certainly lose 
moscow for kutuzov this was clear as it is that 
if when playing i have one man less and go 
on exchanging i shall certainly lose and therefore should not 
when my has sixteen men and i have fourteen i 
am only one than he but when i have exchanged 
thirteen more men he will be three times as strong 
as i am  before the battle of our strength 
in proportion to the french was about as five to 
six but after that battle it was little more than 
one to two we had a hundred thousand against a 
hundred and twenty thousand afterwards little more than fifty thousand 
against a hundred thousand yet the and experienced kutuzov the 
battle while napoleon who was said to be a commander 
of gave it losing a of his army and his 
lines of still more if it is said that he 
expected to end the by occupying moscow as he had 
ended a previous by occupying vienna there is much to 
the contrary napoleon themselves tell us that from he wished 
to stop knew the danger of his position and knew 
that the occupation of moscow would not be the end 
of the for he had seen at the state in 
which russian were left to him and had not received 
a single reply to his repeated of his wish to 
 in giving and battle at kutuzov acted and but 
later on to fit what had occurred the of the 
and of the who of all the of history were 
the most and involuntary  the have left us model 
in which the the whole interest of the story and 
we are still unable to ourselves to the fact that 
for our of that kind are meaningless  on the 
other question how the battle of and the battle of 
were fought there also a definite and well but quite 
all the describe the affair as follows  the russian 
army they say in its from out for itself the 
best position for a general and found such a position 
at  the russians they say this position in on 
the left of the  moscow to and almost at 
a right angle to it from to at the very 
place where the battle was fought  in front of 
this position they say a was set up on the 
to observe the on the twenty we are told napoleon 
attacked this post and took it and on the twenty 
attacked the whole russian army which was in position on 
the field of  so the say and it is 
all quite wrong as anyone who cares to look into 
the matter can easily himself  the russians did not 
out the best position but on the contrary during the 
passed many positions better than they did not stop at 
any one of these positions because kutuzov did not wish 
to a position he had not himself because the popular 
demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly 
enough and because had not yet arrived with the and 
for many other reasons the fact is that other positions 
they had passed were and that the position at  
one where the battle was fought far from being strong 
was no more a position than any other spot one 
might find in the russian empire by sticking a into 
the map at  not only did the russians not 
the position on the field of to the left of 
and at a right angle to the  is the 
position on which the battle took place but never till 
the twenty of august  did they think that a 
battle might be fought there this was shown first by 
the fact that there were no there by the twenty 
and that those on the twenty and twenty were not 
and by the position of the that was quite in 
front of the position where the battle was why was 
it more strongly than any other post and why were 
all exhausted and six thousand men to defend it till 
late at night on the twenty a cossack would have 
to observe the as that the position on which the 
battle was fought had not been and that the was 
not an post of that position we have the fact 
that up to the twenty de and were convinced that 
the was the left of the position and that kutuzov 
himself in his report written in hot after the battle 
of the as the left of the position it was 
much later when reports on the battle of were written 
at that the and extraordinary statement was  to justify 
the of a commander in chief who had to be 
as that the was an post in it was simply 
a point on the left that the battle of was 
fought by us on an position where as it was 
fought on a quite spot which was almost  the 
case was evidently this a position was along the river 
the not at a right angle but at an angle 
that the left was at the right near the village 
of and the center at at the of the and 
 to anyone who looks at the field of without 
thinking of how the battle was fought this position by 
the river itself as obvious for an army whose object 
was to prevent an from along the road to moscow 
 napoleon to on the twenty did not see  
the history say he did the position of the russians 
from to  could not have seen that position because 
it did not exist nor did he see an post 
of the russian army but while the russian he came 
upon the left of the russian position the unexpectedly for 
the russians moved his army across the and the russians 
not having time to begin a general their left from 
the position they had intended to and took up a 
new position which had not been and was not by 
crossing to the other side of the to the left 
of the napoleon the whole battle from right to left 
 from the russian side and transferred it to the 
plain between and plain no more advantageous as a position 
than any other plain in russia there the whole battle 
of the twenty of august took place  had napoleon 
not out on the evening of the twenty to the 
and had he not then ordered an attack on the 
but had the attack next morning no one would have 
that the was the left of our position and the 
battle would have taken place where we expected it in 
that case we should probably have the left more we 
should have attacked napoleon in the center or on the 
right and the would have taken place on the twenty 
in the position we intended and had but as the 
attack on our left took place in the evening after 
the of our  is immediately after the fight at 
and as the russian did not wish or were not 
in time to begin a general then on the evening 
of the twenty the first and chief of the battle 
of was already lost on the twenty and obviously led 
to the of the one fought on the twenty  
after the of the we found ourselves on the morning 
of the twenty without a position for our left and 
were forced to it back and hastily it where it 
to be  not only was the russian army on 
the twenty by weak but the of that position was 
by the fact that the russian having fully realized what 
had happened the of our position on the left and 
the of the whole field of the battle from right 
to left their position from the village of to and 
had to move their forces from right to left during 
the battle so it happened that the whole battle the 
russians the french army against our left with but half 
as many men  against and on the right against 
the french were actions distinct from the main course of 
the battle so the battle of did not take place 
at all as  an effort to our even at 
the cost of the glory to the russian army and 
people it has been described the battle of was not 
fought on a and position with forces only slightly than 
those of the but as a result of the of 
the the russians fought the battle of on an open 
and almost position with forces only half as as the 
french that is to say under in which it was 
not merely to fight for ten hours and secure an 
result but to keep an army even from complete and 
flight      chapter xx   
on the morning of the twenty pierre was leaving at 
the of the high hill down which a road led 
out of the town past the on the right where 
a service was being held and the were ringing pierre 
got out of his and on foot behind him a 
cavalry regiment was coming down the hill by its coming 
up toward him was a train of carrying men who 
had been in the the day before the shouting and 
their horses kept crossing from side to side the in 
each of which three or four soldiers were lying or 
sitting over the stones that had been thrown on the 
to make it something like a road the with with 
pale compressed lips and brows held on to the sides 
of the as they were against one another almost all 
of them stared with naive childlike curiosity at pierre white 
hat and green swallow coat  pierre shouted angrily at 
the of to keep to one side of the road 
the cavalry regiment as it the hill with its pierre 
carriage and the road pierre stopped being pressed against the 
side of the in which the road ran the from 
behind the hill did not into the and there it 
was cold and but above pierre head was the bright 
august and the sounded merrily one of the with stopped 
by the side of the road close to pierre the 
in his shoes ran up to it placed a stone 
under one of its wheels and began arranging the on 
his little horse  one of the an old with 
a arm who was following the on foot caught hold 
of it with his sound hand and turned to look 
at pierre   say fellow will they set us 
down here or take us on to moscow he asked 
 pierre was so deep in thought that he did 
not hear the question he was looking now at the 
cavalry regiment that had met the of now at the 
by which he was standing in which two men were 
sitting and one was lying one of those sitting up 
in the had probably been in the his whole head 
was wrapped in and one was to the size of 
a baby head his nose and mouth were to one 
side this was looking at the and crossing himself another 
a young lad a fair as white as though there 
was no blood in his thin face looked at pierre 
kindly with a fixed smile the third lay so that 
his face was not visible the cavalry were passing close 
by     ah lost quite lost is 
my head so    living in a foreign 
land  they sang their soldiers dance song  as 
if to them but with a different sort of the 
sound of the high above and the hot of the 
sun the top of the opposite with yet another sort 
of but beneath the by the with the near the 
little where pierre stood it was and sad  the 
with the looked angrily at the cavalry   the 
he muttered   not the soldiers only but i 
seen today too the they have to go said the 
behind the addressing pierre with a sad smile  made 
they want the whole nation to fall on them a 
word it moscow they want to make an end of 
it  in spite of the of the words pierre 
understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval  
the road was clear again pierre the hill and drove 
on  he kept looking to either side of the 
road for familiar faces but only saw everywhere the faces 
of military men of different branches of the service who 
all looked with at his white hat and green tail 
coat  having gone nearly three he at last met 
an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him this was one of 
the head army doctors he was toward pierre in a 
covered sitting beside a young and on pierre he told 
the cossack who occupied the seat to pull up  
 your excellency how come you to be here asked 
the doctor   you know i wanted to see 
  yes there will be something to see  
pierre got out and talked to the doctor explaining his 
intention of taking part in a battle  the doctor 
him to apply direct to kutuzov   should you 
be god knows where out of sight during the battle 
he said exchanging glances with his young companion  his 
serene knows you and will receive you graciously that what 
you must do  the doctor seemed tired and in 
a   think so ah i also wanted to 
ask you where our position is exactly said pierre  
 position repeated the doctor  that not my line 
drive past a lot of is going on there go 
up the and you see   one see from 
there if you would  but the doctor interrupted him 
and moved toward his   would go with you 
but on my honor i up to here he pointed 
to his  to the commander of the corps how 
do matters stand you know count there be a battle 
tomorrow out of an army of a hundred thousand we 
must expect at least twenty thousand and we haven or 
or or doctors enough for six thousand we have ten 
thousand but we need other things as well must manage 
as best we can  the strange thought that of 
the thousands of men young and old who had stared 
with merry surprise at his hat  the very men 
he had noticed twenty thousand were to and death pierre 
  may die tomorrow why are they thinking of 
anything but death and by some of thought the of 
the hill the with the the ringing the of the 
sun and the of the to his mind   
cavalry ride to battle and meet the and do not 
for a moment think of what them but pass by 
winking at the yet from among these men twenty thousand 
are to die and they wonder at my hat strange 
thought pierre continuing his way to  in front of 
a house to the left of the road stood carriages 
and of and the commander in chief was putting up 
there but just when pierre arrived he was not in 
and hardly any of the staff were there had gone 
to the service pierre drove on toward  when he 
had ascended the hill and reached the little village street 
he saw for the first time in their white and 
with on their who talking and laughing loudly animated and 
were at work on a huge with grass to the 
right of the road  some of them were others 
were of earth along while others stood about doing nothing 
 two officers were standing on the the men on 
seeing these who were evidently still amused by the of 
their position as soldiers pierre once more thought of the 
men at and understood what the had meant when he 
said  want the whole nation to fall on them 
the sight of these at work on the with their 
queer clumsy and and their opening from the left toward 
the middle unfastened their pierre more strongly with the solemnity 
and importance of the moment than anything he had yet 
seen or heard      chapter  
 pierre stepped out of his carriage and passing the 
ascended the from which to the doctor the could be 
seen  it was about o the sun shone to 
the left and behind him and lit up the enormous 
which rising like an before him in the clear  
from above on the left that wound the passing through 
a village with a white some five hundred in front 
of the and below it this was below the village 
the road the river by a bridge and down and 
up rose higher and higher to the village of visible 
about four away where napoleon was then the road into 
a forest on the far in the distance in that 
and forest to the right of the road the cross 
and of the in the sun here and there over 
the whole of that blue to right and left of 
the forest and the road smoking could be seen and 
of and the the ground to the right the course 
of the and broken and between the the of and 
showed in the distance on the left the ground was 
more there were of and the smoking of which had 
been down could be seen  all that pierre saw 
was so that neither the left nor the right side 
of the field fully satisfied his expectations nowhere could he 
see the he had expected to find but only the 
smoke of and and try as he would he could 
no military  in this place which with life nor 
could he even distinguish our from the   must 
ask someone who knows he thought and addressed an officer 
who was looking with curiosity at his huge figure  
 i ask you said pierre  village that is 
in front   isn it said the officer turning 
to his companion   the other him  the 
officer evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk moved 
up to pierre   those our men there pierre 
inquired   and there further on are the french 
said the officer  they are there you can see 
them   where asked pierre   can see 
them with the eye why there  the officer pointed 
with his hand to the smoke visible on the left 
the river and the same stern and serious expression that 
pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had 
met came into his face   those are the 
french and over there pierre pointed to a on the 
left near which some could be seen   are 
ours   ours and there pierre pointed to another 
in the distance with a big tree on it near 
a village that lay in a hollow where also some 
were smoking and something black was visible   his 
again said the officer  was the  was ours 
yesterday but now it is his   how about 
our position   position replied the officer with a 
smile of satisfaction  can tell you quite clearly because 
i nearly all our there you see there our center 
at just there and he pointed to the village in 
front of them with the white  where one the 
you see down there where the rows of are lying 
in the hollow there the bridge that our center our 
right is over there pointed to the right far away 
in the broken ground where the river is and we 
have thrown up three there very strong ones the left 
here the officer paused  you see that difficult to 
explain yesterday our left was there at you see where 
the oak is but now we have our left it 
is over there do you see that village and the 
smoke that yes there he pointed to  the battle 
will hardly be there his having moved his there is 
only a he will probably pass round to the right 
of the but wherever it may be many a man 
will be missing tomorrow he remarked  an elderly who 
had approached the officer while he was giving these had 
waited in silence for him to finish speaking but at 
this point evidently not the officer remark interrupted him  
 must be sent for said he sternly  the 
officer appeared as though he understood that one might think 
of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought 
not to speak of it   send number three 
company again the officer replied hurriedly   you are 
you one of the doctors   i come on 
my own answered pierre and he went down the hill 
again passing the   those fellows muttered the officer 
who followed him holding his nose as he ran past 
the men at work   they are bringing her 
coming there they are they be here in a minute 
voices were suddenly heard saying and officers soldiers and began 
running forward along the road  a was coming up 
the hill from first along the road came the infantry 
in ranks and with arms from behind them came the 
sound of  soldiers and ran past pierre toward the 
  are bringing her our the mother of god 
someone cried   mother of god another him  
the both those who had been in the village and 
those who had been at work on the threw down 
their and ran to meet the following the that along 
the road came in their little old man in a 
with and behind them soldiers and officers bore a large 
dark with an metal this was the that had been 
brought from and had since accompanied the army behind before 
and on both sides of with heads walked ran and 
bowed to the ground  at the of the hill 
they stopped with the the men who had been holding 
it up by the linen attached to it were relieved 
by others the their and service began the hot of 
the sun beat down and a fresh soft wind played 
with the hair of the heads and with the ribbons 
the the did not sound loud under the open sky 
an immense crowd of officers soldiers and the behind the 
and a stood the on a spot for them a 
bald general with a st george cross on his neck 
stood just behind the back and without crossing himself  
was evidently a german the end of the service which 
he considered it necessary to hear to the end probably 
to the of the russian people another general stood in 
a crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of 
his chest while looking about him standing among the crowd 
of pierre recognized several among these but did not look 
at them whole attention was in watching the serious expression 
on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and who 
were all gazing eagerly at the as soon as the 
tired who were the service for the time that day 
began and to sing  from o mother of god 
and the and chimed in  to thee under god 
we all as to an and there again in all 
those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity 
of the moment that pierre had seen on the faces 
at the foot of the hill at and on many 
and many faces he had met that morning and heads 
were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back and and 
the sound men made as they themselves were heard  
the crowd round the suddenly and pressed against pierre someone 
a very important by the with which way was made 
for him was approaching the  it was kutuzov who 
had been round the position and on his way back 
to had stopped where the service was being held pierre 
recognized him at once by his peculiar figure which distinguished 
him from everybody else  with a long on his 
exceedingly stout round body with white head and face showing 
the white ball of the eye he had lost kutuzov 
walked with swaying into the crowd and stopped behind the 
he himself with an accustomed movement bent till he touched 
the ground with his hand and bowed his white head 
with a deep sigh behind kutuzov was and the despite 
the presence of the commander in chief who the attention 
of all the superior officers the and soldiers continued their 
without looking at him  when the service was over 
kutuzov stepped up to the heavily to his knees bowed 
to the ground and for a long time tried to 
rise but could not do so on account of his 
weakness and weight his white head with the effort at 
last he rose kissed the as a child does with 
naively lips and again bowed till he touched the ground 
with his hand the other followed his example then the 
officers and after them with faces pressing on one another 
crowding and pushing the soldiers and     
 chapter   amid the crush pierre looked about 
him   peter how did you get here said 
a voice  pierre looked round boris his knees with 
his hand  had probably them when he too had 
before the came up to him smiling boris was dressed 
with a slightly touch appropriate to a he wore a 
long coat and like kutuzov had a across his shoulder 
 meanwhile kutuzov had reached the village and seated himself 
in the of the house on a which one cossack 
had run to and another had hastily covered with a 
an immense and brilliant him  the was carried further 
accompanied by the pierre stopped some thirty from kutuzov talking 
to boris  he explained his wish to be present 
at the battle and to see the position   
is what you must do said boris  will do 
the of the to you you will see everything best 
from where count will be i am in on him 
you know i mention it to him but if you 
want to ride round the position come along with us 
we are just going to the left then when we 
get back do spend the night with me and we 
arrange a game of cards of course you know dmitri 
sergeevich those are his and he pointed to the third 
house in the village of   i should like 
to see the right they say it very strong said 
pierre  should like to start from the river and 
ride round the whole position   you can do 
that later but the chief thing is the left  
 yes but where is prince bolkonski regiment can you 
point it out to me   andrew we shall 
pass it and i take you to him   
about the left asked pierre   tell you the 
truth between ourselves god only knows what state our left 
is in said boris lowering his voice  is not 
at all what count intended he meant to that quite 
differently but boris shrugged his shoulders  serene would not 
have it or someone him you see but boris did 
not finish for at that moment kutuzov adjutant came up 
to pierre  said boris addressing him with an smile 
 was just trying to explain our position to the 
count it is how his serene could so the intentions 
of the french   mean the left asked  
 exactly the left is now strong  though kutuzov 
had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff boris had 
to remain at after the he had himself with count 
who like all on whom boris had been in considered 
young prince an man  in the higher command there 
were two parties kutuzov party and that of the chief 
of staff boris belonged to the latter and no one 
else while showing respect to kutuzov could so create an 
that the old fellow was not much good and that 
managed everything now the moment of battle had come when 
kutuzov would be destroyed and the power pass to or 
even if kutuzov won the battle it would be felt 
that everything was done by in any case many great 
would have to be given for tomorrow and new men 
would come to the front so boris was full of 
nervous all day  after others whom pierre knew came 
up to him and he had not time to reply 
to all the questions about moscow that were upon him 
or to listen to all that was told him the 
faces all expressed animation and but it seemed to pierre 
that the cause of the excitement shown in some of 
these faces lay chiefly in questions of success his mind 
however was occupied by the different expression he saw on 
other faces expression that spoke not of matters but of 
the questions of life and death kutuzov noticed pierre figure 
and the group gathered round him   him to 
me said kutuzov  an adjutant told pierre of his 
serene wish and pierre went toward kutuzov but a got 
there before him it was dolokhov   did that 
fellow get here asked pierre   a creature that 
in anywhere was the answer  has been degraded you 
know now he wants to up again he been some 
scheme or other and has into the line at night 
he a fellow  pierre took off his hat and 
bowed respectfully to kutuzov   concluded that if i 
to your serene you might send me away or say 
that you knew what i was but then i lose 
anything dolokhov was saying   yes   if 
i were right i should be a service to my 
for which i am ready to die   yes 
  should your serene a man who will not 
spare his skin please think of me perhaps i may 
prove to your serene   yes kutuzov repeated his 
laughing eye more and more as he looked at pierre 
 just then boris with his courtierlike stepped up to 
pierre side near kutuzov and in a most natural manner 
without raising his voice said to pierre as though continuing 
an interrupted conversation   have put on clean white 
to be ready to die what count  boris evidently 
said this to pierre in order to be by his 
serene he knew kutuzov attention would be caught by those 
words and so it was   are you saying 
about the he asked boris   for tomorrow your 
serene death have put on clean   a wonderful 
a people said kutuzov and he closed his eyes and 
swayed his head  people he repeated with a sigh 
  you want to smell he said to pierre 
 it a pleasant smell i have the honor to 
be one of your wife is she well my are 
at your service  and as often happens with old 
people kutuzov began looking about absent as if forgetting all 
he wanted to say or do  then evidently what 
he wanted he to andrew his adjutant brother   
verses those verses of how do they go eh those 
he wrote about  for the corps them them said 
he evidently preparing to laugh  kutuzov smilingly nodded his 
head to the rhythm of the verses  when pierre 
had left kutuzov dolokhov came up to him and took 
his hand   am very glad to meet you 
here count he said aloud of the presence of and 
in a particularly resolute and solemn tone  the of 
a day when god alone knows who of us is 
to i am glad of this opportunity to tell you 
that i regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and 
should wish you not to have any ill feeling for 
me i beg you to forgive me  pierre looked 
at dolokhov with a smile not knowing what to say 
to him with tears in his eyes dolokhov embraced pierre 
and kissed him  boris said a few words to 
his general and count turned to pierre and that he 
should ride with him along the line   will 
interest you said he   very much replied pierre 
 half an hour later kutuzov left for and and 
his with pierre among them set out on their ride 
along the line      chapter  
 from the to the bridge which when they had 
looked at it from the hill the officer had pointed 
out as being the center of our position and where 
rows of new lay by the they across that bridge 
into the village of and turned to the left passing 
an enormous number of and and came to a high 
where were this was the as yet which afterwards became 
known as the or the but pierre paid no special 
attention to it he did not know that it would 
become more to him than any other spot on the 
plain of  they then the hollow to where the 
soldiers were away the last from the and then they 
and across a trodden and down as if by following 
a made by the over the of the land and 
reached some  which were still being    
    a kind of   at 
the stopped and began looking at the opposite which had 
been ours the day before and where several could be 
the officers said that either napoleon or was there and 
they all gazed eagerly at this little group of pierre 
also looked at them trying to guess which of the 
scarcely was napoleon at last those men away from the 
and  spoke to a general who approached him and 
began explaining the whole position of our pierre listened to 
him each to understand the essential of the battle but 
was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was for 
the task he could make nothing of it stopped speaking 
and noticing that pierre was listening suddenly said to him 
  don think this interests you   the 
contrary it very interesting replied pierre not quite  from 
the they still farther to the left along a road 
through a thick low wood in the middle of the 
wood a brown with white feet out and scared by 
the of the many horses grew so confused that it 
along the road in front of them for some time 
general attention and laughter and only when several voices shouted 
at it did it to one side and in the 
after going through the wood for about a mile and 
a half they came out on a where of corps 
were to defend the left  here at the extreme 
left talked a great deal and with much heat and 
as it seemed to pierre gave orders of great military 
importance in front of was some high ground not occupied 
by loudly this mistake saying that it was to leave 
a height which the country around and to place below 
it some of the expressed the same opinion one in 
particular declared with heat that they were put there to 
be on his own ordered the to the high ground 
this disposition on the left pierre doubt of his own 
capacity to understand military matters listening to and the the 
position of the behind the hill he quite understood them 
and their opinion but for that very reason he could 
not understand how the man who put them there behind 
the hill could have made so and a  pierre 
did not know that these were not as put there 
to defend the position but were in a position as 
an ambush that they should not be seen and might 
be able to an approaching unexpectedly did not know this 
and moved the forward to his own ideas without the 
matter to the commander in chief     
 chapter   on that bright evening of august 
 prince andrew lay on his elbow in a broken 
in the village of at the further end of his 
regiment through a in the broken wall he could see 
beside the a row of thirty year with their lower 
branches off a field on which of were standing and 
some near which rose the smoke of soldiers  and 
and to anyone as his life now seemed to him 
prince andrew on the of battle felt agitated and as 
he had done seven years before at  he had 
received and given the orders for next day battle and 
had nothing more to do but his thoughts simplest and 
therefore most terrible thoughts give him no peace he knew 
that tomorrow battle would be the most terrible of all 
he had taken part in and for the first time 
in his life the of death itself to him in 
relation to any matter or with reference to its effect 
on others but simply in relation to himself to his 
own soul plainly and almost as a and from the 
height of this perception all that had tormented and him 
suddenly became by a cold white light without without without 
of all life appeared to him like at which he 
had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass 
now he suddenly saw those badly in clear and without 
a glass  yes there they are those that agitated 
enraptured and tormented me said he to himself passing in 
the of the of life and regarding them now in 
the cold white of his clear perception of death  
they are those that once seemed splendid and glory the 
good of society love of a woman the itself important 
these appeared to me with what profound meaning they seemed 
to be filled and it is all so simple pale 
and in the cold white light of this morning which 
i feel is for me the three great of his 
life held his attention in particular his love for a 
woman his father death and the french which had half 
russia  that little girl who seemed to me over 
with forces yes indeed i loved her i made of 
love and happiness with her oh what a boy i 
was he said aloud bitterly  me i believed in 
some love which was to keep her faithful to me 
for the whole year of my like the gentle in 
the she was to apart from me but it was 
much really it was all very simple and horrible  
 my father built bald hills he thought the place 
was his his land his air his but napoleon came 
and him aside of his as he might a from 
his path and his bald hills and his whole life 
fell to princess mary says it is a sent from 
above what is the for when he is not here 
and will never return he is not here for whom 
then is the intended the the of moscow and tomorrow 
i shall be killed perhaps not even by a frenchman 
but by one of our own men by a a 
close to my as one of them did yesterday and 
the french will come and take me by head and 
heels and me into a hole that i may not 
under their and new of life will which will seem 
quite ordinary to others and about which i shall know 
nothing i shall not exist  he looked at the 
row of shining in the with their green and and 
white  die to be killed tomorrow that i should 
not exist that all this should still be but no 
me  and the with their light and the curly 
the smoke of the and all that was around him 
changed and seemed terrible and menacing a cold shiver ran 
down his spine he rose quickly went out of the 
and began to walk about  after he had returned 
voices were heard outside the  that he cried  
the red captain dolokhov commander but now from lack of 
officers a commander entered the followed by an adjutant and 
the  prince andrew rose hastily listened to the business 
they had come about gave them some further and was 
about to them when he heard a familiar voice behind 
the   take it said the voice of a 
man stumbling over something  prince andrew looked out of 
the and saw pierre who had over a pole on 
the ground and had nearly coming his way it was 
unpleasant to prince andrew to meet people of his own 
set in general and pierre especially for he reminded him 
of all the painful moments of his last visit to 
moscow   what a surprise said he  you 
here this is  as he said this his eyes 
and face expressed more than expressed which pierre noticed at 
once he had approached the full of animation but on 
seeing prince andrew face he felt and ill at ease 
  have come simply you know come it interests 
me said pierre who had so often that day repeated 
that word   wish to see the battle  
 yes and what do the say about war how 
would they stop it said prince andrew  and how 
moscow and my people have they reached moscow at last 
he asked seriously   they have julie drubetskaya told 
me so i went to see them but them they 
have gone to your near moscow     
 chapter   the officers were about to take 
leave but prince andrew apparently to be left alone with 
his friend asked them to stay and have tea seats 
were brought in and so was the tea the officers 
gazed with surprise at pierre huge stout figure and listened 
to his talk of moscow and the position of our 
army round which he had prince andrew remained silent and 
his expression was so forbidding that pierre addressed his remarks 
chiefly to the good commander   you understand the 
whole position of our prince andrew interrupted him   
is how do you mean said pierre  being a 
military man i can say i have understood it fully 
but i understand the general position   then you 
know more than anyone else be it who it may 
said prince andrew   said pierre looking over his 
spectacles in at prince andrew  and what do you 
think of kutuzov appointment he asked   was very 
glad of his appointment that all i know replied prince 
andrew   tell me your opinion of de in 
moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him what 
do you think of him   them replied prince 
andrew indicating the officers  pierre looked at with the 
smile with which everybody addressed that officer   see 
light again since his has been appointed your excellency said 
timidly and continually turning to glance at his colonel  
 so asked pierre   to mention only and 
let me inform you why when we were from we 
not touch a stick or a of or anything you 
see we were going away so he would get it 
all it so your excellency and again turned to the 
prince  we in our regiment two officers were court 
for that kind of thing but when his took command 
everything became straight forward now we see light   
why was it  looked about in not knowing what 
or how to answer such a question pierre put the 
same question to prince andrew   so as not 
to lay the country we were to the said prince 
andrew with irony  is very sound one can the 
land to be and the to at too he that 
the french might us as they had larger forces but 
he could not understand this cried prince andrew in a 
voice that seemed to escape him  could not understand 
that there for the first time we were for russian 
soil and that there was a spirit in the men 
such as i had never seen before that we had 
held the french for two days and that that success 
had our strength he ordered us to and all our 
and went for nothing he had no thought of betraying 
us he tried to do the best he could he 
thought out everything and that is why he is he 
is now just because he out everything very thoroughly and 
as every german has to how can i explain well 
say your father has a german and he is a 
splendid and your father better than you could then it 
all right to let him serve but if your father 
is you send the away and attend to your father 
with your own awkward hands and will soothe him better 
than a man who is a stranger could so it 
has been with while russia was well a could serve 
her and be a splendid but as soon as she 
is in danger she one of her own but in 
your club they have been making him out a traitor 
they him as a traitor and the only result will 
be that afterwards ashamed of their they will make him 
out a hero or a instead of a traitor and 
that will be still more he is an and very 
german   they say he a commander rejoined pierre 
  don understand what is meant by  commander 
replied prince andrew ironically   commander replied pierre  
one who all and the intentions   that impossible 
said prince andrew as if it were a matter settled 
long ago  pierre looked at him in surprise  
 yet they say that war is like a game 
of he remarked   replied prince andrew  with 
this little difference that in you may think over each 
move as long as you please and are not for 
time and with this difference too that a is always 
than a and two are always than one while in 
war a is sometimes than a and sometimes than a 
company the strength of of can never be known to 
anyone believe me he went on  things on made 
by the staff i should be there making but instead 
of that i have the honor to serve here in 
the regiment with these gentlemen and i consider that on 
us tomorrow battle will and not on those others success 
never depends and never will on position or equipment or 
even on and least of all on position   
on what then   the feeling that is in 
me and in him he pointed to  in each 
 prince andrew glanced at who looked at his commander 
in alarm and in contrast to his former prince andrew 
now seemed he could apparently not refrain from expressing the 
thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him   battle 
is won by those who firmly to it why did 
we lose the battle at the french were almost equal 
to ours but very early we said to ourselves that 
we were losing the battle and we did lose it 
and we said so because we had nothing to fight 
for there we wanted to get away from the as 
soon as we could  lost so let us run 
and we ran if we had not said that till 
the evening heaven knows what might not have happened but 
tomorrow we say it you talk about our position the 
left weak and the right too he went on  
all nonsense there nothing of the kind but what us 
tomorrow a hundred million most which will be decided on 
the instant by the fact that our men or run 
or do not run and that this man or that 
man is killed but all that is being done at 
present is only play the fact is that those men 
with whom you have round the position not only do 
not help matters but they are only concerned with their 
own interests   such a moment said pierre  
 such a moment prince andrew repeated  them it 
is only a moment to a rival and obtain an 
cross or ribbon for me tomorrow means this a russian 
army of a hundred thousand and a french army of 
a hundred thousand have met to fight and the thing 
is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and 
the side that more and itself least will and if 
you like i will tell you that happens and those 
at the top may make we shall tomorrow battle tomorrow 
happen what may we shall   now your excellency 
that the truth the real truth said  would spare 
himself now the soldiers in my believe me drink their 
 not the day for that they say  all 
were silent the officers rose prince andrew went out of 
the with them giving final orders to the adjutant after 
they had gone pierre approached prince andrew and was about 
to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of 
three horses on the road not far from the and 
looking in that direction prince andrew recognized and accompanied by 
a cossack they close by continuing to converse and prince 
andrew heard these words   in  said one 
of them         
 war must be widely i cannot    
  that    said the other  
so man in        
   yes the only aim is to the 
so of      course one cannot 
take into account the of private     
    no agreed the other   
widely said prince andrew with an angry when they had 
past  that  were my father son and sister 
at bald hills that all the same to him that 
what i was saying to you german gentlemen won the 
battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they 
can because they have nothing in their german heads but 
not worth an empty and haven in their hearts the 
one thing tomorrow which has they have up all europe 
to him and have now come to us fine and 
again his voice grew   you think we shall 
tomorrow battle asked pierre   yes answered prince andrew 
 thing i would do if i had the power 
he began again  would not take prisoners why take 
prisoners it the french have destroyed my home and are 
on their way to moscow they have and are me 
every moment they are my in my opinion they are 
all and so thinks and the whole army they should 
be since they are my they cannot be my friends 
may have been said at   yes muttered pierre 
looking with shining eyes at prince andrew  quite agree 
with you  the question that had pierre on the 
hill and all that day now seemed to him quite 
clear and completely solved he now understood the whole meaning 
and importance of this war and of the battle all 
he had seen that day all the significant and stern 
expressions on the faces he had seen in passing were 
lit up for him by a new light he understood 
that heat  they say in of which was present 
in all these men he had seen and this explained 
to him why they all prepared for death and as 
it were   take prisoners prince andrew continued  
by itself would quite change the whole war and make 
it less cruel as it is we have played at 
war what we play at magnanimity and all that such 
magnanimity and are like the magnanimity and of a lady 
who when she a being killed she is so kindhearted 
that she can look at blood but enjoys the served 
up with they talk to us of the of war 
of of of truce of mercy to the unfortunate and 
so on it all i saw and of truce in 
 they us and we them they other people paper 
money and of all they kill my children and my 
father and then talk of of war and magnanimity to 
take no prisoners but kill and be killed he who 
has come to this as i have through the same 
sufferings  prince andrew who had thought it was all 
the same to him whether or not moscow was taken 
as had been was suddenly checked in his speech by 
an in his he up and down a few times 
in silence but his eyes and his lips quivered as 
he began speaking   there was none of this 
magnanimity in war we should go to war only when 
it was worth while going to certain death as now 
then there would not be war because had offended michael 
and when there was a war like this one it 
would be war and then the of the would be 
quite different then all these and whom napoleon is leading 
would not follow him into russia and we should not 
go to fight in austria and prussia without knowing why 
war is not but the most horrible thing in life 
and we ought to understand that and not play at 
war we ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and 
seriously it all lies in that get rid of and 
let war be war and not a game as it 
is now war is the favorite of the and the 
military calling is the most highly   what is 
war what is for success in what are the of 
the military the aim of war is murder the of 
war are and their the of a country them or 
to the army and and military the of the military 
class are the of freedom that is debauchery and and 
in spite of all this it is the highest class 
respected by everyone all the except the wear military and 
he who most people the highest   meet as 
we shall meet tomorrow to murder one another they kill 
and tens of thousands and then have for having killed 
so many people  even the number and they announce 
a that the more people they have killed the greater 
their how does god above look at them and hear 
them exclaimed prince andrew in a piercing voice  my 
friend it has of late become hard for me to 
live i see that i have to understand too much 
and it doesn do for man to taste of the 
tree of knowledge of good and ah well it not 
for long he added   you sleepy and it 
time for me to sleep go back to said prince 
andrew suddenly   no pierre replied looking at prince 
andrew with frightened eyes   go before a battle 
one must have one sleep out repeated prince andrew  
he came quickly up to pierre and embraced and kissed 
him  be off he shouted  we meet again 
or not and turning away hurriedly he entered the  
it was already dark and pierre could not make out 
whether the expression of prince andrew face was angry or 
tender  for some time he stood in silence considering 
whether he should follow him or go away  he 
does not want it pierre concluded  i know that 
this is our last meeting he deeply and back to 
 on the prince andrew lay down on a but 
he could not sleep  he closed his eyes one 
picture succeeded another in his on one of them he 
dwelt long and joyfully he recalled an evening in petersburg 
natasha with animated and face was telling him how she 
had gone to look for the previous summer and had 
lost her way in the big forest she described the 
of the forest her and a talk with a she 
met and constantly interrupted her story to say  i 
can i not telling it right no you don understand 
though he her by saying that he did understand and 
he really had understood all she wanted to say but 
natasha was not satisfied with her own words she felt 
that they did not the passionately feeling she had experienced 
that day and wished to  was such a delightful 
old man and it was so dark in the forest 
and he had such kind no i can describe it 
she had said flushed and prince andrew smiled now the 
same happy smile as then when he had looked into 
her eyes  understood her he thought  not only 
understood her but it was just that inner force that 
that of soul very soul of hers which seemed to 
be by her body was that soul i loved in 
her loved so strongly and and suddenly he remembered how 
his love had ended  did not need anything of 
that kind he neither saw nor understood anything of the 
sort he only saw in her a pretty and fresh 
young girl with whom he did not to his fate 
and i and he is still and gay  prince 
andrew jumped up as if someone had him and again 
began pacing up and down in front of the  
    chapter   on august  
the of the battle of de of the french emperor 
arrived at napoleon at with colonel the former from paris 
and the latter from  his court uniform de ordered 
a box he had brought for the emperor to be 
carried before him and entered the first of napoleon where 
he began opening the box while conversing with napoleon who 
him  not entering the remained at the entrance talking 
to some of his acquaintance  the emperor napoleon had 
not yet left his and was finishing his slightly and 
he now his back and now his plump chest to 
the with which his was rubbing him down another with 
his finger over the mouth of a bottle was de 
on the emperor body with an expression which seemed to 
say that he alone knew where and how much de 
should be napoleon short hair was and on the forehead 
but his face though and expressed satisfaction  on go 
on he muttered to the who was rubbing him slightly 
and an aide who had entered the to report to 
the emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterday was 
standing by the door after his awaiting to napoleon frowning 
looked at him from under his brows   prisoners 
said he repeating the aide words  are us to 
them so much the worse for the russian army go 
on he muttered his back and presenting his fat shoulders 
  right let monsieur de enter and too he 
said nodding to the aide   and the aide 
through the door of the  two rapidly dressed his 
majesty and wearing the blue uniform of the guards he 
went with firm quick steps to the reception room  
de hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he 
had brought from the empress on two chairs in front 
of the entrance but napoleon had dressed and come out 
with such that he had not time to finish arranging 
the surprise  napoleon noticed at once what they were 
about and guessed that they were not ready he did 
not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving 
him a surprise so he pretended not to see de 
and called to him listening silently and with a stern 
frown to what told him of the and devotion of 
his at at the other end of europe with but 
one thought be worthy of their emperor but one fear 
to please him the result of that battle had been 
napoleon made remarks during account as if he had not 
expected that matters could go in his   must 
make up for that in moscow said napoleon  see 
you later he added and de who by that time 
had prepared the surprise having placed something on the chairs 
and covered it with a  de bowed low with 
that french bow which only the old of the bourbons 
knew how to make and approached him presenting an  
napoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his   
have hurried here i am very glad well what is 
paris saying he asked suddenly changing his former stern expression 
for a most tone   all paris your replied 
de as was proper  but though napoleon knew that 
de had to say something of this kind and though 
in his moments he knew it was he was pleased 
to hear it from him again he him by touching 
his   am very sorry to have made you 
travel so far said he   i expected nothing 
less than to find you at the of moscow replied 
de  napoleon smiled and lifting his head absent glanced 
to the right an aide approached with steps and offered 
him a gold snuffbox which he took   it 
has happened for you he said raising the open snuffbox 
to his nose  are fond of travel and in 
three days you will see moscow you did not expect 
to see that capital you will have a pleasant  
de bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for 
travel  which he had not till then been aware 
  what this asked napoleon noticing that all the 
were looking at something under a  with de half 
turned and without turning his back to the emperor two 
steps off the at the same time and said  
 present to your majesty from the empress  it 
was a portrait in bright colors by of the son 
to napoleon by the daughter of the emperor of austria 
the boy whom for some reason everyone called  king 
of  a very pretty curly boy with a look 
of the in the was playing at stick and ball 
the ball the and the stick in his other hand 
a  though it was not clear what the meant 
to express by the so king of the earth with 
a stick the apparently seemed to napoleon as it had 
done to all who had seen it in paris quite 
clear and very   king of he said pointing 
to the portrait with a graceful gesture   with 
the natural capacity of an italian for changing the expression 
of his face at will he drew nearer to the 
portrait and assumed a look of tenderness he felt that 
what he now said and did would be and it 
seemed to him that it would now be best for 
him his son to play stick and ball with the 
show in contrast to that the simplest tenderness his eyes 
grew he moved forward glanced round at a chair  
seemed to place itself under him and sat down on 
it before the portrait at a single gesture from him 
everyone went out on leaving the great man to himself 
and his  having sat still for a while he 
touched not knowing why thick spot of paint the highest 
light in the portrait rose and recalled de and the 
officer on duty he ordered the portrait to be carried 
outside his that the old round it might not be 
of the pleasure of seeing the king of the son 
and heir of their adored monarch  and while he 
was doing de the honor of with him they heard 
as napoleon had the rapturous of the officers and men 
of the old who had run up to see the 
portrait   l le de l came those ecstatic 
 after napoleon in de presence his order of the 
day to the army   and he remarked when 
he had read over the which he had straight off 
without it ran   soldiers this is the battle 
you have so for depends on you it is essential 
for us it will give us all we need comfortable 
and a return to our country behave as you did 
at and let our your this day with pride let 
it be said of each of you  was in 
the great battle before moscow    moscow repeated 
napoleon and inviting de who was so fond of travel 
to him on his ride he went out of the 
to where the horses stood   majesty is too 
kind replied de to the invitation to the emperor he 
wanted to sleep did not know how to ride and 
was afraid of doing so  but napoleon nodded to 
the and de had to when napoleon came out of 
the the shouting of the guards before his son portrait 
grew still louder napoleon frowned   him away he 
said pointing with a gracefully gesture to the portrait  
is too soon for him to see a field of 
battle  de closed his eyes bowed his head and 
deeply to indicate how he and the emperor words  
    chapter   on the twenty 
of august so his tell us napoleon spent the whole 
day on the considering to him by his and personally 
giving commands to his  the line of the russian 
forces along the river had been by the of the 
on the twenty and part of the line left been 
drawn back that part of the line was not and 
in front of it the ground was more open and 
than it was evident to anyone military or not that 
it was here the french should attack it would seem 
that not much consideration was to reach this nor any 
particular care or trouble on the part of the emperor 
and his nor was there any need of that special 
and called that people are so to to napoleon yet 
the who described the later and the men who then 
napoleon and he himself thought  napoleon over the plain 
and the with a profound air and in silence nodded 
with approval or shook his head and without to the 
around him the profound course of ideas which his decisions 
merely gave them his final in the form of commands 
having listened to a from who was now called prince 
d to turn the russian left napoleon said it should 
not be done without explaining why not to a made 
by general  was to attack the to lead his 
through the napoleon agreed though the so of  to 
remark that a movement through the was dangerous and might 
the  having the country opposite the napoleon pondered a 
little in silence and then indicated the where two should 
be set up by the to act against the russian 
and the places where in line with them the field 
should be placed  after giving these and other commands 
he returned to his and the for the battle were 
written down from his  these of which the french 
write with enthusiasm and other with profound respect were as 
follows   at dawn the two new during the 
night on the plain occupied by the prince d will 
open fire on the of the  at the same 
time the commander of the of the  corps general 
with thirty of and all the of and will move 
forward open fire and with the against which will  
         of 
the of the guards       
   of   and    
  of and       
     in all    
the commander of the of the  corps general will 
place the of the  and  corps sixteen in 
all on the of the that is to the on 
the left which will have forty in all against it 
 general must be ready at the first order to 
with all the of the against either one or other 
of the  during the prince is to through the 
wood on the village and turn the position  general 
will move through the wood to seize the first  
after the has in this manner orders will be given 
in with the movements  the on the left will 
begin as soon as the of the right are heard 
the of and of the will open a heavy fire 
on seeing the attack on the right  the will 
the village and cross by its three to the same 
as and which under his will be against the and 
come into line with the rest of the forces  
all this must be done in good order  as 
far as possible in reserve  the imperial near  
     these which are very and 
confused if one to regard the without of his related 
to napoleon orders to deal with four different orders not 
one of these was or could be carried out  
in the disposition it is said first that the placed 
on the spot by napoleon with the of and which 
were to come in line with them  in all 
were to open fire and on the russian and this 
could not be done as from the by napoleon the 
did not carry to the russian and those  into 
the air until the commander contrary to napoleon moved them 
forward  the second order was that moving to the 
village through the wood should turn the russian left this 
could not be done and was not done because on 
the village through the wood met there his way and 
could not and did not turn the russian position  
the third order was general will move through the wood 
to seize the first general did not seize the first 
but was driven back for on from the wood it 
had to reform under of which napoleon was unaware  
the fourth order was the will the village  and 
cross by its three to the same as and  
whose movements no directions are given which under his will 
be against the and come into line with the rest 
of the forces  as far as one can make 
out not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from 
the the made to the orders given him he was 
to from the left through to the while the of 
and were to from the front  all this like 
the other of the disposition was not and could not 
be after passing through the was driven back to the 
and could get no farther while the of and did 
not take the but were driven back and the was 
only taken at the end of the battle by the 
cavalry  thing probably and not heard of by napoleon 
so not one of the orders in the disposition was 
or could be but in the disposition it is said 
that after the fight has in this manner orders will 
be given in with the movements and so it might 
be that all necessary would be made by napoleon during 
the battle but this was not and could not be 
done for during the whole battle napoleon was so far 
away that as appeared later he could not know the 
course of the battle and not one of his orders 
during the fight could be      
chapter   many say that the french did not 
the battle of because napoleon had a cold and that 
if he had not had a cold the orders he 
gave before and during the battle would have been still 
more full of and russia would have been lost and 
the face of the world have been changed to who 
believe that russia was by the will of one man 
the great that france from a became an empire and 
french went to russia at the will of one man 
say that russia remained a power because napoleon had a 
bad cold on the twenty of august may seem and 
 if it had on napoleon will to fight or 
not to fight the battle of and if this or 
that other on his will then evidently a cold the 
of his will might have russia and the who to 
bring napoleon his on the twenty would have been the 
of russia along that line of thought such a is 
as as the made in  knowing what he was 
at when he saw that the of st was to 
ix being but to men who do not admit that 
russia was formed by the will of one man peter 
i or that the french empire was formed and the 
war with russia by the will of one man napoleon 
that seems not merely and but contrary to all human 
to the question of what causes another answer itself that 
the course of human is from on high on the 
of the of all who take part in the and 
that a napoleon influence on the course of these is 
and  strange as at first glance it may seem 
to suppose that the of st was not to ix 
will though he gave the order for it and thought 
it was done as a result of that order and 
strange as it may seem to suppose that the of 
eighty thousand men at was not to napoleon will though 
he ordered the and conduct of the battle and thought 
it was done because he ordered it strange as these 
appear yet human dignity tells me that each of us 
is if not more at least not less a man 
than the great napoleon the of that of the question 
and it  at the battle of napoleon at no 
one and killed no one that was all done by 
the soldiers therefore it was not he who killed people 
 the french soldiers went to kill and be killed 
at the battle of not because of napoleon orders but 
by their own the whole army italian german and and 
weary of the felt at the sight of an army 
blocking their road to moscow that the wine was drawn 
and must be drunk had napoleon then them to fight 
the russians they would have killed him and have to 
fight the russians because it was  when they heard 
napoleon them as for and death the words of about 
their having been in the battle before moscow they cried 
 l just as they had cried  l at 
the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the 
with a stick and just as they would have cried 
 l at any nonsense that might be told them 
there was nothing left for them to do but cry 
 l and go to fight in order to get 
food and rest as in moscow so it was not 
because of napoleon commands that they killed their fellow men 
 and it was not napoleon who the course of 
the battle for none of his orders were and during 
the battle he did not know what was going on 
before him so the way in which these people killed 
one another was not decided by napoleon will but occurred 
of him in accord with the will of of thousands 
of people who took part in the common it only 
seemed to napoleon that it all took place by his 
will and so the question whether he had or had 
not a cold has no more interest than the cold 
of the least of the soldiers  moreover the made 
by that his cold was the cause of his not 
being as well as on former and of his orders 
during the battle not being as good as is quite 
which again shows that napoleon cold on the twenty of 
august was  the above are not at all worse 
but are even better than previous by which he had 
won his during the battle were also no worse than 
but much the same as usual these and orders only 
seem worse than previous ones because the battle of was 
the first napoleon did not the and most excellent and 
orders seem very bad and every learned them with looks 
of importance when they to a battle that has been 
lost and the very and orders seem very good and 
serious people whole to their when they to a battle 
that has been won  the drawn up by for 
the battle of were a model of perfection for that 
kind of but still they were for their very perfection 
for their  napoleon at the battle of his as 
of as well as and even better than at other 
he did nothing to the progress of the battle he 
inclined to the most opinions he made no did not 
himself did not get frightened or run away from the 
field of battle but with his great tact and military 
experience carried out his role of to command and with 
dignity      chapter   on 
returning from a second inspection of the lines napoleon remarked 
  are set up the game will begin tomorrow 
 having ordered and de he began to talk to 
him about paris and about some he meant to make 
in the empress household surprising the by his memory of 
minute to the court  he showed an interest in 
trifles about de love of travel and as a famous 
self who knows his job does when turning up his 
sleeves and putting on his while a patient is being 
to the table  matter is in my hands and 
is clear and definite in my head when the time 
comes to set to work i shall do it as 
no one else could but now i can and the 
more i and the calmer i am the more and 
confident you ought to be and the more at my 
 having finished his second glass of napoleon went to 
rest before the serious business which he considered him next 
day he was so much interested in that task that 
he was unable to sleep and in spite of his 
cold which had grown worse from the of the evening 
he went into the large of the at three o 
in the morning loudly his nose he asked whether the 
russians had not and was told that the were still 
in the same places he nodded approval  the adjutant 
in came into the   do you think we 
shall do good business today napoleon asked him   
doubt replied  napoleon looked at him   you 
remember what you did me the honor to say at 
continued  wine is drawn and must be drunk  
napoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time his 
head on his hand   poor army he suddenly 
remarked  has greatly since fortune is a i have 
always said so and i am beginning to experience it 
but the guards the guards are he remarked   
replied  napoleon took a put it in his mouth 
and glanced at his watch he was not sleepy and 
it was still not nearly morning it was impossible to 
give further orders for the sake of time for the 
orders had all been given and were now being  
 the and been served out to the of the 
guards asked napoleon sternly     too  
replied that he had given the emperor order about the 
but napoleon shook his head in as if not that 
his order had been an came in with napoleon ordered 
another glass to be brought for and silently his own 
  have neither taste nor smell he remarked at 
his glass  cold is tiresome they talk about is 
the good of when it can a cold gave me 
these but they don help at all what can doctors 
one can anything our body is a machine for living 
it is for that it is its nature let life 
go on in it and let it defend itself it 
will do more than if you it by it with 
our body is like a watch that should go for 
a certain time the cannot open it he can only 
it by and that yes our body is just a 
machine for living that is all  and having entered 
on the path of of which he was fond napoleon 
suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one   you 
know what military art is asked he  is the 
art of being than the at a given moment that 
all  made no reply   we shall have 
to deal with kutuzov said napoleon  shall see do 
you remember at he an army for three and did 
not once a horse to his we shall see  
he looked at his watch it was still only four 
o he did not feel sleepy the was finished and 
there was still nothing to do he rose walked to 
and fro put on a warm and a hat and 
went out of the the night was dark and a 
scarcely perceptible was from above near by the were burning 
among the french guards and in the distance those of 
the russian line shone through the smoke the weather was 
calm and the rustle and of the french already beginning 
to move to take up their positions were clearly audible 
 napoleon walked about in front of his looked at 
the and listened to these sounds and as he was 
passing a tall guardsman in a cap who was standing 
before his and had drawn himself up like a black 
at sight of the emperor napoleon stopped in front of 
him   year did you enter the service he 
asked with that affectation of military and with which he 
always addressed the soldiers  the man answered the question 
  one of the old ones has your regiment 
had its   has your majesty  napoleon nodded 
and walked away   at half five napoleon to 
the village of  it was growing light the sky 
was only a single cloud lay in the east the 
were burning themselves out in the faint morning light  
on the right a single deep report of a and 
died away in the silence some minutes passed a second 
and a third report shook the air then a fourth 
and a solemnly near by on the right  the 
first had not yet ceased to before others rang out 
and yet more were heard mingling with and one another 
 napoleon with his up to the where he the 
game had      chapter   
on returning to after having seen prince andrew pierre ordered 
his to get the horses ready and to call him 
early in the morning and then immediately fell behind a 
in a corner boris had given up to him  
before he was thoroughly next morning everybody had already left 
the the were in the little and his was shaking 
him   excellency your excellency your excellency he kept 
repeating while he shook pierre by the shoulder without looking 
at him having apparently lost hope of getting him to 
up   has it is it time pierre asked 
waking up   the said the a  the 
gentlemen have gone out and his serene himself past long 
ago  pierre dressed hastily and ran out to the 
porch outside all was bright fresh and cheerful the sun 
just from behind a cloud that had it was shining 
with still half broken by the over the of the 
street opposite on the dust of the road on the 
of the on the the and on pierre horses standing 
before the the of sounded more distinct outside an adjutant 
accompanied by a cossack passed by at a sharp  
 time count it time cried the adjutant  telling 
the to follow him with the horses pierre went down 
the street to the from which he had looked at 
the field of battle the day before a crowd of 
military men was assembled there members of the staff could 
be heard conversing in french and kutuzov gray head in 
a white cap with a red band was visible his 
gray between his shoulders he was looking through a field 
glass down the before him  the steps to the 
pierre looked at the scene before him by beauty it 
was the same he had from that spot the day 
before but now the whole place was full of and 
covered by smoke from the and the of the bright 
sun rising slightly to the left behind pierre upon it 
through the clear morning air of rosy light and long 
dark the forest at the of the seemed in some 
precious stone of a color its was against the and 
was by the crowded with nearer at hand with there 
were to be seen everywhere in front and to the 
right and left all this was and but what pierre 
most of all was the of the itself of and 
the on both sides of the  above the in 
and on both sides of it especially to the left 
where the between its into the a had spread which 
seemed to to and to become when the brilliant sun 
appeared and and everything the smoke of the mingled with 
this and over the whole and through that the of 
the morning sun were reflected back like from the water 
from the and from the of the crowded together by 
the and in a white could be seen through the 
and here and there the of in as well as 
of soldiers or green and and all this moved or 
seemed to move as the smoke and spread out over 
the whole space just as in the hollow near so 
along the line outside and above it and especially in 
the and to the left in the and on the 
of the high ground of smoke seemed continually to spring 
up out of nothing now singly now several at a 
time some others which growing rolling and over the whole 
 these of smoke and  to say the sound 
of the produced the chief beauty of the   
a round cloud of smoke was seen merging from into 
gray and white and  came the report a second 
later   two pushing one another and together and 
 came the sounds what the eye had seen  
pierre glanced round at the first cloud which he had 
seen as a round ball and in its place already 
were of smoke to one side and  a pause 
three and then four more appeared and then from each 
with the same came the fine firm sounds in reply 
it seemed as if those smoke sometimes ran and sometimes 
stood still while and ran past them from the left 
over and those large balls of smoke were continually followed 
by their solemn reports while nearer still in the and 
there burst from the small that had no time to 
become balls but had their little in just the same 
way  came the of but it was and in 
with the reports of the  pierre wished to be 
there with that smoke those shining that movement and those 
sounds he turned to look at kutuzov and his to 
compare his with those of others they were all looking 
at the field of battle as he was and as 
it seemed to him with the same all their faces 
were now shining with that of feeling pierre had noticed 
the day before and had fully understood after his talk 
with prince andrew   my dear fellow go and 
be with you kutuzov was saying to a general who 
stood beside him not taking his eye from the  
having received this order the general passed by pierre on 
his way down the   the crossing said the 
general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the 
staff who asked where he was going   go 
there too i too thought pierre and followed the general 
 the general a horse a cossack had brought him 
pierre went to his who was holding his horses and 
asking which was the onto it seized it by the 
and turning out his pressed his heels against its sides 
and feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable 
to let go of the and he after the general 
causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him 
from the      chapter   
having the hill the general after whom pierre was turned 
to the left and pierre losing sight of him in 
among some ranks of infantry of him he tried to 
pass either in front of them or to the right 
or left but there were soldiers everywhere all with the 
same expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important 
task they all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring 
expression at this stout man in a white hat who 
for some reason to them under his horse   
ride into the middle of the one of them shouted 
at him  another his horse with the end of 
a and pierre bending over his and hardly able to 
control his horse of the soldiers where there was a 
free space  there was a bridge of him where 
other soldiers stood pierre up to them without being aware 
of it he had come to the bridge across the 
between and which the french  occupied were in the 
first of the battle pierre saw that there was a 
bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing 
something on both sides of it and in the among 
the rows of new which he had taken no notice 
of amid the smoke of the the day before but 
despite the going on there he had no idea that 
this was the field of battle he did not notice 
the sound of the from every side or the that 
over him did not see the on the other side 
of the river and for a long time did not 
notice the killed and though many fell near him he 
looked about him with a smile which did not leave 
his face   that fellow in front of the 
line shouted somebody at him again   the left 
keep to the right the men shouted to him  
pierre went to the right and unexpectedly one of adjutants 
whom he knew the adjutant looked angrily at him evidently 
also intending to at him but on him he nodded 
  have you got here he said and on 
 pierre feeling out of place there having nothing to 
do and afraid of getting in someone way again after 
the adjutant   here may i come with you 
he asked   moment one moment replied the adjutant 
and up to a stout colonel who was standing in 
the he gave him some and then addressed pierre  
 have you come here count he asked with a 
smile    yes pierre  but the adjutant 
turned his horse about and on   it said 
he  with on the left they getting it hot 
  said pierre  is that   along 
with me to our we can get a from there 
and in our it is still said the adjutant  
you come   i come with you replied pierre 
looking round for his  it was only now that 
he noticed men along or being carried on on that 
very he had over the day before a was lying 
the rows of scented with his head thrown awkwardly back 
and his off   haven they carried him away 
pierre was about to ask but seeing the stern expression 
of the adjutant who was also looking that way he 
checked himself  pierre did not find his and along 
the hollow with the adjutant to his horse behind the 
adjutant and him at every step   don seem 
to be used to count remarked the adjutant   
it not that but her seems so said pierre in 
a tone   she said the adjutant  the 
off above the knee a no doubt i congratulate you 
count on your of fire  having in the smoke 
past the corps behind the which had been moved forward 
and was in them with the noise of they came 
to a small wood there it was cool and quiet 
with a of pierre and the adjutant and walked up 
the hill on foot   the general here asked 
the adjutant on reaching the   was here a 
minute ago but has just gone that way someone told 
him pointing to the right  the adjutant looked at 
pierre as if what to do with him now  
 trouble about me said pierre  go up onto 
the if i may   do you see everything 
from there and it less dangerous and i come for 
you  pierre went to the and the adjutant on 
they did not meet again and only much later did 
pierre learn that he lost an arm that day  
the to which pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards 
known to the russians as the or and to the 
french as la la la around which tens of thousands 
fell and which the french regarded as the key to 
the whole position  this of a on three sides 
of which had been within the stood ten that were 
being through in the  in line with the on 
both sides stood other which also a little behind the 
stood infantry when that pierre had no that this spot 
on which small had been and from which a few 
were was the most important point of the battle  
on the contrary just because he happened to be there 
he thought it one of the least significant of the 
field  having reached the pierre sat down at one 
end of a the and gazed at what was going 
on around him with an happy smile occasionally he rose 
and walked about the still with that same smile trying 
not to the soldiers who were the and continually running 
past him with and the of that were being continually 
one after another with a the whole neighborhood in smoke 
 in contrast with the felt by the placed in 
support here in the where a small number of men 
busy at their work were from the rest by a 
everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling 
of animation  the of pierre figure in a white 
hat made an unpleasant at first the soldiers looked askance 
at him with surprise and even alarm as they went 
past him the senior officer a tall long man moved 
over to pierre as if to see the of the 
and looked at him with curiosity  a young round 
officer quite a boy still and evidently only just out 
of the cadet who was the two to him addressed 
pierre sternly   he said  me to ask 
you to stand aside you must not be here  
the soldiers shook their heads as they looked at pierre 
but when they had convinced themselves that this man in 
the white hat was doing no but either sat quietly 
on the of the with a shy smile or politely 
making way for the soldiers up and down the under 
fire as as if he were on a their feeling 
of gradually began to change into a kindly and sympathy 
such as soldiers feel for their dogs and in general 
for the that live with the regiment the men soon 
pierre into their family adopted him gave him a nickname 
 and made kindly fun of him among themselves  
a up the earth two from pierre and he looked 
around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes 
some earth it had thrown up   how it 
you not afraid sir really now a red broad asked 
pierre with a that a set of sound white teeth 
  you afraid then said pierre   else 
do you expect answered the  has no mercy you 
know when she comes down out go your one can 
help being afraid he said laughing  several of the 
men with bright kindly faces stopped beside pierre they seemed 
not to have expected him to talk like anybody else 
and the that he did so delighted them   
the business of us soldiers but in a it wonderful 
there a for you   your places cried the 
young officer to the men gathered round pierre  the 
young officer was evidently his duties for the first or 
second time and therefore treated both his and the men 
with great precision and  the and the of were 
growing more over the whole field especially to the left 
where were but where pierre was the smoke of the 
made it almost impossible to distinguish anything moreover his whole 
attention was by watching the family circle from all else 
by the men in the his first feeling of joyful 
animation produced by the and sounds of the was now 
replaced by another especially since he had seen that lying 
alone in the now seated on the of the he 
observed the faces of those around him  by ten 
o some twenty men had already been carried away from 
the two were smashed and balls fell more and more 
frequently on the and spent and around but the men 
in the seemed not to notice this and merry voices 
and were heard on all sides   live one 
shouted a man as a approached   this way 
to the infantry added another with loud laughter seeing the 
fly past and fall into the ranks of the  
 you to a friend eh remarked another a who 
low as a ball over  several soldiers gathered by 
the wall of the looking out to see what was 
in front   the front line it has said 
they pointing over the   your own business an 
old shouted at them  they it because there work 
for them to do farther back  and the taking 
one of the men by the shoulders gave him a 
with his knee this was followed by a burst of 
laughter   the it up came shouts from one 
side   then all together like rose the merry 
voices of those who were moving the   she 
nearly our hat off cried the red showing his teeth 
pierre  he added to a ball that struck a 
and a man   then you said another laughing 
at some who low entered the to carry away the 
man   this isn to your taste oh you 
you scared they shouted at the who stood before the 
man whose had been off   oh oh they 
the  don like it at all  pierre noticed 
that after every ball that hit the and after every 
the more and more  as the of the fire 
within come more and more and rapidly from an approaching 
so as if in to what was taking place the 
of fire growing more and more in the faces of 
these men  pierre did not look out at the 
and was not concerned to know what was there he 
was entirely in watching this fire which ever more and 
which he felt was flaming up in the same way 
in his own soul  at ten o the infantry 
that had been among the in front of the and 
along the from the they could be seen running back 
past it carrying their on their a general with his 
came to the and after speaking to the colonel gave 
pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered 
the infantry behind the to lie down so as to 
be less exposed to fire after this from amid the 
ranks of infantry to the right of the came the 
sound of a and shouts of command and from the 
one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward  
pierre looked over the wall of the and was particularly 
struck by a pale young officer who letting his sword 
down was and kept glancing uneasily around  the ranks 
of the infantry amid the smoke but their long and 
could still be heard a few minutes later of men 
and came back from that direction began to fall still 
more frequently in the several men were lying about who 
had not been removed around the the men moved still 
more briskly and busily no one any longer took notice 
of pierre once or twice he was shouted at for 
being in the way the senior officer moved with big 
from one to another with a frowning face the young 
officer with his face still more flushed the men more 
than ever the soldiers up the turned and did their 
business with strained smartness they gave little as they walked 
as though they were on  the had come upon 
them and in every face the fire which pierre had 
watched up pierre standing beside the officer the young officer 
his hand to his ran up to his superior  
 have the honor to report sir that only eight 
are left are we to continue he asked   
the senior shouted without answering the question looking over the 
wall of the  suddenly something happened the young officer 
gave a and bending sat down on the ground like 
a on the everything became strange confused and in pierre 
eyes  one ball after another by and struck the 
a or a pierre who had not noticed these sounds 
before now heard nothing else on the right of the 
soldiers shouting  were running not but it seemed to 
pierre  a ball struck the very end of the 
earth work by which he was standing down the earth 
a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the 
same instant into something some who were entering the ran 
back   with shouted the officer  the ran 
up to the officer and in a frightened whisper him 
 a butler at dinner his that there is no 
more of some wine asked for that there were no 
more   what are they doing shouted the officer 
turning to pierre  the officer face was red and 
and his eyes under his frowning   to the 
and bring up the he angrily pierre with his eyes 
and speaking to his men   go said pierre 
 the officer without answering him strode across to the 
opposite side   fire wait he shouted  the 
man who had been ordered to go for against pierre 
  sir this is no place for you said 
he and ran down the  pierre ran after him 
the spot where the young officer was sitting  one 
ball another and a third over him falling in front 
beside and behind him pierre ran down the  am 
i going he suddenly asked himself when he was already 
near the green he not knowing whether to return or 
go on suddenly a terrible threw him to the ground 
at the same instant he was by a great of 
and immediately a and made his ears  when he 
came to himself he was sitting on the ground on 
his hands the he had been approaching no longer only 
green and the grass and a horse of its behind 
it past while another horse lay like pierre on the 
ground uttering and piercing      chapter 
  beside himself with pierre jumped up and ran 
back to the as to the only from the horrors 
that him  on entering the he noticed that there 
were men doing something there but that no were being 
from the he had no time to who these men 
were he saw the senior officer lying on the earth 
wall with his back turned as if he were something 
down below and that one of the soldiers he had 
noticed before was forward shouting  and trying to free 
himself from some men who were holding him by the 
arm he also saw something else that was strange  
but he had not time to that the colonel had 
been killed that the shouting  was a and that 
another man had been in the back before his eyes 
for hardly had he run into the before a thin 
sallow man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword 
in hand shouting something against the they had been running 
together at full speed before they saw one another put 
out his hands and seized the man  french officer 
by the shoulder with one hand and by the with 
the other the officer dropping his sword seized pierre by 
his collar  for some they gazed with frightened eyes 
at one another faces and both were perplexed at what 
they had done and what they were to do next 
 i taken or have i taken him each was 
thinking but the french officer was evidently more inclined to 
think he had been taken because pierre strong hand by 
fear his ever and the frenchman was about to say 
something when just above their heads terrible and low a 
ball and it seemed to pierre that the french officer 
head had been off so swiftly had he it  
pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall 
without further thought as to who had taken whom the 
frenchman ran back to the and pierre ran down the 
stumbling over the dead and who it seemed to him 
caught at his feet but before he reached the foot 
of the he was met by a crowd of russian 
soldiers who stumbling tripping up and shouting ran merrily and 
toward the  was the attack for which the that 
only his courage and good luck made such a possible 
it was the attack in which he was said to 
have thrown some st george he had in his into 
the for the first soldiers to take who got there 
 the french who had occupied the fled and our 
shouting  them so far the that it was difficult 
to call them back  the prisoners were brought down 
from the and among them was a french general whom 
the officers of known to pierre and some and french 
with faces distorted by suffering walked and were carried on 
from the pierre again went up onto the where he 
had spent over an hour and of that family circle 
which had received him as a member he did not 
find a single one there were many dead whom he 
did not know but some he recognized the young officer 
still sat in the same way bent in a of 
blood at the edge of the earth wall the red 
man was still but they did not carry him away 
 pierre ran down the once more   they 
will stop it now they will be at what they 
have done he thought going toward a crowd of moving 
from the  but behind the of smoke the sun 
was still high and in front and especially to the 
left near something seemed to be in the smoke and 
the of and did not diminish but even to desperation 
like a man who himself with all his remaining strength 
     chapter   the chief 
of the battle of was fought within the seven thousand 
feet between and that space there was on the one 
side a made by the russians with cavalry at and 
on the other side with but these two were and 
actions in with what took place in the center of 
the on the field between and the beside the wood 
the chief of the day took place on an open 
space visible from both sides and was fought in the 
simplest and most way  the battle began on both 
sides with a from several hundred  then when the 
whole field was covered with smoke two and from the 
french right while on from their left  from the 
where napoleon was standing the were two of a mile 
away and it was more than a mile as the 
to so that napoleon could not see what was there 
especially as the smoke mingling with the hid the whole 
the soldiers of against the could only be seen till 
they had entered the hollow that lay between them and 
the as soon as they had into that hollow the 
smoke of the and on the grew so that it 
covered the whole on that side of it through the 
smoke could be caught of something black men at times 
the of but whether they were moving or whether they 
were french or russian could not be discovered from the 
 the sun had and its struck straight into napoleon 
face as his eyes with his hand he looked at 
the the smoke spread out before them and at times 
it looked as if the smoke were moving at times 
as if the moved sometimes shouts were heard through the 
but it was impossible to tell what was being done 
there  napoleon standing on the looked through a field 
glass and in its small saw smoke and men sometimes 
his own and sometimes russians but when he looked again 
with the eye he could not tell where what he 
had seen was  he the and began up and 
down before it  occasionally he stopped listened to the 
and gazed at the  but not only was it 
impossible to make out what was from where he was 
standing down below or from the above on which some 
of his had taken their stand but even from the 
themselves which by this time there were now russian and 
now french soldiers or together dead frightened or at those 
themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking 
place there for several hours amid and fire now russians 
were seen alone now alone now infantry and now cavalry 
they appeared fell not knowing what to do with one 
another screamed and ran back again  from the adjutants 
he had sent out and from his kept up to 
napoleon with reports of the progress of the but all 
these reports were both because it was impossible in the 
heat of battle to say what was at any given 
moment and because many of the adjutants did not go 
to the place of but what they had heard from 
others and also because while an adjutant was more than 
a mile to napoleon circumstances changed and the news he 
brought was already becoming thus an adjutant up from with 
that had been occupied and the bridge over the was 
in the hands of the french the adjutant asked whether 
napoleon wished the to cross it napoleon gave orders that 
the should form up on the farther side and wait 
but before that order was given as soon in fact 
as the adjutant had left bridge had been by the 
russians and in the very at which pierre had been 
present at the beginning of the battle  an adjutant 
up from the with a pale and frightened face and 
to napoleon that their attack had been and killed yet 
at the very time the adjutant had been told that 
the french had been the had in fact been by 
other french and was and only slightly on the of 
these reports napoleon gave his orders which had either been 
before he gave them or could not be and were 
not  the and who were nearer to the field 
of battle but like napoleon did not take part in 
the and only occasionally went within made their own without 
asking napoleon and orders where and in what direction to 
fire and where cavalry should and infantry should run but 
even their orders like napoleon were carried out and then 
but for the most part things happened contrary to their 
orders soldiers ordered to ran back on meeting soldiers ordered 
to remain where they were suddenly seeing russians unexpectedly before 
them sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward and the cavalry 
dashed without orders in of the flying russians in this 
way two cavalry through the hollow and as soon as 
they reached the top of the turned round and full 
speed back again the infantry moved in the same way 
sometimes running to quite other places than those they were 
ordered to go to all orders as to where and 
when to move the when to send infantry to or 
to ride down the russian infantry such orders were given 
by the officers on the spot to the concerned without 
asking either or much less napoleon they did not fear 
getting into trouble for not orders or for on their 
own for in battle what is at stake is what 
is to man own life it sometimes seems that safety 
lies in running back sometimes in running forward and these 
men who were right in the heat of the battle 
acted to the mood of the moment in however all 
these movements forward and backward did not or the position 
of the all their rushing and at one another did 
little the of and death was by the balls and 
that over the on which these men were about as 
soon as they left the place where the balls and 
were flying about their in the them and brought them 
under and under the influence of that led them back 
to the of fire where under the influence of fear 
of death they lost their and rushed about to the 
of the      chapter   
napoleon and who were near that region of fire and 
sometimes even entered it led into it huge of well 
but contrary to what had always happened in their former 
instead of the news they expected of the flight these 
returned as and terrified the them but their constantly in 
the middle of the day sent his adjutant to napoleon 
to demand  napoleon sat at the foot of the 
drinking when adjutant up with an assurance that the russians 
would be if his majesty would let him have another 
  said napoleon in a tone of stern surprise 
looking at the adjutant handsome lad with long black curls 
arranged like own though he did not understand his words 
  thought napoleon to himself  can they need 
when they already have half the army against a weak 
russian   the king of said he sternly  
it is not yet and i don yet see my 
clearly go  the handsome boy adjutant with the long 
hair deeply without his hand from his hat and back 
to where men were being  napoleon rose and having 
and began talking to them about matters with the battle 
 in the midst of this conversation which was beginning 
to interest napoleon eyes turned to look at a general 
with a who was toward the on a horse it 
was having he went up to the emperor with and 
in a loud voice began boldly the necessity of sending 
he on his honor that the russians were lost if 
the emperor would give another  napoleon shrugged his shoulders 
and continued to up and down without began talking loudly 
and eagerly to the of the around him   
are very said napoleon when he again came up to 
the general  the heat of a battle it is 
easy to make a mistake go and have another look 
and then come back to me  before was out 
of sight a from another part of the up  
 then what do you want asked napoleon in the 
tone of a man at being continually disturbed   
the prince began the adjutant   for said napoleon 
with an angry gesture  the adjutant bent his head 
and began to report but the emperor turned from him 
took a of steps stopped came back and called  
 must give he said moving his arms slightly apart 
 do you think should be sent there he asked 
of  he subsequently  i have made an  
 replied who knew all the and by heart  
napoleon nodded  the adjutant to and a few minutes 
later the young guards behind the moved forward napoleon gazed 
silently in that direction   he suddenly said to 
 can send send  though there was no in 
sending instead of and even in obvious and delay in 
stopping and sending now the order was carried out exactly 
napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army 
he was playing the part of a doctor who by 
his role he so understood and  as the others 
had done into the smoke of the from all sides 
adjutants continued to arrive at a and as if by 
all said the same thing they all asked for and 
all said that the russians were holding their positions and 
a fire under which the french army was away  
napoleon sat on a wrapped in thought  de the 
man so fond of travel having since morning came up 
to the emperor and respectfully to to his majesty  
 hope i may now congratulate your majesty on a 
said he  napoleon silently shook his head in assuming 
the to only to the and not to the de 
with to remark that there is no reason for not 
having when one can get it   away exclaimed 
napoleon suddenly and and turned aside  a smile of 
regret and beamed on de face and he away to 
the other  napoleon was experiencing a feeling of like 
that of an ever gambler who after money about and 
always winning suddenly just when he has all the of 
the game finds that the more he considers his play 
the more he loses  his were the same his 
the same the same had been made the same and 
the same he himself was still the same he knew 
that and knew that he was now even more experienced 
and than before even the was the same as at 
and the terrible of his arm had become  all 
the old that had been with success the of on 
one point an attack by to break the line and 
a cavalry attack by  men of iron all these 
had already been employed yet not only was there no 
but from all sides came the same news of killed 
and of of the impossibility of back the russians and 
of among his own  after he had given two 
or three orders and uttered a few phrases and adjutants 
had come up with and happy faces the taken the 
corps of prisoners of and and and had only begged 
leave to the cavalry to in the so it had 
been at arcola and so on but now something strange 
was to his  despite news of the of the 
napoleon saw that this was not the same not at 
all the same as what had happened in his former 
he saw that what he was feeling was felt by 
all the men about him experienced in the art of 
war all their faces looked and they all one another 
eyes a de could to the meaning of what was 
 but napoleon with his long experience of war well 
knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the 
side in eight hours after all had been he knew 
that it was a lost battle and that the least 
might now the fight on such a strained center him 
and his army  when he ran his mind over 
the whole of this strange russian in which not one 
battle had been won and in which not a flag 
or or army corps had been captured in two months 
when he looked at the on the faces around him 
and heard reports of the russians still holding their ground 
terrible feeling like a took of him and all the 
that might him occurred to his mind the russians might 
fall on his left might break through his center he 
himself might be killed by a ball all this was 
possible in former he had only considered the of success 
but now themselves and he expected them all yes it 
was like a in which a man fancies that a 
is coming to attack him and his arm to that 
a terrible blow which he knows should him but then 
that his arm powerless and like a and the horror 
of him in his  the news that the russians 
were the left of the french army that horror in 
napoleon he sat silently on a below the with head 
bowed and elbows on his knees approached and suggested that 
they should ride along the line to the position of 
affairs   what do you say asked napoleon  
tell them to bring me my horse  he and 
toward  amid the smoke slowly over the whole space 
through which napoleon horses and men were lying in of 
blood singly or in neither napoleon nor any of his 
had ever before seen such horrors or so many in 
such a small area the of that had not ceased 
for ten hours wearied the and gave a peculiar to 
the as music does to napoleon up the high ground 
at and through the smoke saw ranks of men in 
of a color to him they were russians  the 
russians stood in ranks behind village and its and their 
along their line and sent of smoke it was no 
longer a battle it was a which could be of 
no either to the french or the russians napoleon stopped 
his horse and again fell into the from which had 
him he could not stop what was going on before 
him and around him and was to be by him 
and to on him and from its lack of success 
this affair for the first time seemed to him unnecessary 
and horrible  one of the up to napoleon and 
to to lead the old into and standing near napoleon 
exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general  napoleon 
bowed his head and remained silent a long time  
 eight hundred from france i will not have my 
destroyed he said and turning his horse back to  
    chapter   on the where 
pierre had seen him in the morning sat kutuzov his 
gray head hanging his heavy body he gave no orders 
but only to or from what others suggested   
yes do that he replied to  yes go dear 
boy and have a look he would say to one 
or another of those about him or  don we 
better wait he listened to the reports that were brought 
him and gave directions when his demanded that of him 
but when listening to the reports it seemed as if 
he were not interested in the of the words spoken 
but rather in something else the expression of face and 
tone of voice of those who were by long years 
of military experience he knew and with the of age 
understood that it is impossible for one man to direct 
of thousands of others with death and he knew that 
the result of a battle is decided not by the 
orders of a commander in chief nor the place where 
the are nor by the number of or of men 
but by that force called the spirit of the army 
and he watched this force and it in as far 
as that was in his power  kutuzov general expression 
was one of concentrated quiet attention and his face wore 
a strained look as if he found it difficult to 
the of his old and body  at o they 
brought him news that the captured by the french had 
been but that prince was kutuzov and swayed his head 
  over to prince peter and find out about 
it exactly he said to one of his adjutants and 
then turned to the of who was standing behind him 
  your please take command of the first army 
 soon after the he could possibly have reached adjutant 
came back from him and told kutuzov that the asked 
for more  kutuzov made a grimace and sent an 
order to to take over the command of the first 
army and a request to the he said he could 
not spare at such an important moment return to him 
when they brought him news that had been taken and 
the staff officers him kutuzov smiled   a little 
gentlemen said he  battle is won and there is 
nothing extraordinary in the of still it is better to 
wait before we rejoice  but he sent an adjutant 
to take the news round the army  when came 
from the left with news that the french had captured 
the and the village of kutuzov by the sounds of 
the battle and by looks that the news was bad 
rose as if to his legs and taking arm led 
him aside   my dear fellow he said to 
 see whether something can be done  kutuzov was 
in near the center of the russian position the attack 
by napoleon against our left had been several times in 
the center the french had not got and on their 
left cavalry had put the french to flight  toward 
three o the french ceased on the faces of all 
who came from the field of battle and of those 
who stood around him kutuzov noticed an expression of extreme 
he was satisfied with the day success success his expectations 
but the old man strength was him several times his 
head dropped low as if it were falling and he 
off dinner was brought him  adjutant general the man 
who when past prince andrew had said  war should 
be widely and whom so up while kutuzov was at 
dinner had come from de to report on the progress 
of affairs on the left the de seeing of men 
running back and the of the army all the circumstances 
concluded that the battle was lost and sent his favorite 
officer to the commander in chief with that news  
kutuzov was a piece of roast with difficulty and glanced 
at with eyes that brightened under their puckering  his 
legs approached kutuzov with a half smile on his lips 
scarcely touching the of his cap  he treated his 
serene with a affected intended to show that as a 
highly military man he left it to russians to make 
an of this old man but that he knew whom 
he was with   in their own set the 
called kutuzov  making himself very comfortable thought and looking 
severely at the dishes in front of kutuzov he began 
to report to  old the position of affairs on 
the left as had ordered him to and as he 
himself had seen and understood it   the of 
our position are in the hands and we cannot them 
for lack of the men are running away and it 
is impossible to stop them he  kutuzov ceased and 
fixed an astonished on as if not understanding what was 
said to him noticing  old agitation said with a 
smile   have not considered it right to from 
your serene what i have seen the are in complete 
  have seen you have seen kutuzov shouted frowning 
and rising quickly he went up to   how 
you he shouted and making a threatening gesture with his 
arms  you sir say that to me you know 
nothing about it tell general from me that his information 
is and that the real course of the battle is 
better known to me the commander in chief than to 
him  was about to make a rejoinder but kutuzov 
interrupted him   has been on the left and 
on the right if you have seen sir do not 
allow yourself to say what you don know be so 
good as to ride to general and inform him of 
my firm intention to attack the tomorrow said kutuzov sternly 
 all were silent and the only sound audible was 
the heavy breathing of the old general   are 
everywhere for which i thank god and our army the 
is and tomorrow we shall drive him from the soil 
of russia said kutuzov crossing himself and he suddenly sobbed 
as his eyes filled with tears  shrugging his shoulders 
and his lips stepped silently aside at  old  
 here he is my hero said kutuzov to a 
portly handsome dark general who was just the  this 
was who had spent the whole day at the most 
important part of the field of  that the were 
firmly holding their ground and that the french no longer 
to attack  after hearing him kutuzov said in french 
  you do not think like some others that 
we must   the contrary your in actions it 
is always the most who remain replied  in my 
opinion   kutuzov called to his adjutant  down 
and write out the order of the day for tomorrow 
and you he continued addressing another  along the line 
and announce that tomorrow we attack  while kutuzov was 
talking to and the order of the day returned from 
and said that general wished to have written of the 
order the field had given  kutuzov without looking at 
gave directions for the order to be written out which 
the former commander in chief to avoid responsibility very wished 
to receive  and by means of that which an 
army one and the same known as  spirit of 
the army and which constitutes the of war kutuzov words 
his order for a battle next day immediately became known 
from one end of the army to the other  
it was far from being the same words or the 
same order that reached the of that chain the passing 
from mouth to mouth at different of the army did 
not even what kutuzov had said but the sense of 
his words spread everywhere because what he said was not 
the of but of a feeling that lay in the 
commander in chief soul as in that of every russian 
 and on learning that tomorrow they were to attack 
the and hearing from the highest a of what they 
wanted to believe the exhausted men felt and   
   chapter   prince andrew regiment was 
among the which till after one o were behind under 
heavy fire toward two o the regiment having already lost 
more than two hundred men was moved forward into a 
in the between and the where thousands of men perished 
that day and on which an concentrated fire from several 
hundred was between one and two o  without moving 
from that spot or a single the regiment here lost 
another third of its men from in front and especially 
from the right in the smoke the and out of 
the of smoke that the whole space in front quick 
balls and at times as if to allow them a 
a of an hour passed during which the balls and 
all but sometimes several men were from the regiment in 
a minute and the were continually being away and the 
carried off  with each fresh blow less and less 
of life remained for those not yet killed the regiment 
stood in of three hundred apart but nevertheless the men 
were always in one and the same mood all alike 
were and talk was heard in the ranks and it 
ceased every time the of a and the cry of 
 was heard most of the time by their officers 
order the men sat on the ground one having taken 
off his carefully the of its and drew them again 
another rubbing some dry between his polished his another the 
and pulled the of his while another smoothed and his 
and put his on again some built little of the 
in the ground or from the straw in the all 
seemed fully in these when men were killed or when 
rows of went past when some and when great of 
the came into through the smoke no one paid any 
attention to these things but when our or cavalry or 
some of our infantry were seen to move forward words 
of approval were heard on all sides but the attention 
was by quite apart from and with the battle it 
was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men 
found relief in a of was passing in front of 
the regiment the horse of an put its over a 
trace  look at the trace horse get her out 
she fall ah they don see it came shouts from 
the ranks all along the regiment another time general attention 
was by a small brown dog coming heaven knows which 
in a manner in front of the ranks with tail 
erect till suddenly a fell close by when it tucked 
its tail between its legs and darted aside and of 
laughter rose from the whole regiment but such only a 
moment and for eight hours the men had been without 
food in constant fear of death and their pale and 
gloomy faces grew ever and  prince andrew pale and 
gloomy like everyone in the regiment up and down from 
the of one patch to another at the edge of 
the beside an with head bowed and arms behind his 
back there was nothing for him to do and no 
orders to be given everything went on of itself the 
killed were from the front the carried away and the 
ranks closed up if any soldiers ran to the they 
returned immediately and hastily at first prince andrew considering it 
his duty to rouse the courage of the men and 
to set them an example walked about among the ranks 
but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and 
that there was nothing he could them all the of 
his soul as of every there were bent on the 
of the horrors of their situation he walked along the 
his feet rustling the grass and gazing at the dust 
that covered his now he took big trying to keep 
to the left on the by the then he counted 
his steps how often he must walk from one to 
another to walk a mile then he the flowers from 
the that grew along a rubbed them in his and 
their sweetly nothing remained of the previous day thoughts he 
thought of nothing he listened with weary ears to the 
ever sounds the of flying from the of the reports 
glanced at the familiar faces of the men of the 
first and waited  it comes this one is coming 
our way again he thought listening to an approaching in 
the region of smoke  another again it has hit 
he stopped and looked at the ranks  it has 
gone over but this one has hit and again he 
started trying to reach the in sixteen a and a 
five from him a ball up the dry earth and 
a ran down his back again he glanced at the 
ranks probably many had been hit large crowd had gathered 
near the second   he shouted  them not 
to crowd together  the adjutant having this approached prince 
andrew from the other side a commander up   
out came a frightened cry from a and like a 
in flight and on the ground a dropped with little 
noise within two steps of prince andrew and close to 
the commander horse the horse first of whether it was 
right or wrong to show fear almost the major and 
aside the horse the men   down cried the 
adjutant himself flat on the ground  prince andrew the 
smoking like a top between him and the adjutant near 
a plant between the field and the   this 
be death thought prince andrew looking with a quite new 
envious glance at the grass the and the of smoke 
that up from the black ball  cannot i do 
not wish to die i love life love this grass 
this earth this air he thought this and at the 
same time remembered that people were looking at him  
 shameful sir he said to the adjutant   
he did not finish speaking at one and the same 
moment came the sound of an a of as from 
a breaking window frame a smell of and prince andrew 
started to one side raising his arm and fell on 
his chest several officers ran up to him from the 
right side of his blood was out making a large 
on the grass  the with who were called up 
stood behind the officers prince andrew lay on his chest 
with his face in the grass breathing heavily and  
 are you waiting for come along  the went 
up and took him by his shoulders and legs but 
he and exchanging looks they set him down again  
 him up lift him it all the same cried 
someone  they again took him by the shoulders and 
laid him on the   god my god what 
is it the that means death my god among the 
officers were heard saying   a hair past my 
said the adjutant  the adjusting the to their shoulders 
started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down to 
the   in step ah those shouted an officer 
by their shoulders and the who were and the  
 into step i say said the   that 
right said the one behind joyfully when he had got 
into step   excellency eh prince said the voice 
of who had run up and was looking down on 
the  prince andrew opened his eyes and looked up 
at the speaker from the into which his head had 
deep and again his drooped   the carried prince 
andrew to the by the wood where were the of 
three with turned back at the edge of a wood 
in the wood and horses were standing the horses were 
from their and down and the that fell some blood 
among the around the over more than five men in 
stood sat or lay around the stood of with and 
attentive faces whom the officers keeping order tried in vain 
to drive from the spot the officers orders the soldiers 
stood against their and gazing as if trying to the 
difficult problem of what was taking place before them from 
the came now loud angry and now occasionally ran out 
to water or to point out those who were to 
be brought in next the men awaiting their turn outside 
the wept screamed or asked for some were prince andrew 
over the who had not yet been took him as 
a commander close up to one of the and there 
stopped awaiting prince andrew opened his eyes and for a 
long time could not make out what was going on 
around him he remembered the the the field the black 
ball and his rush of passionate love of life two 
steps from him against a and talking loudly and general 
attention stood a tall handsome black officer with a head 
he had been in the head and by around him 
eagerly listening to his talk a crowd of and was 
gathered   him out from there so that he 
everything we the king himself cried he looking around him 
with eyes that with  only had come up just 
then there have been nothing left of him i tell 
you  like all the others near the speaker prince 
andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a 
sense of  isn it all the same now thought 
he  what will be there and what has there 
been here why was i so to part with life 
there was something in this life i did not and 
do not understand      chapter  
 one of the doctors came out of the in 
a holding a between the and little finger of one 
of his small hands so as not to it he 
raised his head and looked about him but above the 
of the men he evidently wanted a little after turning 
his head from right to left for some time he 
and looked down   right immediately he replied to 
a who pointed prince andrew out to him and he 
told them to carry him into the  among the 
who were waiting   seems that even in the 
next world only the are to have a remarked one 
 prince andrew was carried in and laid on a 
table that had only just been and which a was 
down prince andrew could not make out distinctly what was 
in that the from all sides and the in his 
and back him all he saw about him into a 
general of human that seemed to the whole of the 
low as a few on that hot august day such 
had filled the dirty beside the road yes it was 
the same the same chair a the sight of which 
had even then filled him with horror as by a 
 there were three tables in the two were occupied 
and on the third they placed prince andrew for a 
little while he was left alone and what was taking 
place on the other two tables on the one sat 
a probably a cossack by the uniform thrown down beside 
him four soldiers were holding him and a doctor was 
into his muscular brown back   the and suddenly 
lifting up his face with its high and his white 
teeth he began to and his body and utter piercing 
ringing and on the other table round which many people 
were crowding a tall well man lay on his back 
with his head thrown back his curly hair its color 
and the shape of his head seemed familiar to prince 
andrew several were pressing on his chest to hold him 
down one large white plump rapidly all the time with 
a the man was sobbing and convulsively two doctors of 
whom was pale and silently doing something to this man 
other when he had finished with the whom they covered 
with an the doctor came up to prince andrew wiping 
his hands  he glanced at prince andrew face and 
quickly turned away   him what are you waiting 
for he cried angrily to the  his very first 
of childhood came back to prince andrew mind when the 
with sleeves rolled up began hastily to the buttons of 
his clothes and him the doctor bent down over the 
wound felt it and deeply then he made a sign 
to someone and the in his prince andrew to lose 
consciousness when he came to himself the of his had 
been the cut away and the wound water was being 
on his face as soon as prince andrew opened his 
eyes the doctor bent over kissed him silently on the 
lips and hurried away  after the sufferings he had 
been prince andrew enjoyed a feeling such as he had 
not experienced for a long time all the best and 
moments of his life his childhood when he used to 
be and put to bed and when over him his 
nurse sang him to sleep and he his head in 
the felt happy in the mere consciousness of life to 
his memory not merely as something past but as something 
present  the doctors were busily engaged with the man 
the shape of whose head seemed familiar to prince andrew 
they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him 
  it to me oh oh oh his frightened 
could be heard subdued by suffering and broken by  
hearing those prince andrew wanted to whether because he was 
dying without glory or because he was sorry to part 
with life or because of those of a childhood that 
could not return or because he was suffering and others 
were suffering and that man near him was so felt 
like weeping childlike kindly and almost happy tears  the 
man was shown his with blood and with the still 
on   oh he sobbed like a woman  
the doctor who had been standing beside him prince andrew 
from seeing his face moved away   god what 
is this why is he here said prince andrew to 
himself  in the sobbing man whose had just been 
he recognized anatole kuragin men were him in their arms 
and him a glass of water but his lips could 
not its anatole was sobbing  it is he yes 
that man is somehow and connected with me thought prince 
andrew not yet clearly what he saw before him  
is the connection of that man with my childhood and 
life he asked himself without finding an answer and suddenly 
a new memory from that of and childhood itself to 
him he remembered natasha as he had seen her for 
the first time at the ball in  with her 
slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face 
ready for and love and tenderness for her and more 
than ever in his soul he now remembered the connection 
that between himself and this man who was gazing at 
him through tears that filled his eyes he remembered everything 
and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his 
happy heart  prince andrew could no longer restrain himself 
and wept tender tears for his fellow men for himself 
and for his own and their   love of 
our for those who love us and for those who 
hate us love of our yes that love which god 
preached on earth and which princess mary taught me and 
i did not understand is what made me sorry to 
part with life that is what remained for me had 
i lived but now it is too late i know 
it      chapter   the 
terrible of the covered with dead and together with the 
of his head and the news that some twenty he 
knew personally had been killed or and the consciousness of 
the of his once arm produced an on napoleon who 
usually liked to look at the killed and he considered 
his strength of mind this day the horrible appearance of 
the that strength of mind which he thought his and 
his greatness he hurriedly from the and returned to the 
where he sat on his his sallow face and heavy 
his eyes his nose red and his voice listening with 
eyes to the sounds of with painful he the end 
of this in which he regarded himself as a and 
which he was unable to a human feeling for a 
moment got the better of the artificial of life he 
had served so long he felt in his own person 
the sufferings and death he had on the the of 
his head and chest reminded him of the of suffering 
and death for himself at that moment he did not 
desire moscow or or glory  need had he for 
any more glory the one thing he wished for was 
rest and freedom but when he had been on the 
the commander had to him to bring several of up 
to those to the fire on the russian crowded in 
front of napoleon had and had given orders that news 
should be brought to him of the effect those produced 
 an adjutant came now to inform him that the 
fire of two hundred had been concentrated on the russians 
as he had ordered but that they still held their 
ground   fire is them down by rows but 
still they hold on said the adjutant   want 
more said napoleon in a voice   asked the 
adjutant who had not heard the remark   want 
more napoleon frowning  them have it  even before 
he gave that order the thing he did not desire 
and for which he gave the order only because he 
thought it was expected of him was being done and 
he fell back into that artificial of imaginary greatness and 
again a horse a thinks it is doing something for 
itself the cruel sad gloomy and role for him  
and not for that day and hour alone were the 
mind and conscience of this man on whom the responsibility 
for what was lay more than on all the others 
who took part in it never to the end of 
his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or 
the of his actions which were too contrary to goodness 
and truth too from everything human for him ever to 
be able to their meaning he could not his actions 
as they were by half the world and so he 
had to truth goodness and all  not only on 
that day as he over the with men killed and 
 his will as he believed did he reckon as 
he looked at them how many russians there were for 
each frenchman and himself find reason for in the that 
there were five russians for every frenchman not on that 
day alone did he write in a letter to paris 
that  battle field was because fifty thousand lay there 
but even on the island of st in the where 
he said he intended to his to an account of 
the great he had done he wrote   the 
russian war should have been the most popular war of 
modern times it was a war of good sense for 
real interests for the and of all it was and 
 it was a war for a great cause the 
end of and the beginning of a new and new 
were opening out full of well and for all the 
system was already all that remained was to it  
satisfied on these great and with everywhere i too should 
have had my and my alliance those ideas were from 
me in that of great sovereigns we should have discussed 
our interests like one family and have account to the 
as clerk to  europe would in this way soon 
have been in fact but one people and anyone who 
anywhere would have found himself always in the common i 
should have demanded the freedom of all for everybody that 
the should be common to all and that the great 
standing should be to mere guards for the sovereigns  
on returning to france to the bosom of the great 
strong and i should have her all future wars all 
i should have my son in the empire my would 
have been finished and his would have  paris would 
have been the capital of the world and the french 
the of the nations  my then and my old 
age would have been devoted in company with the empress 
and during the apprenticeship of my son to leisurely visiting 
with our own horses and like a true country every 
corner of the empire receiving and public and on all 
sides and everywhere   napoleon by for the gloomy 
role of of the himself that the aim of his 
actions had been the welfare and that he could control 
the fate of millions and by the of power  
  four hundred thousand who the he wrote further 
of the russian war  were and the imperial army 
speaking was one third of men from the of the 
of the thirty military of of and so on it 
scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke french the 
russian expedition cost france less than fifty thousand men the 
russian army in its from to moscow lost in the 
four times more men than the french army the burning 
of moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians 
who died of cold and want in the finally in 
its march from moscow to the the russian army also 
from the severity of the so that by the time 
it reached it only fifty thousand and at less than 
thousand   he imagined that the war with russia 
came about by his will and the horrors that occurred 
did not his soul he boldly took the whole responsibility 
for what happened and his mind found in the that 
among the of thousands who perished there were than and 
     chapter   several tens 
of thousands of the lay in and on the and 
belonging to the family and to the serfs and where 
for of years the of and had their and their 
cattle at the the grass and earth were with blood 
for a space of some three around of men of 
arms and with frightened faces themselves back to from the 
one army and back to from the other other exhausted 
and went forward led by their officers others held their 
ground and continued to fire  over the whole field 
so gaily beautiful with the of and of smoke in 
the morning sun there now spread a of and smoke 
and a strange smell of and blood gathered and of 
rain began to fall on the dead and on the 
frightened exhausted and men as if to say  men 
enough what are you doing  to the men of 
both sides alike worn out by want of food and 
rest it began to appear doubtful whether they should continue 
to one another all the faces expressed and the question 
in every soul  what for whom must i kill 
and be killed you may go and kill whom you 
please but i don want to do so by evening 
this thought had in every soul at any moment these 
men might have been seized with horror at what they 
were doing and might have thrown up everything and run 
away anywhere  but though toward the end of the 
battle the men felt all the horror of what they 
were doing though they would have been glad to leave 
off some power continued to control them and they still 
brought up the and the match though only one out 
of every three and though they and with and with 
blood and the balls just as swiftly and from both 
sides human and that terrible work which was not done 
by the will of a man but at the will 
of him who men and continued  anyone looking at 
the of the russian army would have said that if 
only the french made one more slight effort it would 
and anyone looking at the of the french army would 
have said that the russians need only make one more 
slight effort and the french would be destroyed but neither 
the french nor the russians made that effort and the 
of battle slowly out  the russians did not make 
that effort because they were not the french at the 
beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to 
moscow and they still did so at the end of 
the battle as at the beginning but even had the 
aim of the russians been to drive the french from 
their positions they could not have made this last effort 
for all the russian had been broken up there was 
no part of the russian army that had not in 
the battle and though still holding their positions they had 
lost one half of their army  the french with 
the memory of all their former during fifteen years with 
the assurance of napoleon with the consciousness that they had 
captured part of the and had lost only a of 
their men and still had their guards twenty thousand strong 
might easily have made that effort the french who had 
attacked the russian army in order to drive it from 
its position ought to have made that effort for as 
long as the russians continued to block the road to 
moscow as before the aim of the french had not 
been and all their and were in vain but the 
french did not make that effort some say that napoleon 
need only have used his old guards who were and 
the battle would have been won to speak of what 
would have happened had napoleon sent his guards is like 
talking of what would happen if became spring it could 
not be napoleon did not give his guards not because 
he did not want to but because it could not 
be done all the officers and soldiers of the french 
army knew it could not be done because the spirit 
of the would not it  it was not napoleon 
alone who had experienced that feeling of the arm being 
powerless but all the and soldiers of his army whether 
they had taken part in the battle or not after 
all their experience of previous after one tenth of such 
the had fled a feeling of before an who after 
losing half his men stood as threateningly at the end 
as at the beginning of the battle the force of 
the french army was exhausted not that sort of which 
is by the of of material to called and of 
the ground on which the had stood and were standing 
but a that the of the superiority of his and 
of his own was gained by the russians at the 
french like an animal that has in its received a 
wound felt that they were but could not stop any 
more than the russian army by one half could help 
by gained the french army was still able to forward 
to moscow but there without further effort on the part 
of the russians it had to from the wound it 
had received at the direct of the battle of was 
napoleon flight from moscow his along the old road the 
of the army of five hundred thousand men and the 
of france on which at for the first time the 
hand of an of spirit had been laid   
   book       
chapter i   absolute of motion is not to 
the human mind of motion of any kind become to 
man only when he elements of that motion but at 
the same time a large proportion of human comes from 
the of motion into elements there is a well known 
so of the in this that could never catch up 
with a he was following in spite of the fact 
that he ten times as fast as the by the 
time has covered the distance that him from the the 
has covered one tenth of that distance of him when 
has covered that tenth the has covered another one and 
so on forever this problem seemed to the the absurd 
answer  could never the from this that motion was 
divided into elements the motion both of and of the 
was  by and elements of motion we only a 
of the problem but never reach it only when we 
have the of the small and the resulting with a 
common of one tenth and have found the sum of 
this to do we reach a of the problem  
a modern of having the art of with the small 
can now in other more of motion which used to 
appear  this modern of to the when with of 
motion the of the small and so to the chief 
condition of motion  and the which the human mind 
cannot avoid when it with separate elements of motion instead 
of motion  in the of movement just the same 
thing happens the movement of as it does from human 
is  to understand the of this movement is the 
aim of history but to arrive at these resulting from 
the sum of all those human man mind and the 
first method of history is to take an of and 
it apart from others though there is and can be 
no beginning to any for one always from another  
the second method is to consider the actions of some 
one man king or a commander to the sum of 
many the sum of is never expressed by the of 
a single  science in its to draw nearer to 
truth continually takes and for but however small the it 
takes we feel that to take any unit from others 
or to a beginning of any or to say that 
the will of many men is expressed by the actions 
of any one is in itself  it no to 
to dust any drawn from history it is merely necessary 
to some larger or unit as the subject of observation 
has every right to do seeing that unit history must 
always be  only by taking small for observation  
of history that is the of men and to the 
art of them  is finding the sum of these 
can we hope to arrive at the of history  
the first fifteen years of the century in europe present 
an extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their 
from one side of europe to the other and one 
another and are in despair and for some years the 
whole course of life is altered and an movement which 
first and then what was the cause of this movement 
by what was it asks the mind of man  
the to this question lay before us the and of 
a few men in a building in the city of 
paris calling these and  revolution then they give a 
of napoleon and of certain people or to him tell 
of the influence some of these people had on others 
and say that is why this movement took place and 
those are its  but the mind of man not 
only to believe this but plainly says that this method 
of is because in it a is taken as the 
cause of a the sum of human produced the revolution 
and napoleon and only the sum of those first and 
then destroyed them   every time there have been 
there have been every time there has been a revolution 
in any state there have been great men says history 
and indeed human reason every time appear there have been 
wars but this does not prove that the the wars 
and that it is possible to find the of a 
war in the of a single man whenever i look 
at my watch and its hands point to ten i 
hear the of the but because the begin to ring 
when the hands of the clock reach ten i have 
no right to that the movement of the is by 
the position of the hands of the watch  whenever 
i see the movement of a i hear the and 
see the opening and wheels turning but i have no 
right to that the and the turning of wheels are 
the cause of the movement of the engine  the 
say that a cold wind in late spring because the 
are and really every spring cold do blow when the 
oak is but though i do not know what causes 
the cold to blow when the oak i cannot agree 
with the that the unfolding of the oak is the 
cause of the cold wind for the force of the 
wind is the influence of the i see only a 
of such as happens with all the of life and 
i see that however much and however carefully i observe 
the hands of the watch and the and wheels of 
the engine and the oak i shall not the cause 
of the ringing the engine moving or of the of 
spring to that i must entirely change my point of 
and study the of the movement of of the and 
of the wind history must do the same and in 
this direction have already been made  to study the 
of history we must completely change the subject of our 
observation must leave aside ministers and and study the common 
small elements by which the are moved no one can 
say in how far it is possible for man to 
in this way toward an understanding of the of history 
but it is evident that only along that path does 
the of the of history lie and that as yet 
not a part as much mental effort has been in 
this direction by as has been devoted to the actions 
of and ministers and the own reflections these actions  
    chapter ii   the forces 
of a nations burst into russia the russian army and 
people a till was reached and again from to the 
french army pushed on to moscow its goal its ever 
as it its aim just as the of a falling 
body as it the earth behind it were seven hundred 
of country were a few it from its goal every 
in napoleon army felt this and the moved on by 
its own  the more the russian army the more 
a spirit of hatred of the up and while it 
the army and at a took place neither army was 
broken up but the russian army immediately after the as 
as a ball after with another having a greater and 
with equal the ball of that had with such rolled 
on for some distance though the had it of all 
its force  the russians eighty moscow the french reached 
moscow and there came to a for five after that 
there was not a single battle the french did not 
move as a animal its they remained in moscow for 
five and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back 
they made a for the road and  a at 
the field of again remained without a single serious battle 
they fled still more rapidly back to the and farther 
still  on the evening of the twenty of august 
kutuzov and the whole russian army were convinced that the 
battle of was a kutuzov so to the emperor he 
gave orders to prepare for a fresh to finish the 
and did this not to anyone but because he knew 
that the was as everyone who had taken part in 
the battle knew it  but all that evening and 
next day reports came in one after another of of 
the of half the army and a fresh battle physically 
impossible  it was impossible to give battle before information 
had been the gathered in the of the up new 
officers appointed to those who had been killed and before 
the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the 
very next morning after the battle the french army of 
itself upon the russians carried forward by the force of 
its own now in proportion to the square of the 
distance from its aim kutuzov wish was to attack next 
day and the whole army desired to do so but 
to make an attack the wish to do so is 
not sufficient there must also be a of doing it 
and that did not exist it was impossible not to 
a day march and then in the same way it 
was impossible not to another and a third day march 
and at last on the first of when the army 
drew near moscow the strength of the feeling that had 
in all ranks force of circumstances compelled it to retire 
moscow and the one more last day march and moscow 
to the  for people accustomed to think that of 
and are made by any one of us sitting over 
a map in his study may imagine how he would 
have arranged things in this or that battle questions present 
themselves why did kutuzov during the not do this or 
that why did he not take up a position before 
reaching why did he not retire at once by the 
road moscow and so on people accustomed to think in 
that way forget or do not know the which always 
the of any commander in chief the of a commander 
in chief does not at all the we imagine to 
ourselves when we sit at ease in our some on 
the map with a certain number of on this and 
that side in a certain known and begin our from 
some given moment a commander in chief is never with 
the beginning of any position from which we always it 
the commander in chief is always in the midst of 
a of and so he never can at any moment 
consider the whole of an that is moment by moment 
the is itself and at every moment of this of 
the commander in chief is in the midst of a 
most play of intrigues and and is continually to reply 
to questions addressed to him which constantly with one another 
 learned military quite seriously tell us that kutuzov should 
have moved his army to the road long before reaching 
and that somebody such a to him but a commander 
in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before 
him not one but and all these on and each 
other  a commander in chief business it would seem 
is simply to choose one of these but even that 
he cannot do and time do not wait for on 
the twenty it is suggested to him to cross to 
the road but just then an adjutant up from asking 
whether he is to the french or retire an order 
must be given him at once that instant and the 
order to us past the turn to the road and 
after the adjutant comes the general asking where the are 
to be taken and the chief of the asks where 
the are to go and a courier from petersburg a 
letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the 
of moscow and the commander in chief rival the man 
who is him  there are always not merely one 
but several such a new to that of turning to 
the road and the commander in chief himself sleep and 
to maintain his energy and a general who has been 
in the of comes to complain and the of the 
to be and an officer sent to the comes in 
and gives a report quite contrary to what was said 
by the officer sent and a a and a general 
who has been on all describe the position of the 
army differently people accustomed to or to forget these of 
a commander in chief actions describe to us for the 
position of the army at and that the commander in 
chief could on the first of quite decide whether to 
moscow or defend it with the russian army less than 
four from moscow no such question when had that question 
been settled at and at and most of all on 
the twenty of august at and on the twenty at 
and each day and hour and minute of the from 
to      chapter iii   
when having been sent by kutuzov to the position told 
the field that it was impossible to fight there before 
moscow and that they must kutuzov looked at him in 
silence   me your hand said he and turning 
it over so as to feel the added  are 
not well my dear fellow think what you are saying 
 kutuzov could not yet admit the of moscow without 
a battle  on the hill four from the of 
moscow kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down 
on a by the a great crowd of gathered round 
him and count who had come out from moscow joined 
them this brilliant company into several groups who all discussed 
the advantages and disadvantages of the position the state of 
the army the suggested the situation of moscow and military 
questions generally though they had not been for the purpose 
and though it was not so called they all felt 
that this was really a of war the conversations all 
with public questions if anyone gave or asked for news 
it was done in a whisper and they immediately to 
general matters no or laughter or smiles even were seen 
among all these men they evidently all made an effort 
to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and 
all these groups while talking among themselves tried to keep 
near the commander in chief  formed the center of 
the gathering and to speak so that he might overhear 
them the commander in chief listened to what was being 
said and sometimes asked them to their remarks but did 
not himself take part in the conversations or express any 
opinion after hearing what was being said by one or 
other of these groups he generally turned away with an 
air of as though they were not speaking of anything 
he wished to hear some discussed the position that had 
been not the position itself so much as the mental 
capacity of those who had it others that a mistake 
had been made earlier and that a battle should have 
been fought two days before others again spoke of the 
battle of which was described by a newly arrived frenchman 
in a uniform  frenchman and one of the german 
serving with the russian army were discussing the of and 
considering the of moscow in a manner count was telling 
a fourth group that he was prepared to die with 
the city train under the of the capital but that 
he still could not help having been left in of 
what was and that had he known it sooner things 
would have been different a group displaying the of their 
discussed the direction the would now have to take a 
group was talking absolute nonsense kutuzov expression grew more and 
more and gloomy from all this talk he saw only 
one thing that to defend moscow was a impossibility in 
the full meaning of those words that is to say 
so impossible that if any commander were to give orders 
to fight would result but the battle would still not 
take place it would not take place because the not 
merely all recognized the position to be impossible but in 
their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its 
how could the lead their to a field of battle 
they considered impossible to hold the lower officers and even 
the soldiers  too reason also considered the position impossible 
and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced as 
they were of if on the position being and others 
still discussed it the question was no longer important in 
itself but only as a pretext for and this kutuzov 
knew well  who had the position warmly his russian 
 could not listen to this without by insisting that 
moscow must be his aim was as clear as to 
kutuzov if the defense failed to throw the on kutuzov 
who had brought the army as far as the sparrow 
hills without giving battle if it succeeded to the success 
as his own or if battle were not given to 
clear himself of the of moscow but this did not 
now the old man mind one terrible question him and 
to that question he heard no reply from anyone the 
question for him now was  i really allowed napoleon 
to reach moscow and when did i do so when 
was it decided can it have been yesterday when i 
ordered to or was it the evening before when i 
had a nap and told to orders or was it 
earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow 
must be the army must and the order to do 
so must be given to give that terrible order seemed 
to him to the command of the army and not 
only did he love power to which he was accustomed 
 to prince under whom he had served in him 
but he was convinced that he was to save russia 
and that that was why against the emperor wish and 
by the will of the people he had been commander 
in chief he was convinced that he alone could maintain 
command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that 
in all the world he alone could the invincible napoleon 
without fear and he was at the thought of the 
order he had to but something had to be decided 
and these conversations around him which were assuming too free 
a character must be stopped  he called the most 
important to him   head be it good or 
bad must on itself said he rising from the and 
he to where his carriages were waiting    
  chapter iv   the of war began 
to at two in the in the better and part 
of andrew the men women and children of the large 
family crowded into the back room across the passage only 
andrew six whom his serene had and to whom he 
had given a of while drinking his tea remained on 
the top of the in the larger room looked down 
from the with shy at the faces and of the 
who one after another came into the room and sat 
down on the broad in the corner under the  
himself as in her own mind called kutuzov sat apart 
in a dark corner behind the he sat deep in 
a armchair and continually his and pulled at the collar 
of his coat which though it was still seemed to 
pinch his neck those who entered went up one by 
one to the field he pressed the hands of some 
and nodded to others his adjutant was about to draw 
back the of the window facing kutuzov but the latter 
moved his hand angrily and understood that his serene did 
not wish his face to be seen  round the 
deal table on which lay and papers so many people 
gathered that the brought in another and put it beside 
the table and who had just arrived sat down on 
this in the place immediately under the sat de his 
high forehead merging into his bald he had a st 
george cross round his neck and looked pale and ill 
he had been for two days and was now and 
in beside him sat who with was giving him some 
information speaking in low tones as they all did little 
was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms on his 
on the other side sat count in his own thoughts 
his broad head with its bold features and eyes was 
resting on his hand forward the black hair on his 
as was his habit glanced now at kutuzov and now 
at the door with a look of impatience firm handsome 
and kindly face was lit up by a tender sly 
smile his glance met and the expression of his eyes 
the little girl to smile  they were all waiting 
for who on the pretext of the position was finishing 
his savory dinner they waited for him from four till 
six o and did not begin their all that time 
but talked in low tones of other matters  only 
when had entered the did kutuzov leave his corner and 
draw toward the table but not near enough for the 
candles that had been placed there to light up his 
face  opened the with the question  we to 
russia and capital without a or are we to defend 
it a and general silence followed there was a frown 
on every face and only kutuzov angry and cough broke 
the silence all eyes were gazing at him too looked 
at  she was to him and saw how his 
face puckered he seemed about to cry but this did 
not last long   and capital he suddenly said 
repeating words in an angry voice and drawing attention to 
the note in them  me to tell you your 
excellency that that question has no meaning for a russian 
 his heavy body forward  a question cannot be 
put it is the question i have asked these gentlemen 
to meet to discuss is a military one the question 
is that of russia is it better to give up 
moscow without a battle or by battle to losing the 
army as well as moscow that is the question on 
which i want your opinion and he back in his 
chair  the began did not yet consider his game 
lost admitting the of and others that a battle at 
was impossible but with russian and the love of moscow 
he to move from the right to the left during 
the night and attack the french right the following day 
opinions were divided and were for and against that and 
agreed with whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice 
before the capital or by other these seemed not to 
understand that this could not the course of and that 
moscow was in effect already the other however understood it 
and leaving aside the question of moscow spoke of the 
direction the army should take in its who kept her 
eyes fixed on what was going on before her understood 
the meaning of the differently it seemed to her that 
it was only a between  and  as she 
she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to 
one another and in her heart she with  in 
the midst of the conversation she noticed  give a 
quick subtle glance and then to her joys he saw 
that  said something to  which settled him suddenly 
and angrily up and down the room what so affected 
him was kutuzov calm and quiet on the or of 
to move by night from the right to the left 
to attack the french right   said kutuzov  
cannot of the count plan moving in close to an 
is always dangerous and military history that for kutuzov seemed 
to searching for an example then with a clear naive 
look at he added  yes take the battle of 
which i think the count well and which was not 
fully only because our were too near the  there 
followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them 
all  the but frequently occurred and they all felt 
that there was no more to be said  during 
one of these kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if 
preparing to speak they all looked at him   
gentlemen i see that it is i who will have 
to pay for the broken said he and rising slowly 
he moved to the table  i have heard your 
views some of you will not agree with me but 
i he paused  the to me by my sovereign 
and country order a  after that the began to 
with the solemnity and silence of people who are leaving 
after a  some of the in low tones and 
in a strain very different from the way they had 
spoken during the something to their commander in chief  
who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully down 
from the her bare little feet at its and slipping 
between the legs of the she darted out of the 
room  when he had dismissed the kutuzov sat a 
long time with his elbows on the table thinking always 
of the same terrible question  when did the of 
moscow become when was that done which settled the matter 
and who was to for it   did not 
expect this said he to his adjutant when the latter 
came in late that night  did not expect this 
i did not think this would happen   should 
take some rest your serene replied   no they 
shall eat yet like the exclaimed kutuzov without striking the 
table with his  shall too if only   
   chapter v   at that very 
time in circumstances even more important than without a battle 
the and burning of moscow who is usually as being 
the of that acted in an different manner from kutuzov 
 after the battle of the and burning of moscow 
was as as the of the army moscow without  
every russian might have it not by but by the 
feeling in each of us and in our fathers  
the same thing that took place in moscow had happened 
in all the and on russian soil beginning with without 
the of count and his the people the did not 
or become or tear anyone to but its fate feeling 
within it the strength to find what it should do 
at that most difficult moment and as soon as the 
drew near the wealthy went away their property while the 
remained and and destroyed what was left  the consciousness 
that this would be so and would always be so 
was and is present in the heart of every russian 
and a consciousness of this and a that moscow would 
be taken was present in russian moscow society in  
those who had moscow already in july and at the 
beginning of august showed that they expected this those who 
went away taking what they could and their and half 
their did so from the which itself not by phrases 
or by giving one children to save the and unnatural 
but simply and therefore in the way that always the 
most powerful   is to run away from danger 
only are running away from moscow they were told in 
his on them that to leave moscow was shameful they 
were ashamed to be called ashamed to leave but still 
they left knowing it had to be done why did 
they go it is impossible to suppose that had scared 
them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had committed in 
conquered the first people to go away were the rich 
educated people who knew quite well that vienna and had 
remained and that during napoleon occupation the had spent their 
time in the company of the charming whom the russians 
and especially the russian ladies then liked so much  
they went away because for russians there could be no 
question as to whether things would go well or ill 
under french rule in moscow it was out of the 
question to be under french rule it would be the 
thing that could happen they went away even before the 
battle of and still more rapidly after it despite calls 
to defend moscow or the of his intention to take 
the wonder of the mother of god and go to 
fight or of the that were to the french and 
despite all the nonsense wrote in his they knew that 
it was for the army to fight and that if 
it could not succeed it would not do to take 
young ladies and house serfs to the three hills of 
moscow to fight napoleon and that they must go away 
sorry as they were to their property to they went 
away without thinking of the tremendous of that immense and 
wealthy city being given over to for a great city 
with was certain when by its to be they went 
away each on his own account and yet it was 
only in of their going away that the was accomplished 
that will always remain the greatest glory of the russian 
people the lady who afraid of being stopped by count 
orders had already in moved with her and her women 
from moscow to her with a consciousness that she was 
not bonaparte was really simply and truly carrying out the 
great work which russia but count who now those who 
left moscow and now had the government removed now distributed 
quite to the drunken now had displaying the and now 
father to or the of now seized all the private 
in moscow and on one hundred and thirty of them 
removed the that was being by now that he would 
burn moscow and related how he had set fire to 
his own house now wrote a to the french solemnly 
them for having destroyed his now the glory of having 
that he would burn moscow and now the deed now 
ordered the people to catch all and bring them to 
him and now them for doing so now expelled all 
the french from moscow and now allowed madame  center 
of the whole french in moscow to remain but ordered 
the old to be and for no particular now assembled 
the people at the three hills to fight the french 
and now to get rid of them over to them 
a man to be killed and himself drove away by 
a back now declared that he would not the fall 
of moscow and now wrote french verses in his in 
the affair man did not understand the meaning of what 
was but merely wanted to do something himself that would 
people to perform some patriotically and like a child he 
made of the and and burning of moscow tried with 
his hand now to speed and now to stay the 
enormous popular that bore him along with it   
   chapter vi   helene having returned 
with the court from to petersburg found herself in a 
difficult position  in petersburg she had enjoyed the special 
of a grandee who occupied one of the highest in 
the empire in she had formed an with a young 
foreign prince when she returned to petersburg both the and 
the prince were there and both their rights helene was 
by a new problem to her with both without either 
 what would have seemed difficult or even impossible to 
another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to countess 
who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever 
woman had she or tried to herself from her awkward 
position by she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging 
herself guilty but helene like a really great man who 
can do he at once assumed her own position to 
be correct as she sincerely believed it to be and 
that everyone else was to  the first time the 
young allowed himself to reproach her she lifted her beautiful 
head and half turning to him said firmly  just 
like a man and cruel i expected nothing else a 
woman herself for you she and this is her reward 
what right have you to demand an account of my 
and he is a man who has been more than 
a father to me the prince was about to say 
something but helene interrupted him   yes said she 
 may be that he has other for me than 
those of a father but that is not a reason 
for me to my door on him i am not 
a man that i should kindness with know that in 
all that to my intimate i account only to god 
and to my conscience she concluded laying her hand on 
her beautiful fully bosom and looking up to heaven  
 for heaven sake listen to me   me 
and i will be your slave   that impossible 
  won to yourself by marrying me you said 
helene beginning to cry  the prince tried to her 
but helene as if quite said through her tears that 
there was nothing to prevent her marrying that there were 
 were up to that time very few but she 
mentioned napoleon and some other that she had never been 
her husband wife and that she had been   
the law said the prince already   law what 
have they been for if they can arrange that said 
helene  the prince was surprised that so simple an 
idea had not occurred to him and he for advice 
to the of the society of with whom he was 
on intimate terms  a few days later at one 
of those enchanting which helene gave at her country house 
on the stone island the charming monsieur de a man 
no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black 
eyes a a  was to her and in the 
garden by the light of the and to the sound 
of music talked to her for a long time of 
the love of god of of the heart and of 
the the one true in this world and the next 
helene was touched and more than once tears rose to 
her eyes and to those of monsieur de and their 
voices trembled a dance for which her partner came to 
her put an end to her with her future de 
conscience but the next evening monsieur de came to see 
helene when she was alone and after that often came 
again        lay member 
of the society of   one day he took 
the countess to a where she down before the to 
which she was led the enchanting middle frenchman laid his 
hands on her head and as she herself described it 
she felt something like a fresh into her soul it 
was explained to her that this was la grace  
after that a long abbe was brought to her she 
to him and he her from her next day she 
received a box the host which was left at her 
house for her to of a few days later helene 
learned with pleasure that she had now been to the 
true and that in a few days the himself would 
hear of her and would send her a certain  
all that was done around her and to her at 
this time all the attention devoted to her by so 
many clever men and expressed in such pleasant refined and 
the state of she was now in  wore only 
white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her 
pleasure but her pleasure did not cause her for a 
moment to forget her aim and as it always happens 
in of that a stupid person gets the better of 
ones helene realized that the main object of all these 
words and all this trouble was after her to to 
obtain money from her for  to which she received 
with her money that the necessary to free her from 
her husband should be performed in her the aim of 
every was merely to certain while satisfaction to human desires 
and with this aim in one of her with her 
father she on an answer to the question in how 
far was she by her  they were sitting in 
the by a window in the drawing room the of 
flowers came in at the window helene was wearing a 
white dress over her shoulders and bosom the abbe a 
well man with a plump clean a pleasant firm mouth 
and white hands on his knees sat close to helene 
and with a subtle smile on his lips and a 
look of at her beauty occasionally glanced at her face 
as he explained his opinion on the subject helene with 
an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his 
plump clean and every moment expected the conversation to take 
a fresh turn but the abbe though he evidently enjoyed 
the beauty of his companion was in his of the 
matter  the course of the father ran as follows 
 of the of what you were you made a 
of to a man who on his part by entering 
the married state without faith in the of committed an 
act of that lacked the it should have had yet 
in spite of this your was you from it what 
did you commit by so a or a sin a 
sin for you acted without intention if now you married 
again with the object of bearing children your sin might 
be but the question is again a one  but 
suddenly helene who was getting bored said with one of 
her smiles  i think that having the true i 
cannot be by what a laid upon me  the 
of her conscience was at having the case to him 
thus with the of he was delighted at the of 
his progress but could not the of he had  
 us understand one another countess said he with a 
smile and began his daughter      
chapter vii   helene understood that the question was 
very simple and easy from the point of and that 
her were making difficulties only because they were as to 
how the matter would be regarded by the  so 
she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion 
of society she the jealousy of the elderly and told 
him what she had told her other that is she 
put the matter so that the only way for him 
to obtain a right over her was to marry her 
the elderly was at first as much taken by this 
of with a woman whose husband was as the younger 
man had been but helene conviction that it was as 
simple and natural as marrying a had its effect on 
him too had helene herself shown the least sign of 
shame or her cause would certainly have been lost but 
not only did she show no signs of or shame 
on the contrary with good naivete she told her intimate 
friends  these were all petersburg that both the prince 
and the had to her and that she loved both 
and was afraid of either  a immediately spread in 
petersburg not that helene wanted to be from her husband 
 such a report spread many would have so an 
intention but simply that the unfortunate and interesting helene was 
in doubt which of the two men she should marry 
the question was no longer whether this was possible but 
only which was the better match and how the matter 
would be regarded at court there were it is true 
some unable to rise to the height of such a 
question who saw in the a of the of but 
there were not many such and they remained silent while 
the were interested in helene good fortune and in the 
question which match would be the more advantageous whether it 
was right or wrong to while one had a husband 
living they did not discuss for that question had evidently 
been settled by people  than you or me as 
they said and to doubt the of that decision would 
be to one and to live in society  only 
marya dmitrievna akhrosimova who had come to petersburg that summer 
to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to 
express an opinion contrary to the general one meeting helene 
at a ball she stopped her in the middle of 
the room and amid general silence said in her voice 
 of living men have started marrying again perhaps you 
think you have a you have been my dear it 
was thought of long ago it is done in all 
the and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up her 
wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly 
round moved across the room  though people were afraid 
of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in petersburg as a 
and so of what she had said they only noticed 
and repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she 
had used the whole of her remark to lie in 
that word  prince vasili who of late very often 
forgot what he had said and repeated one and the 
same thing a hundred times remarked to his daughter whenever 
he to see her   i have a word 
to say to you and he would lead her aside 
drawing her hand downward  have heard of certain you 
know well my dear child you know how your father 
heart to know that you you have so much but 
my dear child consult only your own heart that is 
all i have to say and concealing his he would 
press his against his daughter and move away  who 
had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man 
and who was one of the friends so brilliant a 
woman as helene always has friends who can never change 
into gave her his of the matter at a small 
and intimate gathering   said helene  always called 
friends of that sort by their and she touched his 
coat sleeve with her white fingers  me as you 
would a sister what i ought to do which of 
the two  wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows 
and pondered with a smile on his lips   
are not taking me you know said he  a 
true friend i have thought and thought again about your 
affair you see if you marry the prince meant the 
younger man he one finger  forever lose the of 
marrying the other and you will the court besides  
know there is some kind of connection but if you 
marry the old count you will make his last days 
happy and as widow of the grand the prince would 
no longer be making a by marrying you and smoothed 
out his forehead   a true friend said helene 
beaming and again touching sleeve  i love them you 
know and don want to distress either of them i 
would give my life for the happiness of them both 
 shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that 
not even he could help in that difficulty   
 that what is called putting things she would like 
to be married to all three at the same time 
thought he        a 
woman    tell me how will your husband 
look at the matter asked his reputation being so well 
that he did not fear to ask so naive a 
question  he agree   he me so said 
helene who for some reason imagined that pierre too loved 
her  will do anything for me  puckered his 
skin in for something witty   you said he 
 helene laughed  among those who to doubt the 
of the was helene mother princess she was continually tormented 
by jealousy of her daughter and now that jealousy concerned 
a subject near to her own heart she could not 
herself to the idea she a russian as to the 
of and during a husband and the told her that 
it was impossible and to her showed her a in 
the which  it seemed to him plainly while the 
husband is  with these which appeared to her she 
drove to her daughter early one morning so as to 
find her alone  having listened to her mother helene 
smiled and ironically   it says plainly  shall 
marry her that is said the old princess   
de vous ma position des  said helene changing from 
russian in which language she always felt that her case 
did not sound quite clear into french which it better 
         mamma 
don talk nonsense you don understand     
 anything in my position i have    
my dear   mamma how is it you don 
understand that the father who has the right to grant 
 just then the lady companion who lived with helene 
came in to announce that his was in the ballroom 
and wished to see her   je le je 
          
tell him i don wish to see him i am 
with      him for not keeping 
his word to me    a  said 
a fair young man with a long face and nose 
as he entered the room      
   there is mercy for every sin  
 the old princess rose respectfully and the young man 
who had entered took no notice of her the princess 
nodded to her daughter and out of the room  
 she is right thought the old princess all her 
dissipated by the appearance of his  is right but 
how is it that we in our youth did not 
know it yet it is so simple she thought as 
she got into her carriage   by the beginning 
of august helene affairs were clearly and she wrote a 
letter to her husband as she imagined loved her very 
much him of her intention to marry and of her 
having embraced the one true faith and asking him to 
carry out all the necessary for a which would be 
explained to him by the of the letter   
and so i god to have you my friend in 
his and powerful keeping friend helene   this letter 
was brought to pierre house when he was on the 
field of      chapter viii  
 toward the end of the battle of pierre having 
run down from a second time made his way through 
a to with a crowd of soldiers reached the and 
seeing blood and hearing and hurried on still in the 
of soldiers  the one thing he now desired with 
his whole soul was to get away quickly from the 
terrible amid which he had lived that day and return 
to ordinary of life and sleep quietly in a room 
in his own bed he felt that only in the 
ordinary of life would he be able to understand himself 
and all he had seen and felt but such ordinary 
of life were nowhere to be found  though and 
did not over the road along which he was going 
still on all sides there was what there had been 
on the field of battle there were still the same 
suffering exhausted and sometimes indifferent faces the same blood the 
same soldiers the same sounds of which though now still 
and besides this there were the air and the dust 
 having gone a of along the road pierre sat 
down by the  had and the of died away 
pierre lay on his elbow for a long time gazing 
at the that moved past him in the he was 
continually that a ball was flying toward him with a 
and then he and sat up he had no idea 
how long he had been there in the middle of 
the night three soldiers having brought some settled down near 
him and began a fire  the soldiers who threw 
glances at pierre got the fire to burn and placed 
an iron on it into which they broke some and 
put a little the pleasant of mingled with the smell 
of smoke pierre sat up and the three soldiers were 
and talking among themselves taking no notice of him  
 who may you be one of them suddenly asked 
pierre evidently meaning what pierre himself had in mind  
you want to eat we give you some food only 
let us know whether you are an man   
i said pierre feeling it necessary to his social position 
as much as possible so as to be nearer to 
the soldiers and better understood by them  rights i 
am a officer but my men are not here i 
came to the battle and have lost them   
now said one of the soldiers  another shook his 
head   you like a little the first asked 
and pierre a after it clean  pierre sat down 
by the fire and began the as they called the 
food in the and he thought it more than any 
food he had ever tasted as he sat bending over 
it helping himself to large and one after another his 
face was lit up by the fire and the soldiers 
looked at him in silence   have you to 
go to tell us said one of them   
  a you     what your 
name     then peter come along with 
us we take you there  in the the soldiers 
walked with pierre to  by the time they got 
near and began the hill into the town the were 
already pierre went on with the soldiers quite forgetting that 
his was at the bottom of the hill and that 
he had already passed it he would not soon have 
remembered this such was his state of had he not 
halfway up the hill upon his who had been to 
look for him in the town and was returning to 
the the recognized pierre in the by his white hat 
  excellency he said  we were beginning to 
despair how is it you are on foot and where 
are you going please   yes said pierre  
the soldiers stopped   you found your said one 
of them  good peter it   peter pierre 
heard the other voices   he said and turned 
with his toward the   ought to give them 
something he thought and felt in his  better not 
said another inner voice  there was not a room 
to be had at the they were all occupied pierre 
went out into the yard and himself up head and 
all lay down in his carriage     
 chapter ix   scarcely had pierre laid his 
head on the before he felt himself falling but suddenly 
almost with the of he heard the of the of 
and and blood and and a feeling of horror and 
of death seized him filled with he opened his eyes 
and lifted his head from under his cloak all was 
in the yard only someone passed through the through the 
and talked to the above pierre head some disturbed by 
the movement he had made in sitting up under the 
dark of the the whole courtyard was by a strong 
smell of delightful to pierre at that moment he could 
see the clear sky between the dark of two  
 god there is no more of that he thought 
up his head again  what a terrible thing is 
fear and how i to it but they they were 
steady and calm all the time to the end thought 
he  they in pierre mind were the soldiers those 
who had been at the those who had given him 
food and those who had before the they those strange 
men he had not known stood out clearly and from 
everyone else   be a just a thought pierre 
as he fell  enter life completely to be by 
what makes them what they are but how off all 
the burden of my outer man there was a time 
when i could have done it i could have run 
away from my father as i wanted to or i 
might have been sent to serve as a after the 
with dolokhov and the memory of the dinner at the 
english club when he had dolokhov flashed through pierre mind 
and then he remembered his benefactor at and now a 
picture of a solemn meeting of the itself to his 
mind it was taking place at the english club and 
someone near and dear to him sat at the end 
of the table  that is he it is my 
benefactor but he died thought pierre  he died and 
i did not know he was how sorry i am 
that he died and how glad i am that he 
is again on one side of the table sat anatole 
dolokhov and others like them  his the to which 
these men belonged was as clearly in his mind as 
the of those he they and he heard those people 
anatole and dolokhov shouting and loudly yet through their shouting 
the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the 
time and the sound of his words was as and 
as the on the but pleasant and comforting pierre did 
not understand what his benefactor was saying but he knew 
 of thoughts were also quite distinct in his that 
he was talking of goodness and the of being what 
they were and they with their simple kind firm faces 
his benefactor on all sides but though they were kindly 
they did not look at pierre and did not know 
him wishing to speak and to attract their attention he 
got up but at that moment his legs grew cold 
and bare  he felt ashamed and with one arm 
covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact 
slipped for a moment as he was his cloak pierre 
opened his eyes and saw the same and yard but 
now they were all lit up and with or  
 is dawn thought pierre  that not what i 
want i want to hear and understand my benefactor words 
again he covered himself up with his cloak but now 
neither the nor his benefactor was there there were only 
thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that someone was uttering 
or that he himself was  afterwards when he recalled 
those thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had 
spoken them though the of that day had evoked them 
he had never it seemed to him been able to 
think and express his thoughts like that when   
endure war is the most difficult of man freedom to 
the law of god the voice had said  is 
to the will of god you cannot escape from him 
and they are simple they do not talk but act 
the spoken word is silver but the is man can 
be of nothing while he death but he who does 
not fear it all if there were no suffering man 
would not know his would not know himself the thing 
 went on thinking or hearing in his is to 
be able in your soul to the meaning of all 
to all he asked himself  not to thoughts cannot 
be but to all these thoughts together is what we 
need yes one must them must them he repeated to 
himself with feeling that these words and they alone expressed 
what he wanted to say and solved the question that 
tormented him   one must it is time to 
  to time to your excellency your excellency some 
voice was repeating  must it is time to  
it was the voice of the trying to him the 
sun shone straight into pierre face he glanced at the 
dirty in the middle of which soldiers were their horses 
at the while were passing out of the pierre turned 
away with and his eyes quickly fell back on the 
carriage seat  i don want that i don want 
to see and understand that i want to understand what 
was itself to me in my one second more and 
i should have understood it all but what am i 
to do but how can i everything and pierre felt 
with horror that the meaning of all he had seen 
and thought in the had been destroyed  the the 
and the told pierre that an officer had come with 
news that the french were already near and that our 
men were leaving it  pierre got up and having 
told them to and him went on foot through the 
town  the were moving on leaving about ten thousand 
behind them there were in the at the of the 
and the were crowded with them in the around that 
were to take some of the away shouts and could 
be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which 
had him to a general he knew and drove with 
him to moscow on the way pierre was told of 
the death of his brother anatole and of that of 
prince andrew      chapter x  
 on the of august pierre reached moscow close to 
the of the city he was met by count adjutant 
  have been looking for you everywhere said the 
adjutant  count wants to see you particularly he asks 
you to come to him at once on a very 
important matter  without going home pierre took a cab 
and drove to see the moscow commander in chief  
count had only that morning returned to town from his 
summer at the anteroom and reception room of his house 
were full of who had been or had come for 
orders and had already seen the count and explained to 
him that it was impossible to defend moscow and that 
it would have to be though this news was being 
from the the heads of the government that moscow would 
soon be in the hands just as count himself knew 
it and to escape responsibility they had all come to 
the to ask how they were to deal with their 
 as pierre was entering the reception room a courier 
from the army came out of private room  in 
answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier 
made a gesture with his hand and passed through the 
room  while waiting in the reception room pierre with 
weary eyes watched the old and young military and civilian 
who were there they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre 
went up to a group of men one of whom 
he knew after greeting pierre they continued their conversation  
 they sent out and brought back again later on 
it will do no but as things are now one 
can answer for anything   you see what he 
writes said another pointing to a he held in his 
hand   another matter that necessary for the people 
said the first   is it asked pierre  
 it a fresh  pierre took it and began 
reading   his serene has passed through in order 
to join up with the moving toward him and has 
taken up a strong position where the will not soon 
attack him forty eight with have been sent him from 
here and his serene says he will defend moscow to 
the last drop of blood and is even ready to 
fight in the do not be upset that the law 
are closed things have to be put in order and 
we will deal with in our own way when the 
time comes i shall want both town and and will 
the cry a day or two but they are not 
wanted yet so i hold my peace an will be 
a hunting not bad but a three will be best 
of all a frenchman is no than a of tomorrow 
after dinner i shall take the of the mother of 
god to the in the catherine hospital where we will 
have some water that will help them to get well 
i too am well now one of my eyes was 
but now i am on the with both   
 military men have told me that it is impossible 
to fight in the town said pierre  that the 
position   of course that what we were saying 
replied the first speaker   what does he mean 
by  of my eyes was but now i am 
on the with both asked pierre   count had 
a replied the adjutant smiling  was very much upset 
when i told him people had come to ask what 
was the matter with him by the by count he 
added suddenly addressing pierre with a smile  heard that 
you have family and that the countess your wife  
 have heard nothing pierre replied  what have you 
heard   well you know people often things i 
only say what i heard   what did you 
hear   they say continued the adjutant with the 
same smile  the countess your wife is preparing to 
go abroad i expect it nonsense   remarked pierre 
looking about him absent  who is that he asked 
indicating a short old man in a clean blue with 
a big snow and eyebrows and a face   
that a that is to say he the perhaps you 
have heard of that affair with the   so 
that is said pierre looking at the firm calm face 
of the old man and any indication of his being 
a traitor   not he himself that the father 
of the fellow who wrote the said the adjutant  
young man is in and i expect it will go 
hard with him  an old wearing a star and 
another official a german wearing a cross round his neck 
approached the speaker   a story you know said 
the adjutant  appeared about two months ago the count 
was of it he gave orders to the matter here 
made the the had passed through exactly hands he asked 
one  whom did you get it  so he 
went to the next one  whom did you get 
it and so on till he reached a half educated 
you know  pet of a said the adjutant smiling 
 asked him  gave it you and the point 
is that we knew whom he had it from he 
could only have had it from the but evidently they 
had come to some understanding he replied  no one 
i made it up myself they and him but he 
stuck to that  made it up myself and so 
it was to the count who sent for the man 
 whom did you get the  wrote it myself 
well you know the count said the adjutant with a 
smile of pride  up just think of the fellow 
lying and    the count wanted him to 
say it was from i understand said pierre   
at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay  had his 
own to answer for without that and that is why 
he has been but the point is that the count 
was much  could you have written it yourself said 
he and he took up the that was lying on 
the table  it is you did not write it 
yourself but it and it because you don even know 
french you fool and what do you think  said 
he  have not read any papers i made it 
up myself  that so you a traitor and i 
have you tried and you be say from whom you 
had it  have seen no papers i made it 
up myself and that was the end of it the 
count had the father but the fellow stuck to it 
he was sent for and to hard i believe now 
the father has come to for him but he a 
good lad you know that sort of son a and 
lady he attended some somewhere and that the devil is 
no match for him that the sort of fellow he 
is his father a here by the stone bridge and 
you know there was a large of god with a 
in one hand and an in the other well he 
took that home with him for a few days and 
what did he do he found some of a  
    chapter xi   in the 
middle of this fresh tale pierre was to the commander 
in chief  when he entered the private room count 
puckering his face was rubbing his forehead and eyes with 
his hand a short man was saying something but when 
pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out   
how do you do great said as soon as the 
short man had left the room  have heard of 
your but that not the point between ourselves mon cher 
do you belong to the he went on severely as 
though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless 
intended to pierre remained silent  am well my friend 
but i am aware that there are and i hope 
that you are not one of those who on pretense 
of mankind wish to russia   i am a 
pierre replied   you see mon cher i expect 
you know that and have been to their proper place 
has been treated in the same way and so have 
others who on the of building up the of have 
tried to the of their you can understand that there 
are reasons for this and that i could not have 
the had he not been a person it has now 
come to my knowledge that you him your carriage for 
his from town and that you have even papers from 
him for safe i like you and don wish you 
any and you are only half my age advise you 
as a father would to all with men of that 
and to leave here as soon as possible   
what did do wrong count asked pierre   is 
for me to know but not for you to ask 
shouted   he is of napoleon it is not 
that he did so said pierre without looking at  
  we are shouted at pierre louder than before 
frowning suddenly  is a and a traitor who will 
be as he said he with the heat with which 
people speak when an  i did not summon you 
to discuss my actions but to give you advice an 
order if you it i beg you to leave the 
town and break off all with such men as and 
i will the nonsense out of anybody probably that he 
was shouting at bezukhov who so far was not guilty 
of anything he added taking pierre hand in a friendly 
manner  are on the of a public and i 
haven time to be polite to everybody who has business 
with me my head is sometimes in a whirl well 
mon cher what are you doing personally   nothing 
answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful 
expression of his face  the count frowned   
word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon 
as you can that all i have to tell you 
happy he who has ears to hear good my dear 
fellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway 
after pierre  it true that the countess has into 
the of the fathers of the society of  pierre 
did not answer and left room more sullen and angry 
than he had ever before shown himself  when he 
reached home it was already getting dark some eight people 
had come to see him that evening the secretary of 
a the colonel of his his his major and they 
all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him 
pierre did not understand and was not interested in any 
of these questions and only answered them in order to 
get rid of these people when left alone at last 
he opened and read his wife letter   the 
soldiers at the prince andrew killed that old man is 
to god suffering is necessary the meaning of all one 
must my wife is getting married one must forget and 
understand and going to his bed he threw himself on 
it without and immediately fell  when he next morning 
the major came to inform him that a special a 
police officer had come from count to know whether count 
bezukhov had left or was leaving the town  a 
persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in 
the drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going 
to see them went to the back porch and out 
through the  from that time till the end of 
the of moscow no one of bezukhov household despite all 
the search they made saw pierre again or knew where 
he was      chapter xii  
 the rostovs remained in moscow till the first of 
that is till the of the into the city  
after petya had joined regiment of and left for where 
that regiment was the countess was seized with the thought 
that both her sons were at the war had both 
gone from under her that today or tomorrow either or 
both of them might be killed like the three sons 
of one of her struck her that summer for the 
first time with cruel she tried to get nicholas back 
and wished to go herself to join petya or to 
get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of 
these possible petya could not return unless his regiment did 
so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on 
active service nicholas was somewhere with the army and had 
not sent a word since his last letter in which 
he had given a account of his meeting with princess 
mary the countess did not sleep at night or when 
she did fall that she saw her sons lying dead 
after many and conversations the count at last means to 
her he got petya transferred from regiment to bezukhov which 
was in near moscow though petya would remain in the 
service this would give the countess the of seeing at 
least one of her sons under her and she to 
arrange matters for her petya so as not to let 
him go again but always get him appointed to places 
where he could not possibly take part in a battle 
as long as nicholas alone was in danger the countess 
imagined that she loved her first more than all her 
other children and even herself for it but when her 
youngest the who had been bad at lessons was always 
breaking things in the house and making himself a to 
everybody that petya with his merry black eyes and fresh 
rosy where soft down was just beginning to show he 
was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were 
somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it his 
mother thought she loved him more much more than all 
her other children the nearer the time came for petya 
to return the more uneasy grew the countess she began 
to think she would never live to see such happiness 
the presence of sonya of her natasha or even of 
her husband her  do i want with them i 
want no one but petya she thought  at the 
end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholas 
he wrote from the of where he had been sent 
to procure but that letter did not set the countess 
at ease knowing that one son was out of danger 
she became the more anxious about petya  though by 
the of august nearly all the rostovs had left moscow 
and though everybody tried to the countess to get away 
as quickly as possible she would not hear of leaving 
before her treasure her adored petya returned on the twenty 
of august he arrived the passionate tenderness with which his 
mother received him did not please the sixteen officer though 
she from him her intention of keeping him under her 
petya guessed her and fearing that he might give way 
to when with her  as he it to himself 
treated her coldly her and during his stay in moscow 
attached himself to natasha for whom he had always had 
a particularly tenderness almost  to the count carelessness nothing 
was ready for their by the twenty of august and 
the that were to come from their and moscow estates 
to their household did not arrive till the  from 
the twenty till the thirty all moscow was in a 
and commotion every day thousands of men at were brought 
in by the and taken to of moscow and thousands 
of the and their out by the other in spite 
of or because of them or of them the and 
most were current in the town some said that no 
one was to be allowed to leave the city others 
on the contrary said that all the had been taken 
out of the and everybody was to be ordered to 
leave some said there had been another battle after at 
which the french had been while others on the contrary 
that the russian army had been destroyed some talked about 
the moscow which by the would go to the three 
hills others whispered that had been to leave that had 
been seized that the were and people on their way 
from moscow and so on but all this was only 
talk in  the of at which it was decided 
to moscow had not yet been held both those who 
went away and those who remained behind felt though they 
did not show it that moscow would certainly be and 
that they ought to get away as quickly as possible 
and save their it was felt that everything would suddenly 
break up and change but up to the first of 
nothing had done so as a who is being led 
to execution knows that he must die immediately but yet 
looks about him and the cap that is on his 
head so moscow continued its life though it knew that 
the time of its was near when the of life 
to which its people were accustomed to would be completely 
upset  during the three days the occupation of moscow 
the whole rostov family was in the head of the 
family count ilya rostov continually drove about the city collecting 
the current from all sides and gave and orders at 
home about the for their  the countess watched the 
things being was dissatisfied with everything was constantly in of 
petya who was always running away from her and was 
of natasha with whom he spent all his time sonya 
alone the practical side of matters by getting things but 
of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent nicholas 
letter in which he mentioned princess mary had in her 
presence joyous from the countess who saw an of in 
this meeting of the princess and nicholas   was 
never pleased at bolkonski to natasha said the countess  
i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had 
a that it would happen what a good thing it 
would be  sonya felt that this was true that 
the only of the rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying 
a rich woman and that the princess was a good 
match it was very for her but despite her or 
perhaps just because of it she took on herself all 
the difficult work of the and of their things and 
was busy for whole days the count and countess turned 
to her when they had any orders to give petya 
and natasha on the contrary far from helping their parents 
were generally a and a to everyone almost all day 
long the house with their running feet their and their 
laughter they laughed and were gay not because there was 
any reason to laugh but because gaiety and mirth were 
in their hearts and so everything that happened was a 
cause for gaiety and laughter to them petya was in 
high because having left home a boy he had returned 
 everybody told him a fine young man because he 
was at home because he had left where there was 
no hope of soon taking part in a battle and 
had come to moscow where there was to be in 
a few days and chiefly because natasha whose lead he 
always followed was in high natasha was gay because she 
had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her 
of the cause of her sadness and because she was 
feeling well she was also happy because she had someone 
to her the adoration of others was a the wheels 
of her machine to make them run petya adored her 
above all they were gay because there was a war 
near moscow there would be at the town arms were 
being given out everybody was escaping away somewhere and in 
general something extraordinary was and that is always exciting especially 
to the young      chapter xiii 
  on the thirty of august everything in the 
rostovs house seemed all the doors were open all the 
was being carried out or moved about and the and 
had been taken down there were in the rooms and 
wrapping paper and were about the and house serfs carrying 
out the things were heavily on the the yard was 
crowded with some high and already up others still empty 
 the voices and footsteps of the many and of 
the who had come with the as they shouted to 
one another in the yard and in the house the 
count had been out since morning the countess had a 
brought on by all the noise and and was lying 
down in the new sitting room with a on her 
head petya was not at home he had gone to 
visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a 
from the to the active army sonya was in the 
ballroom looking after the of the glass and china natasha 
was sitting on the floor of her room with dresses 
ribbons and all about her gazing fixedly at the floor 
and holding in her hands the old ball dress  
out of fashion which she had worn at her first 
petersburg ball  natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when 
everyone else was so busy and several times that morning 
had tried to set to work but her heart was 
not in it and she could not and did not 
know how to do anything except with all her heart 
and all her might for a while she had stood 
beside sonya while the china was being and tried to 
help but soon gave it up and went to her 
room to her own things at first she found it 
amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids 
but when that was done and what was left had 
still to be she found it dull   you 
you will won you dear and when willingly promised to 
do it all for her natasha sat down on the 
floor took her old ball dress and fell into a 
quite to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now 
she was roused from her by the talk of the 
maids in the next room  was and by the 
sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch 
natasha got up and looked out of the window an 
long row of full of men had stopped in the 
street  the the old nurse the maids footmen and 
stood at the staring at the  natasha a clean 
handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it 
in each hand went out into the street  the 
former old had stepped out of the crowd by the 
gone up to a with a of and was speaking 
to a pale young officer who lay inside natasha moved 
a few steps forward and stopped still holding her handkerchief 
and listened to what the was saying   you 
have in moscow she was saying  would be more 
comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for the family 
are leaving   don know if it would be 
allowed replied the officer in a weak voice  is 
our officer ask him and he pointed to a stout 
major who was back along the street past the row 
of  natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face 
of the officer and at once went to meet the 
major   the men stay in our house she 
asked  the major raised his hand to his cap 
with a smile   one do you want ma 
said he screwing up his eyes and smiling  natasha 
quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner 
were so serious though she was still holding the of 
her handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some 
if considering in how far the thing was possible in 
the   yes why not they may he said 
 with a slight of her head natasha stepped back 
quickly to who stood talking to the officer   
may he says they may whispered natasha  the in 
which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs yard 
and of with men began at the invitation of the 
to turn into the and to draw up at the 
of the in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to 
be with new people outside the ordinary of her life 
she and tried to get as many of the as 
possible into their yard   papa must be told 
though said   mind never mind what does it 
matter for one day we can move into the drawing 
room they can have all our half of the house 
  now young lady you do take things into 
your head even if we put them into the the 
men room or the nurse room we must ask  
 i ask  natasha ran into the house and 
went on through the half door into the sitting room 
where there was a smell of and   you 
mamma   what sleep said the countess waking up 
just as she was dropping into a   darling 
said natasha by her mother and bringing her face close 
to her mother  am sorry forgive me i never 
do it again i you up has sent me they 
have brought some here will you let them come they 
have nowhere to go i knew you let them come 
she said quickly all in one   officers whom 
have they brought i don understand anything about it said 
the countess  natasha laughed and the countess too smiled 
slightly   knew you give so i tell them 
and having kissed her mother natasha got up and went 
to the door  in the hall she met her 
father who had returned with bad news   stayed 
too long said the count with involuntary vexation  club 
is closed and the police are leaving   is 
it all right some of the into the house said 
natasha   course it is he answered  not 
the point i beg you not to in trifles now 
but to help to and tomorrow we must go go 
go  and the count gave a order to the 
major and the  at dinner petya having returned home 
told them the news he had heard he said the 
people had been getting arms in the and that though 
had said that he would sound a call two or 
three days in the order had certainly already been given 
for everyone to go to the three hills tomorrow and 
that there would be a big battle there  the 
countess looked with timid horror at her son eager face 
as he said this she realized that if she said 
a word about his not going to the battle  
knew he enjoyed the thought of the he would say 
something about men honor and the masculine and which there 
would be no and her would be spoiled and so 
to arrange to leave before then and take petya with 
her as their and she did not answer him but 
after dinner called the count aside and him with tears 
to take her away quickly that very night if possible 
with a woman involuntary she who till then had not 
shown any alarm said that she would die of if 
they did not leave that very night without any pretense 
she was now afraid of everything     
 chapter xiv   madame who had been out

when everything had been taken out of the they and 
it turned out that when the things not worth taking 
had nearly all been the ones really did all go 
into the two only the of the case the would

fell from her eyes but this only a moment she 
at once set to work and they now her completely 
the count was not angry even when they told him

came to her to ask whether a was and whether 
it might be up to natasha directions the work now 
went on unnecessary things were left and the most as 
as possible  but hard as they all worked till 
quite late that night they could not get everything the

man into the house   won object she said 
 but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs 
and so they took him into the and put him 
in the room that had been madame  this man

xv   moscow last day had come it was 
a clear bright day a the everywhere were ringing for 
service just as usual on seemed yet to what the 
city  only two things indicated the social condition of 
moscow that is the poor people and the of an 
enormous crowd of hands house serfs and with whom some 
and were mingled had gone early that morning to the 
three hills having waited there for who did not turn 
up they became convinced that moscow would be and then 
dispersed all about the town to the public and too 
that day indicated the state of affairs the of of 
gold of and horses kept rising but the value of 
paper money and city kept falling so that by there 
were of such as and receiving in a half of 
what they while horses were five hundred rubles each and 
and were being given away for nothing  in the 
rostovs old house the of former of life was but 
little as to the serfs the only indication was that 
three out of their huge during the night but nothing 
was and as to the value of their the thirty 
that had come in from their estates and which many 
people to be and they were offered enormous of money 
for them not only were huge offered for the horses 
and but on the previous evening and early in the 
morning of the first of and sent by officers came 
to the rostovs and men themselves there from the rostovs 
and from where they were the to try to get 
them a lift out of moscow the major to whom 
these entreaties were addressed though he was sorry for the 
refused saying that he not even mention the matter to 
the count pity these men as one might it was 
evident that if they were given one there would be 
no reason to refuse another or all the and one 
own carriages as well thirty could not save all the 
and in the general one could not and one own 
family so thought the major on his behalf  on 
waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his softly 
so as not to the countess who had only toward 
morning and came out to the porch in his silk 
gown in the yard stood the ready the carriages were 
at the front porch the major stood at the porch 
talking to an elderly and to a pale young officer 
with a arm on seeing the count the major made 
a significant and stern gesture to them both to go 
away   is everything ready asked the count and 
stroking his bald head he looked good at the officer 
and the and nodded to them  liked to see 
new faces   can at once your excellency  
 that right as soon as the countess we be 
off god what is it gentlemen he added turning to 
the officer  you staying in my house  the 
officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson  
 be so good as to allow me for god 
sake to get into some corner of one of your 
i have nothing here with me i shall be all 
right on a  before the officer had finished speaking 
the made the same request on behalf of his  
 yes yes yes said the count hastily  shall 
be very pleased very pleased you see to it just 
one or two well what of it do what necessary 
said the count muttering some order  but at the 
same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer 
face had already the order the count looked around him 
in the yard at the at the window of the 
wings officers and their were to be seen they were 
all looking at the count and moving toward the porch 
  step into the gallery your excellency said the 
major  are your orders about the  the count 
went into the house with him repeating his order not 
to refuse the who asked for a lift   
never mind some of the things can be he added 
in a soft confidential voice as though afraid of being 
 at nine o the countess up and who had 
been her lady maid before her and now performed a 
sort of chief duty for her came to say that 
madame was much offended and the young ladies summer dresses 
could not be left behind on inquiry the countess learned 
that madame was offended because her had been taken down 
from its and all the were being and the taken 
out of the to make room for men whom the 
count in the of his heart had ordered that they 
should take with them the countess sent for her husband 
  is this my dear i hear that the 
is being   know love i wanted to tell 
you countess dear an officer came to me to ask 
for a few for the after all ours are things 
that can be but think what being left behind means 
to them really now in our own yard asked them 
in ourselves and there are officers among them you know 
i think my dear let them be taken where the 
 the count spoke timidly as he always did when 
talking of money matters the countess was accustomed to this 
tone as a of news of something to the children 
interests such as the building of a new gallery or 
conservatory the of a private or an she was accustomed 
always to anything announced in that timid tone and considered 
it her duty to do so  she assumed her 
manner and said to her husband  to me count 
you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing 
for the house and now you wish to throw away 
all our the children property you said yourself that we 
have a hundred thousand rubles worth of things in the 
house i don consent my dear i don do as 
you please it the government business to look after the 
they know that look at the opposite they out everything 
two days ago that what other people do it only 
we who are such fools if you have no pity 
on me have some for the children  his arms 
in despair the count left the room without   
what are you doing that for asked natasha who had 
followed him into her mother room   what business 
is it of yours muttered the count angrily   
i heard said natasha  does mamma object   
business is it of yours cried the count  natasha 
stepped up to the window and pondered   here 
berg coming to see us said she looking out of 
the window      chapter xvi  
 berg the rostovs son was already a colonel wearing 
the orders of and anna and he still filled the 
quiet and agreeable post of to the head of the 
staff of the commander of the first of the second 
army  on the first of he had come to 
moscow from the army  he had nothing to do 
in moscow but he had noticed that everyone in the 
army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had 
something to do there so he considered it necessary to 
ask for leave of for family and reasons  berg 
drove up to his father house in his little trap 
with a pair of exactly like those of a certain 
prince he looked attentively at the in the yard and 
while going up to the porch took out a clean 
handkerchief and tied a in it  from the anteroom 
berg ran with though impatient steps into the drawing room 
where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natasha 
and sonya and hastened to after  health   
at a time like this said the count  tell 
us the news is the army or will there be 
another battle   alone can decide the fate of 
our papa said berg  army is burning with a 
spirit of and the so to say have now assembled 
in no one knows what is coming but in general 
i can tell you papa that such a spirit the 
truly of the russian army which they it  himself 
 shown or in the battle of the twenty are 
no words worthy to do it i tell you papa 
 himself on the breast as a general he had 
heard speaking had done but berg did it a late 
for he should have struck his breast at the words 
 army  tell you that we the far from 
having to the men on or anything of that kind 
could hardly restrain those those yes those of he went 
on rapidly  de his life everywhere at the head 
of the i can assure you our corps was on 
a you can imagine  and berg related all that 
he remembered of the he had heard those days natasha 
watched him with an intent that confused him as if 
she were trying to find in his face the answer 
to some question   such as was by the 
russian cannot be imagined or said berg glancing round at 
natasha and as if anxious to her to her intent 
look with a smile  is not in moscow she 
lives in the hearts of her sons isn it so 
papa said he  just then the countess came in 
from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression 
berg hurriedly jumped up kissed her hand asked about her 
health and swaying his head from side to side to 
express sympathy remained standing beside her   mamma i 
tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times 
for every russian but why are you so anxious you 
have still time to get away   can think 
what the are about said the countess turning to her 
husband  have just been told that nothing is ready 
yet somebody after all must see to things one at 
such times there won be any end to it  
the count was about to say something but evidently himself 
he got up from his chair and went to the 
door  at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief 
as if to blow his nose and seeing the in 
it pondered shaking his head sadly and significantly   
i have a great favor to ask of you papa 
said he   said the count and stopped  
 was past house just now said berg with a 
laugh  the a man i know ran out and 
asked me whether i buy something i went in out 
of curiosity you know and there is a small and 
a table you know how dear vera wanted a like 
that and how we had a about it  the 
mention of the and table berg changed his tone to 
one of pleasure at his  it such a beauty 
it out and has a secret english you know and 
dear vera has long wanted one i wish to give 
her a surprise you see i saw so many of 
those in your yard please let me have one i

and   the countess i don give orders  
 it please don said berg  i so wanted 
it for dear vera sake   go to the 
devil all of you to the devil the devil the 
devil cried the old count  head in a whirl 
 and he left the room the countess began to 
cry   mamma yes these are very hard times 
said berg  natasha left the room with her father 
and as if finding it difficult to reach some decision 
first followed him and then ran downstairs  petya was 
in the porch engaged in giving out to the who 
were to leave moscow the were still standing in the 
yard two of them had been and a officer was 
into one of them helped by an   you 
know what it about petya asked natasha  she understood 
that he meant what were their parents about she did 
not answer   because papa wanted to give up 
all the to the said petya  told me i 
consider   consider natasha suddenly almost shouted turning her 
angry face to petya  consider it so horrid so 
so i don know what are we  her quivered 
with and afraid of and letting the force of her 
anger run to she turned and rushed up the stairs 
 berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with 
the attention of a the count pipe in hand was 
pacing up and down the room when natasha her face 
distorted by anger burst in like a and approached her 
mother with steps   horrid it she screamed  
can possibly have ordered it  berg and the countess 
looked at her perplexed and frightened the count stood still 
at the window and listened   it impossible see 
what is going on in the yard she cried  
will be left   the matter with you who 
are  what do you want   the it 
impossible mamma it no mamma darling it not the thing 
please forgive me darling mamma what does it matter what 
we take away only look what is going on in 
the yard mamma it impossible  the count stood by 
the window and listened without turning round suddenly he and 
put his face closer to the window  the countess 
glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame 
for her mother saw her agitation and understood why her 
husband did not turn to look at her now and 
she glanced round quite disconcerted   do as you 
like am i anyone she said not at once  
 darling forgive me  but the countess pushed her 
daughter away and went up to her husband   
dear you order what is right you know i don 
understand about it said she dropping her eyes   
eggs the eggs are the muttered the count through tears 
of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad 
to hide her look of shame on his breast  
 mamma may i see to it may i asked 
natasha  will still take all the most necessary things 
 the count nodded and natasha at the at which 
she used to run when playing at ran through the 
ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard  
the gathered round natasha but could not believe the strange 
order she brought them until the count himself in his 
wife name the order to give up all the to 
the and take the to the when they understood that 
order the set to work at this new task with 
pleasure and it no longer seemed strange to them but 
on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could 
be done just as a of an hour before it 
had not seemed strange to anyone that the should be 
left behind and the away but that had seemed the 
only thing to do  the whole household as if 
to for not having done it sooner set eagerly to 
work at the new task of placing the in the 
the themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale 
but happy faces round the the news that were to 
be had spread to the from which men began to 
come into the rostovs yard many of the asked them 
not to the but only to let them sit on 
the top of the things but the work of once 
started could not be it seemed not to matter whether 
all or only half the things were left behind full 
of china and that had been so carefully the night 
before now lay about the yard and still they went 
on searching for and finding of this or that and 
letting the have another and yet another   can 
take four more men said the  can have my 
trap or else what is to become of them  
 them have my said the countess  can go 
with me in the carriage  they the and sent 
it to take men from a house two doors off 
the whole household was bright and animated natasha was in 
a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not 
known for a long time   could we this 
onto asked the trying to a on the behind a 
carriage  must keep at least one   in 
it asked natasha   count   it will 
put it away it not wanted  the was full 
of people and there was a doubt as to where 
count peter could sit   the box you sit 
on the box won you petya cried natasha  sonya 
too was busy all this time but the aim of 
her was quite different from natasha she was putting away 
the things that had to be left behind and making 
a list of them as the countess wished and she 
tried to get as much taken away with them as 
possible      chapter xvii   
before two o in the the rostovs four carriages full 
and with the horses stood at the front door one 
by one the with the had moved out of the 
yard  the in which prince andrew was being taken 
sonya attention as it passed the front porch with the 
help of a maid she was arranging a seat for 
the countess in the huge high that stood at the 
entrance   is that she inquired out of the 
carriage window   didn you know miss replied the 
maid  prince he spent the night in our house 
and is going with us   who is it 
what his name   our intended that was bolkonski 
himself they say he is dying replied the maid with 
a sigh  sonya jumped out of the and ran 
to the countess the countess tired out and already dressed 
in shawl and for her was pacing up and down 
the drawing room waiting for the household to for the 
usual silent with closed doors before starting natasha was not 
in the room   said sonya  andrew is 
here he is going with us  the countess opened 
her eyes in dismay and sonya arm glanced around  
 she murmured  at that moment this news had 
only one for both of them they knew their natasha 
and alarm as to what would happen if she heard 
this news all sympathy for the man they both liked 
  does not know yet but he is going 
with us said sonya   say he is dying 
 sonya nodded  the countess put her arms around 
sonya and began to cry   of god are 
past finding out she thought feeling that the hand unseen 
was becoming in all that was now taking place  
 mamma everything is ready what the matter asked natasha 
as with animated face she ran into the room  
 answered the countess  everything is ready let us 
start  and the countess bent over her reticule to 
hide her agitated face sonya embraced natasha and kissed her 
 natasha looked at her inquiringly   is it 
what has happened   no   it something 
very bad for me what is it natasha with her 
quick  sonya and made no reply the count petya 
madame and came into the drawing room and having closed 
the doors they all sat down and remained for some 
moments silently seated without looking at one another  the 
count was the first to rise and with a loud 
sigh himself before the all the others did the same 
then the count embraced and who were to remain in 
moscow and while they caught at his hand and kissed 
his shoulder he their lightly with some affectionate and comforting 
words the countess went into the and there sonya found 
her on her knees before the that had been left 
here and there hanging on the wall  most precious 
ones with which some family was connected were being taken 
with them  in the porch and in the yard 
the men whom petya had with and with tucked inside 
their high and with and were taking leave of those 
remaining behind  as is always the case at a 
much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place 
and for a long time two stood one on each 
side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting 
to help the countess in while maids rushed with and 
from the house to the carriages the the and back 
again   always will forget everything said the countess 
 you know i can sit like that  and 
with teeth without but with an look on her face 
hastily got into the to the seat   those 
said the count swaying his head  the old who 
was the only one the countess to drive her sat 
up high on the box and did not so much 
as glance round at what was going on behind him 
from thirty years experience he knew it would be some 
time yet before the order  off in god name 
would be given him and he knew that even when 
it was said he would be stopped once or twice 
more while they sent back to something that had been 
forgotten and even after that he would again be stopped 
and the countess herself would out of the window and 
beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully 
down the hill he knew all this and therefore waited 
for what would happen with more patience than the horses 
especially the near one the who was the ground and 
his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps 
were and pulled up the door was somebody was sent 
for a case and the countess leaned out and said 
what she had to say then deliberately his hat and 
began crossing himself the postilion and all the other did 
the same  in god name said putting on his 
hat  the postilion started the horses the off pole 
horse tugged at his collar the high and the body 
of the swayed the footman onto the box of the 
moving which as it passed out of the yard onto 
the the other in their turn and the of carriages 
moved up the street in the carriages the and the 
all themselves as they passed the opposite the house those 
who were to remain in moscow walked on either side 
of the seeing the off  had natasha experienced so 
joyful a feeling as now sitting in the carriage beside 
the countess and gazing at the slowly of agitated moscow 
occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked 
back and then forward at the long train of in 
front of them almost at the head of the line 
she could see the raised of prince andrew she did 
not know who was in it but each time she 
looked at the her eyes that she knew it was 
right in front  in from the and came several 
other of to the rostovs and as they passed along 
the street the carriages and formed two rows  as 
they were going round the water natasha who was and 
scrutinizing the people or past suddenly cried out in joyful 
surprise   me mamma sonya look it he  
 who   yes on my word it bezukhov 
said natasha putting her head out of the carriage and 
staring at a tall stout man in a long coat 
who from his manner of and moving was evidently a 
in and who was passing under the of the accompanied 
by a small sallow old man in a coat  
 it really is bezukhov in a coat with a 
queer old boy really said natasha  look   
it not he how can you talk such nonsense  
 screamed natasha  stake my head it he i 
assure you stop stop she cried to the  but 
the could not stop for from the street came more 
and carriages and the rostovs were being shouted at to 
move on and not block the way  in fact 
however though now much farther off than before the rostovs 
all saw pierre someone like him a coat going down 
the street with head bent and a serious face beside 
a small old man who looked like a footman that 
old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage 
window gazing at them and respectfully touching pierre elbow said 
something to him and pointed to the carriage pierre evidently 
in thought could not at first understand him at length 
when he had understood and looked in the direction the 
old man indicated he recognized natasha and following his first 
impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the but having taken 
a steps he seemed to remember something and stopped  
natasha face out of the window beamed with   
come here we have recognized you this is wonderful she 
cried holding out her hand to him  are you 
doing why are you like this  pierre took her 
hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside 
her while the still moved on   is the 
matter count asked the countess in a surprised and tone 
  what why don ask me said pierre and 
looked round at natasha whose radiant happy expression which he 
was conscious without looking at her him with   
you remaining in moscow then  pierre   moscow 
he said in a tone  in moscow good  
 if only i were a man i certainly stay 
with you how splendid said natasha  if you let 
me i stay  pierre glanced at natasha and was 
about to say something but the countess interrupted him  
 were at the battle we heard   i 
was pierre answered  will be another battle tomorrow he 
began but natasha interrupted him   what is the 
matter with you count you are not like yourself  
 don ask me don ask me i don know 
myself tomorrow but no good good he muttered  an 
awful time and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto 
the pavement  natasha continued to out of the window 
for a long time beaming at him with her kindly 
slightly happy smile      chapter xviii 
  for the last two days ever since leaving 
home pierre had been living in the empty house of 
his benefactor this is how it happened  when he 
up on the morning after his return to moscow and 
his interview with count he could not for some time 
make out where he was and what was expected of 
him when he was that among others awaiting him in 
his reception room there was a frenchman who had brought 
a letter from his wife the countess helene he felt 
suddenly by that sense of and to which he was 
to he felt that everything was now at an end 
all was in and to that was right or wrong 
the future held nothing and there was no escape from 
this position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first 
sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair 
then rose went to the door of the reception room 
and through the returned his arms and took up a 
book his major came in a second time to say 
that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the 
countess was very anxious to see him if only for 
a minute and that someone from widow had called to 
ask pierre to take of her husband as she herself 
was leaving for the country   yes in a 
minute wait or no no of course go and say 
i will come pierre replied to the major  but 
as soon as the man had left the room pierre 
took up his hat which was lying on the table 
and went out of his study by the other door 
there was no one in the passage he went along 
the whole length of this passage to the stairs and 
frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands went down 
as far as the first landing the hall porter was 
standing at the front door from the landing where pierre 
stood there was a second staircase leading to the back 
entrance he went down that staircase and out into the 
yard no one had seen him but there were some 
carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of 
the the and the yard porter noticed him and raised 
their to him when he felt he was being looked 
at he behaved like an which its head in a 
in order not to be seen he his head and 
his went down the street  of all the affairs 
awaiting pierre that day the of and papers appeared to 
him the most necessary  he the first cab he 
met and told the to go to the where the 
widow house was  continually turning round to look at 
the rows of that were making their way from all 
sides out of moscow and his body so as not 
to slip out of the old pierre experiencing the joyful 
feeling of a boy escaping from school began to talk 
to his  the man told him that arms were 
being distributed today at the and that tomorrow everyone would 
be sent out the three hills and a great battle 
would be fought there  having reached the pierre found 
the house where he had not been for a long 
time past he went up to the that sallow old 
man pierre had seen at five years before with came 
out in answer to his   home asked pierre 
  to the present state of things has gone 
to the with the children your excellency   will 
come in all the same i have to look through 
the said pierre   so good as to step

house  a tall bald old man with a red 
nose wearing a gown and with on his bare feet

angrily and went away along the passage   was 
a very clever man but has now grown quite as 
your honor said  you step into the study pierre 
nodded  it was up so it has remained but 
gave orders that if anyone should come from you they 
were to have the  pierre went into that gloomy 
study which he had entered with such in his benefactor 
the room and since the death of was now even 
 opened one of the and left the room on 
pierre went round the study approached the in which the 
were kept and took out what had once been one 
of the most important the of of the order this 
was the acts with notes and he sat down at 
the table and having laid the before him opened them 
out closed them finally pushed them away and resting his 
head on his hand into meditation  looked into the 
study several times and saw pierre always sitting in the 
same attitude  more than two hours passed and took 
the liberty of making a slight noise at the door 
to attract his attention but pierre did not hear him 
  the to be your honor   yes 
said pierre himself and rising hurriedly  here he added 
taking by a of his coat and looking down at 
the old man with shining and ecstatic eyes  say

said pierre unexpectedly blushing   your excellency said after 
thinking for a moment  all the rest of that 
day pierre spent alone in his benefactor study and heard 
him pacing from one corner to another and talking to 
himself and he spent the night on a bed made 
up for him there  being a who in his 
time had seen many strange things pierre taking up his 
in the house without surprise and seemed pleased to have 
someone to wait on that same evening even asking himself 
what they were wanted for a coat and cap for 
pierre and promised to get him the next day came 
twice that evening along in his as far as the 
door and stopped and looked at pierre but as soon 
as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his gown around 
him with a and angry look and hurried away it 
was when pierre  the coat which had for him 
and had by was on his way with the old 
man to buy the at the that he met the

kutuzov order to through moscow to the road was at 
night on the first of  the first started at 
once and during the night they slowly and steadily without 
at however those the town at the bridge saw of 
them of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge on 
the opposite side and blocking the and while of were 
bearing down on them from behind and an and alarm 
them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it 
and to the and the boats kutuzov himself had driven 
round by side to the other side of moscow  
by ten o in the morning of the second of 
only the remained in the where they had room the 
main army was on the other side of moscow or 
it  at that very time at ten in the 
morning of the second of napoleon was standing among his 
on the hill looking at the spread out before him 
from the twenty of august to the second of that 
is from the battle of to the of the french 
into moscow during the whole of that agitating week there 
had been the extraordinary weather that always comes as a 
surprise when the sun low and gives more heat than 
in spring when everything so in the rare clear that 
the eyes when the are and by inhaling the air 
when even the are warm and when in those dark 
warm stars startle and us continually by falling from the 
sky  at ten in the morning of the second 
of this weather still held  the brightness of the 
morning was moscow seen from the hill lay spread out 
with her river her and her and she seemed to 
be living her usual life her like stars in the 
 the of the strange city with its peculiar such 
as he had never seen before filled napoleon with the 
rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see 
an form of life that has no knowledge of them 
this city was evidently living with the full force of 
its own life by the signs which even at a 
distance distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon 
from the hill the of life in the town and 
felt as it were the breathing of that great and 
beautiful body  every russian looking at moscow her to 
be a mother every who her even if of her 
as the mother city must feel her feminine character and 
napoleon felt it   la la done il  
said he and he ordered a plan of moscow to 
be spread out before him and d the   
       city of the 
     moscow here it is then 
at last that famous city it was    
  high time    town captured by 
the is like a maid who has lost her honor 
thought he  had said so to at from that 
point of he gazed at the oriental beauty he had 
not seen before it seemed strange to him that his 
long wish which had seemed had at last been realized 
in the clear morning light he gazed now at the 
city and now at the plan considering its and the 
assurance of it agitated and him   could it 
be he thought  is this capital at my feet 
where is alexander now and of what is he thinking 
a strange beautiful and city and a strange and moment 
in what light must i appear to them thought he 
thinking of his  she is the reward for all 
those men he reflected glancing at those near him and 
at the who were approaching and up  word from 
me one movement of my hand and that capital of 
the would but my is always ready to upon the 
i must be and truly great but no it can 
be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought 
 here she is lying at my feet with her 
and and in the but i shall spare her on 
the of and i will great words of and mercy 
it is just this which alexander will feel most i 
know him  seemed to napoleon that the chief of 
what was taking place lay in the between himself and 
alexander  the height of the there is the yes 
will give them just i will them the meaning of 
true i will make of remember their with love i 
will tell the that i did not and do not 
desire war that i have war only against the of 
their court that i love and respect alexander and that 
in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of 
myself and of my people i do not wish to 
the of war to an monarch  i will say 
to them  do not desire war i desire the 
peace and welfare of all my however i know their 
presence will me and i shall speak to them as 
i always do clearly and but can it be true 
that i am in moscow yes there she lies  
  said he to his     
    the to me   a 
general with a brilliant off at once to the  
two hours passed napoleon had and was again standing in 
the same place on the hill awaiting the his speech 
to the had already taken definite shape in his that 
speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood 
it  he was himself carried away by the tone 
of magnanimity he intended to toward moscow in his he 
appointed days for at the of the at which russian 
and his own would he mentally appointed a one who 
would the hearts of the people having learned that there 
were many in moscow he mentally decided that he would 
favors on them all he thought that as in africa 
he had to put on a and sit in a 
so in moscow he must be like the and in 
order finally to touch the hearts of the russians being 
like all unable to imagine anything without a reference to 
ma chere ma ma mere   decided that he 
would place an on all these in large  is 
to my dear mother or no it should be simply 
de ma mere  he concluded  am i really 
in moscow yes here it lies before me but why 
is the from the city so long in he wondered 
         dear 
my tender my poor mother      
    of my mother   meanwhile 
an agitated was being carried on in among his and 
at the of his those sent to the had returned 
with the news that moscow was empty that everyone had 
left it the faces of those who were not together 
were pale and they were not alarmed by the fact 
that moscow had been by its  as that fact 
seemed but by the question how to tell the emperor 
putting him in the terrible position of he had been 
awaiting the so long in vain that there were drunken 
left in moscow but no one else some said that 
a of some sort must be scraped together others that 
opinion and that the emperor should first be carefully and 
prepared and then told the truth   will have 
to be told all the same said some gentlemen of 
the  gentlemen  the position was the more awkward 
because the emperor upon his was pacing up and down 
before the map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow 
from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud 
smile   it impossible declared the gentlemen of the 
shrugging their shoulders but not to utter the word  
at last the emperor tired of his actor suggesting to 
him that the moment having been too long drawn out 
was beginning to lose its gave a sign with his 
hand a single report of a followed and the who 
were already spread out on different sides of moscow moved 
into the city through and and with one another they 
moved at the or at a amid the of dust 
they raised and making the air ring with a of 
mingling shouts  drawn on by the movement of his 
napoleon with them as far as the but there again 
stopped and from his horse for a long time by 
the awaiting the      chapter xx 
  meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people 
in it perhaps a part of its former had remained 
but it was empty it was empty in the sense 
that a dying is empty  in a no life 
is left though to a glance it seems as much 
as other  the bees circle round a in the 
hot of the sun as gaily as around the living 
from a distance it of like the others and bees 
fly in and out in the same way but one 
has only to observe that to that there is no 
longer any life in it the bees do not fly 
in the same way the smell and the sound that 
meet the are not the same to the on the 
wall of the instead of the former instant of tens 
of thousands of bees with their threateningly compressed and by 
the of their wings an living sound the only reply 
is a from different of the deserted from the board 
instead of the former smell of and and the warm 
of crowded life comes an of and mingling with the 
smell of there are no longer the alarm with their 
raised and ready to die in defense of the there 
is no longer the measured quiet sound of like the 
sound of water but sounds of in and out of 
the long black bees with fly timidly and they do 
not but away from danger only bees with into the 
and they out empty now they fly out the the 
lower part of the and in instead of black glossy 
bees by to one another legs and drawing out the 
with a of used to in long down to the 
floor of the bees about separately in directions on the 
floor and of the instead of a neatly floor by 
the bees with the of their wings there is a 
floor with of dying bees scarcely moving their legs and 
dead ones that have not been away  the the 
upper part of the and the instead of rows of 
bees up every in the and keeping the warm he 
the of the but no longer in their former state 
of all is and black bees are swiftly and about 
the and the short home bees and listless as if 
they were old slowly about without trying to the having 
lost all motive and all sense of life and awkwardly 
against the of the in their flight here and there 
among the cells dead and an angry can sometimes be 
heard here and there a of bees by force of 
habit and custom out the cells with their strength away 
a dead or without knowing why they do it in 
another corner two old bees are languidly or themselves or 
one another without themselves knowing whether they do it with 
friendly or intent in a third place a crowd of 
bees one another attack some and fight and it and 
the or killed from above slowly and lightly as a 
feather among the of the the two center to the 
cells in place of the former close dark formed by 
thousands of bees sitting back to back and the high 
of generation he of dull listless and sleepy of bees 
they have almost all died sitting in the they had 
and which is now no more they of and death 
only a few of them still move rise and feebly 
fly to on the hand the spirit to die stinging 
him the rest are dead and fall as lightly as 
fish the the a mark on it and when he 
has time tears out its and it clean  so 
in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary 
uneasy and up and down in front of the awaiting 
what to his mind was a necessary if but of 
the  in corners of moscow there still remained a 
few people moving about following their old and hardly aware 
of what they were doing  when with napoleon was 
that moscow was empty he looked angrily at his turned 
away and silently continued to walk to and fro  
 carriage he said  he took his seat beside 
the aide on duty and drove into the  deserted 
he said to himself  an incredible  he did 
not drive into the town but put up at an 
in the  the de had not come off  
    chapter   the russian were 
passing through moscow from two o at night till two 
in the and bore away with them the and the 
last of the who were leaving  the greatest crush 
during the movement of the took place at the stone 
and  while the into two when passing around the 
were the and the stone a great many soldiers taking 
of the and turned back from the and slipped and 
silently past the of vasili the and under the back 
up the hill to the red square where some told 
them they could easily take things not belonging to them 
of the kind seen at filled all the and of 
the but there were no with voices of ingratiating inviting 
to enter there were no nor the usual crowd of 
female only soldiers in and though without entering the empty 
and silently making their way out through its with and 
their  whom there were but few moved about among 
the soldiers quite they their and them up again and 
themselves carried away with the help of their on the 
square in front of the were the call but the 
of the did not make the soldiers run in the 
direction of the as but made them on the contrary 
run farther away among the soldiers in the and some 
men were to be seen in gray with heads two 
officers one with a scarf over his uniform and on 
a dark horse the other in an and on foot 
stood at the corner of street talking a third officer 
up to them   general orders them all to 
be driven out at once without this is half the 
men have dispersed   are you off to where 
he shouted to three without who holding up the of

the scarf called up a and went with him into 
the some soldiers started running away in a group a 
with red on his near the nose and a calm 
expression on his plump face hurriedly and approached the officer

officer stood perplexed and his face showed   not 
my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one 
of the  from one open came the sound of 
and and just as the officer came up to it 
a man in a gray coat with a head was 
out  this man bent rushed past the and the 
officer the officer on the soldiers who were in the 
but at that moment reached them from the huge crowd 
on the bridge and the officer ran out into the 
square   is it what is it he asked 
but his was already off past vasili the in the 
direction from which the came  the officer his horse 
and after him when he reached the bridge he saw 
two the infantry crossing the bridge several and frightened and 
laughing faces among the beside the a was standing to 
which two horses were four with were pressing close to 
the wheels the was high and at the very top 
beside a child chair with its legs in the air 
sat a woman uttering piercing and desperate he was told 
by his fellow officers that the of the crowd and 
the of the woman were to the fact that general 
coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were 
among the while of the bridge had ordered two to 
be and made a show of at the bridge the 
crowd one another and shouting and desperately had off the 
bridge and the were now moving forward    
  chapter   meanwhile the city itself was 
deserted there was hardly anyone in the the and were 
all closed only here and there round the shouts or 
drunken could be heard drove through the and footsteps were 
heard the povarskaya was quite still and deserted the huge 
courtyard of the rostovs house was with of and with

had stayed in moscow with his had opened the clavichord 
and was on it with one finger the yard porter 
his arms stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror

beginning to the with both hands   fancy answered 
surprised at the on his face in the mirror  
 they heard behind them the voice of who had 
entered silently  he the fat is that what you

threateningly  and get the samovar to for your  
the dust off the clavichord and closed it and with 
a deep sigh left the drawing room and its main 
door  going out into the yard she paused to 
consider where she should go next drink tea in the 
with or into the to put away what still lay 
about  she heard the sound of quick footsteps in 
the quiet street someone stopped at the and the rattled 
as someone tried to open it went to the  
 do you want   count ilya rostov  
 who are you   officer i have to 
see him came the reply in a pleasant well russian 
voice  opened the and an officer of with the 
round face of a rostov entered the yard

the young officer standing in the as if whether to 
enter or not his tongue   how he muttered

meanwhile was attentively and sympathetically the familiar rostov features of 
the young man face his tattered coat and trodden  
 did you want to see the count for she 
asked   well it can be helped said he 
in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on 
the as if to leave  he again paused in 
  see he suddenly said  am a of 
the count and he has been very kind to me 
as you see  glanced with an amused air and 
good smile at his coat and  things are worn 
out and i have no money so i was going 
to ask the count  did not let him finish 
  wait a minute sir one little moment said 
she  and as soon as the officer let go 
of the handle she turned and hurrying away on her 
old legs went through the back yard to the  
while was running to her room the officer walked about 
the yard gazing at his worn with lowered head and 
a faint smile on his lips  a pity i 
uncle what a nice old woman where has she run 
off to and how am i to find the way 
to my regiment which must by now be getting near 
the thought he just then appeared from behind the corner 
of the house with a frightened yet resolute look carrying 
a rolled check in her hand while still a few 
steps from the officer she the and took out of 
it a white twenty and hastily it to him  
 his excellency had been at home as a he 
would of course but as it is  grew and 
confused the officer did not but took the note quietly 
and thanked her   the count had been at 
home went on  be with you sir may god 
you said she as she saw him out  swaying 
his head and smiling as if amused at himself the 
officer ran almost at a through the deserted toward the 
bridge to his regiment  but stood at the closed 
for some time with eyes pensively swaying her head and 
feeling an flow of tenderness and pity for the young 
officer      chapter   from 
an house on the the ground floor of which was 
a came drunken shouts and on round the tables in 
a dirty little room sat some ten hands tipsy and 
with eyes and wide they were all some song or 
other they were and with great effort evidently not because 
they wished to sing but because they wanted to show 
they were drunk and on a one a tall fair 
lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the 
others his face with its fine straight nose would have 
been handsome had it not been for his thin compressed 
lips and dull gloomy fixed eyes evidently possessed by some 
idea he stood over those who were and solemnly and 
above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned 
up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out his 
dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down 
and he always carefully rolled it up again with his 
left hand as if it were most important that the 
white arm he was should be bare in the midst 
of the song were heard and and in the passage 
and porch the tall lad waved his arm   
it he exclaimed  a fight and still rolling up 
his sleeve he went out to the porch  the 
hands followed him these men who under the of the 
tall lad were drinking in the that morning had brought 
the some from the and for this had had drink 
served them the from a hearing the sounds of in 
the and it to have been broken into wished to 
force their way in too and a fight in the 
porch had  the was one of the at the 
door and when the came out the himself free from 
the fell face downward on the pavement  another tried 
to enter the doorway pressing against the with his chest 
 the lad with the turned sleeve gave the a 
blow in the face and cried  us  at 
that moment the first got up and his face to 
make it shouted in a tearful voice  murder they 
killed a man   gracious me a man to 
death screamed a woman coming out of a close by 
 a crowd gathered round the   you people 
enough their last said a voice addressing the  have 
you killed a man for you  the tall lad 
standing in the porch turned his eyes from the to 
the and back again as if considering whom he ought 
to fight now   he shouted suddenly to the 
 him   daresay you would like to me 
shouted the pushing away the men on him and snatching 
his cap from his head he it on the ground 
 as if this had some and menacing the the 
paused in   know the law very well i 
take the matter to the captain of police you think 
i won get to him robbery is not to anybody 
now a days shouted the picking up his cap  
 along then come along then the and the tall 
young fellow repeated one after the other and they moved 
up the street together  the went beside them the 
hands and others followed behind talking and shouting  at 
the corner of the opposite a large house with closed 
and bearing a stood a score of thin worn gloomy 
wearing and long tattered   should pay off properly 
a thin with frowning brows and a was saying  
 he our blood and now he thinks he of 
us he been us all the week and now that 
he brought us to this pass he made off  
on seeing the crowd and the man the ceased speaking 
and with eager curiosity all the joined the moving crowd 
  are all the going   to the 
police of course   say is it true that 
we have been  what did you think look what 
are saying  questions and were heard the taking of 
the crowd dropped behind and returned to his  the 
tall youth not noticing the of his foe waved his 
bare arm and went on talking general attention to himself 
it was around him that the people chiefly crowded expecting 
from him to the questions that occupied all their minds 
  must keep order keep the law that what 
the government is there for am i not right good 
said the tall youth with a scarcely perceptible smile  
thinks there no government how can one do without government 
or else there would be who us   talk 
nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd  they give up 
moscow like this they told you that for fun and 
you believed it there of on the march let him 
in indeed that what the government is for you better 
listen to what people are saying said some of the 
pointing to the tall youth  by the wall of 
china a group of people were gathered round a man 
in a coat who held a paper in his hand 
  they are reading an reading an cried voices 
in the crowd and the people rushed toward the  
the man in the coat was reading the of august 
 when the crowd round him he seemed confused but 
at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed 
his way up to him he began in a rather 
voice to read the from the beginning   tomorrow

the tall fellow with a smile on his lips and 
a frown on his  consult with him to act

these  the last words were read out in the 
midst of complete silence the tall lad his head it 
was evident that no one had understood the last part 
in particular the words  will come back to dinner 
evidently both and audience the people minds were to a 
high pitch and this was too simple and was what 
any one of them might have said and therefore was 
what an from the highest should not say  they 
all stood and silent the tall youth moved his lips 
and swayed from side to side   should ask 
him that he himself  ask him indeed why not 
he explain voices in the of the crowd were suddenly 
heard saying and the general attention turned to the police 
trap which drove into the square attended by two  
the of police who had gone that morning by count 
orders to burn the and had in connection with that 
matter a large sum of money which was at that 
moment in his on seeing a crowd bearing down upon

dashed in of the trap  following the of police 
and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of 
the street   now the and have gone away 
and left us to do they think we dogs voices 
in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently 
     chapter   on the 
evening of the first of after his interview with kutuzov

had not been to attend the of war and because 
kutuzov had paid no attention to his to take part 
in the defense of the city also at the revealed 
to him at the which treated the of the capital 
and its as not merely but quite and matters distressed

was soon after by a courier bringing him a letter 
from kutuzov this letter the count to send police officers 
to the through the town as the army was to 
the road moscow this was not news to he had 
known that moscow would be not merely since his interview 
the previous day with kutuzov on the hill but ever 
since the battle of for all the who came to 
moscow after that battle had said that it was impossible 
to fight another battle and since then the government property 
had been removed every night and half the had left 
the city with own yet all the same this information 
astonished and the count coming as it did in the 
form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov 
and received at night breaking in on his beauty sleep 
 when later on in his count explained his actions 
at this time he says that he was then by 
two important to maintain in moscow and the of the 
if one this aim all actions appear  were the 
the arms and of not removed why were thousands of

what then was count fear for the of moscow in 
 what reason was there for assuming any of an 
in the city the were leaving it and the were 
filling it why should that cause the to  neither 
in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything an ever 
occur when the entered a town more than ten thousand 
people were still in moscow on the first and second 
of and except for a in the courtyard assembled there 
at his nothing happened it is obvious that there would 
have been even less reason to expect a among the 
people if after the battle of when the of moscow 
became certain or at least instead of exciting the people 
by arms and had taken steps to all the the 
and money and had told the plainly that the town 
would be  though he had was a and impulsive 
man who had always moved in the highest and had 
no understanding at all of the people he himself to 
be ever since the into he had in been playing 
the role of of the popular feeling of  heart 
of russia not only did it seem to him  
to all that he the actions of moscow but he 
also thought he their mental attitude by means of his 
and written in a coarse tone which the people in 
their own class and do not understand from those in 
was so pleased with the fine role of of popular 
feeling and had grown so used to it that the 
necessity of that role and moscow without any display took 
him and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from 
under his feet so that he did not know what 
to do though he knew it was coming he did 
not till the last moment believe that moscow would be 
and did not prepare for it the left against his 
wishes if the government were removed this was only done 
on the demand of to whom the count reluctantly he 
was in the role he had for himself as is 
often the case with those with an though he had 
long known that moscow would be he knew it only 
with his he did not believe it in his heart 
and did not himself mentally to this new position of 
affairs  all his and  how far it was 
and had any effect on the people is another question 
had been simply toward in the his own feeling of 
hatred of the french  but when assumed their true 
character when expressing hatred for the french in words when 
it was not even possible to express that hatred by 
a battle when self was of no in relation to 
the one question before moscow when the whole out of 
moscow as one man their and by that all the 
of their feeling then the role by suddenly appeared he 
unexpectedly felt himself weak and alone with no ground to 
stand on  when from his sleep he received that 
cold note from kutuzov he felt the more the more 
he felt himself to all that he had been specially 
put in of the state property which he should have 
removed was still in moscow and it was no longer 
possible to take the whole of it away   
is to for it who has let things come to 
such a pass he  i of course i had 
everything ready i had moscow firmly in hand and this 
is what they have let it come to he thought 
without clearly who the and were but feeling it necessary 
to hate those whoever they might be who were to 
for the and position in which he found himself  
all that night count orders for which people came to 
him from all of moscow those about him had never 
seen the count so and   excellency the of 
the department has sent for from the from the from 
the university from the hospital the has sent asking for 
information what are your orders about the fire from the 
of the from the of the all night long such 
were continually being received by the count  to all 
these he gave and angry indicating that orders from him 
were not now that the whole affair carefully prepared by 
him had now been by somebody and that that somebody 
would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that 
might happen   tell that he said in reply 
to the question from the department  he should remain 
to his now why are you asking silly questions about 
the fire they have horses let them be off to 
and not leave them to the french   excellency 
the of the has come what are your commands  
 commands let them go away that all and let 
the out into the town when command our god evidently 
means these other to be free  in reply to 
an inquiry about the in the count shouted angrily at 
the   you expect me to give you two 
we have not got a release them that all about 
it   excellency there are some political prisoners  
 hasn he been yet shouted  him to me 
     chapter   toward nine 
o in the morning when the were already moving through 
moscow came to the count any more for those who 
were able to get away were going of their own 
accord those who remained behind decided for themselves what they 
must do  the count ordered his carriage that he 
might drive to and sat in his study with hands 
sallow and  in quiet and times it seems to 
every that it is only by his that the whole 
under his rule is kept going and in this consciousness 
of being every finds the chief reward of his and 
while the sea of history remains calm the in his 
holding on with a boat to the ship of the 
people and himself moving naturally that his move the ship 
he is holding on to but as soon as a 
and the sea to and the ship to move such 
a is no longer possible the ship with its own 
enormous motion the boat no longer the moving and suddenly 
the instead of a and a of power an insignificant 
man  felt this and it was this which exasperated 
him  the of police whom the crowd had stopped 
went in to see him at the same time as 
an adjutant who the count that the horses were they 
were both pale and the of police after that he 
had the he had received the count that an immense 
crowd had in the courtyard and wished to see him 
 without saying a word rose and walked hastily to 
his light luxurious drawing room went to the door took 
hold of the handle let it go again and went 
to the window from which he had a better of 
the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in front 
his arm and saying something with a stern look the 
blood stood beside him with a gloomy face a of 
voices was audible through the closed window   my 
carriage ready asked back from the window   is 
your excellency replied the adjutant  went again to the 
door   what do they want he asked the 
of police   excellency they say they have got 
ready to your orders to go against the french and 
they shouted something about but it is a crowd your 
excellency hardly managed to get away from it your excellency 
i to   may go i don need you 
to tell me what to do exclaimed angrily  he 
stood by the door looking at the crowd   
is what they have done with russia this is what 
they have done with me thought he full of an 
that up within him against the someone to whom what 
was might be as often happens with passionate people he 
was by anger but was still an object on which 
to it  is that the of the people he 
thought as he gazed at the crowd  they have 
roused by their folly they want a he thought as 
he looked at the tall lad his arm and this 
thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a 
something on which to his   the carriage ready 
he asked again   your excellency what are your 
orders about he is waiting at the porch said the 
adjutant   exclaimed as if struck by an  
and rapidly opening the door he went out onto the 
the talking instantly ceased and were and all eyes were 
raised to the count   morning said the count 
briskly and loudly  you for coming i come out 
to you in a moment but we must first with 
the villain we must the villain who has the of 
moscow wait for me  and the count stepped as 
briskly back into the room and the door behind him 
 a of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd 
 with all the you see and you said the 
french he show you what law is the were saying 
as if one another for their lack of confidence  
a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of 
the front door gave an order and the formed up 
in line the crowd moved eagerly from the toward the 
porch coming out there with quick angry steps looked hastily 
around as if someone   is he he inquired 
and as he spoke he saw a young man coming 
round the corner of the house between two he had 
a long thin neck and his head that had been 
half was again covered by short hair this young man 
was dressed in a blue coat with that had once 
been and dirty convict over which were pulled his thin 
dirty trodden on his thin weak legs were heavy which 
his movements   said hurriedly turning away his eyes 
from the young man in the coat and pointing to 
the bottom step of the porch  him there  
the young man in his stepped to the spot indicated 
holding away with one finger the coat collar which his 
neck turned his long neck twice this way and that 
and before him his thin hands to work  for 
several while the young man was taking his place on 
the step the silence continued only among the back rows 
of the people who were all pressing toward the one 
spot could and the of feet be heard  while 
waiting for the young man to take his place on 
the step stood frowning and rubbing his face with his 
hand   said he with a ring in his 
voice  man is the by whose doing moscow is 
 the young man in the coat a little stood 
in a attitude his fingers clasped before him his young 
face by the half head down at the count first 
words he raised it slowly and looked up at him 
as if wishing to say something or at least to 
meet his eye but did not look at him a 
in the young man long thin neck like a and 
went blue behind the and suddenly his face flushed  
all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the 
crowd and more by the expression he read on the 
faces there he smiled sadly and timidly and lowering his 
head his feet on the step   has his 
and his country he has gone over to bonaparte he 
alone of all the russians has the russian name he 
has moscow to said in a sharp even voice but 
suddenly he glanced down at who continued to stand in 
the same attitude as if by the sight he raised 
his arm and addressed the people almost shouting   
with him as you think fit i hand him over 
to you  the crowd remained silent and only pressed 
closer and closer to one another to keep one another 
back to breathe in that to be unable to stir 
and to something and terrible was becoming those standing in 
front who had seen and heard what had taken place 
before them all stood with wide open eyes and with 
all their strength and held back the crowd that was 
pushing behind them   him let the traitor and 
not the russian name shouted  him down i command 
it  hearing not so much the words as the 
angry tone of voice the crowd and heaved forward but 
again paused   exclaimed the timid yet voice of 
in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued  
one god is above us both he lifted his head 
and again the thick in his thin neck filled with 
blood and the color rapidly came and went in his 
face  he did not finish what he wished to 
say   him down i command it shouted suddenly 
growing pale like   cried the officer drawing his 
own  another still through the crowd and reaching the 
front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of 
the porch the tall youth with a look on his 
face and and arm stood beside   him the 
officer almost whispered  and one of the soldiers his 
face all at once distorted with struck on the head 
with the side of his saber   cried in 
surprise looking round with a frightened glance as if not 
understanding why this was done to him a of surprise 
and horror ran through the crowd  exclaimed a voice 
 but after the of surprise that had from he 
uttered a cry of and that cry was the of 
human feeling strained to the that had held the crowd 
in check suddenly broke the had and must now be 
the of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry 
of the crowd like the and last that a ship 
that last burst from the and reached the front ranks 
carrying them off their feet and them all the was 
about to his blow with a cry of horror his 
head with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall 
youth against whom he seized his thin neck with his 
hands and fell with him under the feet of the 
pressing crowd  some beat and at others at the 
tall youth and the of those that were being on 
and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad 
only the of the crowd it was a long time 
before the could the youth almost to death and for 
a long time despite the with which the tried to 
end the work that had been those who were and 
at were unable to kill him for the crowd pressed 
from all sides swaying as one with them in the 
center and it impossible for them either to kill him 
or let him go   him with an eh 
traitor he still serves him right torture serves a right 
use the what  only when the ceased to and 
his changed to a long measured death did the crowd 
around his corpse begin rapidly to change places each one 
came up glanced at what had been done and with 
horror reproach and pushed back again   the people 
are like wild how could he be voices in the 
crowd could be heard saying  a young fellow too 
must have been a son what men and they say 
he not the right one how not the right one 
o and there another has been too say he nearly 
done for oh the people they afraid of said the 
same now looking with distress at the dead body with 
its long thin half neck and its face with blood 
and dust  a police officer considering the presence of 
a corpse in his excellency courtyard told the to take 
it away two took it by its distorted legs and 
it along the ground the dust half head with its 
long neck along the ground the crowd back from it 
 at the moment when fell and the crowd closed 
in with and swayed about him suddenly turned pale and 
instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage 
him went with hurried steps and bent head not knowing 
where and why along the passage leading to the rooms 
on the ground floor the count face was white and 
he could not control the of his lower   
way your excellency where are you going this way please 
said a frightened voice behind him  count was unable 
to reply and turning went in the direction indicated at 
the back entrance stood his the of the crowd was 
audible even there he hastily took his seat and told 
the to drive him to his country house in  
when they reached the street and could no longer hear 
the shouts of the the count began to he remembered 
with the agitation and fear he had before his  
is terrible he said to himself in french  are 
like whom nothing but can  one god is above 
us both words suddenly to him and a disagreeable shiver 
ran down his back but this was only a momentary 
feeling and count smiled disdainfully at himself  had other 
duties thought he  people had to be many other 
have perished and are for the public good he began 
thinking of his social duties to his family and to 
the city to him and of himself himself as  
that was himself for the public good but himself as 
the of and of the  i been simply my 
course of would have been quite different but it was 
my duty to my life and dignity as commander in 
chief  lightly swaying on the of his carriage and 
no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd grew 
physically calm and as always happens as soon as he 
became physically his mind reasons why he should be mentally 
too the thought which was not a new one since 
the world began and men have killed one another no 
one has ever committed such a against his fellow man 
without comforting himself with this same idea this idea is 
le public the welfare of other people  to a 
man not swayed by that welfare is never certain but 
he who such a always knows just where that welfare 
lies and now knew it  not only did his 
reason not reproach him for what he had done but 
he even found cause for self in having so to 
himself of a opportunity to a and at the same 
time the   was tried and to death thought 
 the had only to hard  was a traitor 
and a i could not let him go and so 
i have killed two birds with one stone to the 
i gave them a and at the same time a 
 having reached his country house and to give orders 
about the count grew quite  half an hour later 
he was with his fast horses across the field no 
longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was 
to come he was to the bridge where he had 
heard that kutuzov was count was mentally preparing the angry 
and stinging he meant to to kutuzov for his he 
would make that old feel that the responsibility for all 
the that would follow the of the city and the 
of russia  regarded it would fall upon his old 
head planning what he would say to kutuzov turned angrily 
in his and gazed sternly from side to side  
the field was deserted only at the end of it 
in front of the and the could be seen some 
people in white and others like them singly across the 
field shouting and gesticulating  one of these was running 
to cross the path of count carriage and the count 
himself his and his looked with horror and curiosity at 
these and especially at the one running toward them  
swaying from side to side on his long thin legs 
in his gown this was running impetuously his fixed on 
shouting something in a voice and making signs to him 
to stop the solemn gloomy face was thin and with 
its growing in his black with moved near the lower 
  pull up i tell you he cried in 
a piercing voice and again shouted something with emphatic and 
gestures  coming of the he ran beside it  
 have they me have i from the dead they 
me me i shall rise shall rise shall rise they 
have my body the of god will be will i 
it and it he cried raising his voice higher and 
higher  count suddenly grew pale as he had done 
when the crowd closed in on he turned away  
he cried in a voice to his the over the 
ground as fast as the horses could draw it but 
for a long time count still heard the growing in 
the distance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished 
frightened face of  traitor in the coat  as 
that mental picture was already felt that it had cut 
deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he 
felt clearly that the trace of that would not pass 
with time but that the terrible memory would on the 
contrary in his heart ever more and to the end 
of his life he seemed still to hear the sound 
of his own words  him down i command it 
  did i utter those words it was by 
some i said them i need not have said them 
he thought  then nothing would have happened he saw 
the frightened and then face of the who the blow 
the look of silent timid reproach that boy in the 
coat had turned upon him  i did not do 
it for my own sake i was to act that 
way the the traitor the public welfare thought he  
were still crowding at the bridge it was hot kutuzov 
and frowning sat on a by the bridge with his 
in the sand when a dashed up a man in 
a general uniform with in his hat went up to 
kutuzov and said something in french it was count he 
told kutuzov that he had come because moscow the capital 
was no more and only the army remained   
would have been different if your serene had not told 
me that you would not moscow without another battle all 
this would not have happened he said  kutuzov looked 
at as if not what was said to him he 
was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment 
on the face of the man addressing him grew confused 
and became silent kutuzov slightly shook his head and not 
taking his from face muttered softly   i shall 
not give up moscow without a battle  whether kutuzov 
was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those 
words or uttered them knowing them to be meaningless at 
any rate made no reply and hastily left him and 
strange to say the of moscow the proud count took 
up a cossack and went to the bridge where he 
began with shouts to drive on the that the way 
     chapter   toward four 
o in the were entering moscow in front a of 
hussars and behind them the king of himself accompanied by 
a  about the middle of the street near the 
of the of st nicholas to news from the as 
to the condition in which they had found the le 
 around gathered a group of those who had remained 
in moscow they all stared in timid at the strange 
long commander dressed up in and gold   that 
their himself he not bad low voices could be heard 
saying  an up to the group   off 
your cap your these words went from one to another 
in the crowd the addressed an old porter and asked 
if it was far to the the porter listening in 
to the accent and not that the was speaking russian 
did not understand what was being said to him and 
slipped behind the others  approached the and told him 
to ask where the russian army was one of the 
russians understood what was asked and several voices at once 
began answering the a french officer returning from the up 
to and that the of the had been and that 
there was probably an there   said and turning 
to one of the gentlemen in his ordered four light 
to be moved forward to fire at the  the 
at a from the following and up the when they 
reached the end of the street they and drew in 
the square several french officers the placing of the and 
looked at the through field glasses  the in the 
were ringing for and this sound the french they imagined 
it to be a call to arms a few ran 
to the and had been put there and two rang 
out from under the as soon as an officer and 
men began to run toward it a general who was 
standing by the shouted some words of command to the 
officer and the latter ran back again with his men 
 the sound of three more came from the  
one struck a french foot and from behind the came 
the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as 
at a word of command the expression of cheerful on 
the faces of the french general officers and men changed 
to one of determined concentrated for and suffering to all 
of them from the to the least that place was 
not the or street nor the  familiar in moscow 
but a new which would probably prove and all made 
ready for that battle the from the ceased the were 
the the off their and an officer gave the word 
 this was followed by two sounds of one after 
another the rattled against the stone of the and upon 
the and and two of smoke rose over the square 
 a few after the of the reports over the 
stone had died away the french heard a strange sound 
above their head thousands of rose above the and in 
the air and their wings together with that sound came 
a human cry from the and amid the smoke appeared 
the figure of a man in a coat he a 
and took aim at the french  repeated the officer 
once more and the reports of a and of two 
were heard the was again by smoke  nothing more 
behind the and the french infantry soldiers and officers to 
the in the lay three and four dead two men 
in ran away at the foot of the wall toward 
the   that away said the officer pointing to 
the and the and the french soldiers after the threw 
the over the  who these men were knew  
that away was all that was said of them and 
they were thrown over the and removed later on that 
they might not alone a few eloquent lines to their 
memory  had occupied the having themselves with from the 
and   the french some of them were and 
the was of their presence  was that the way 
had been the french entered the and began their in 
the square out of the of the house the soldiers 
threw chairs into the square for and there  other 
passed through the and along the the and others themselves 
along the the and the no of the being found 
anywhere the french were not on the as is usual 
in but lived in it as in a  though 
tattered worn out and to a third of their number 
the french entered moscow in good order it was a 
weary and but still a and menacing army but it 
remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into 
their different as soon as the men of the began 
to among the wealthy and deserted the army was lost 
forever and there came into being something neither nor soldiers 
but what are known as when five later these same 
men left moscow they no longer formed an army they 
were a of each carrying a of which seemed to 
him or the aim of each man when he left 
moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer 
but merely to keep what he had like a which 
its into the neck of a and having seized a 
of will not open its for fear of losing what 
it and therefore the french when they left moscow had 
to because they carried their with them yet to what 
they had was as impossible for them as it is 
for the to open its and let go of its 
ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow not 
a or officer was left men in military and could 
be seen through the laughing and through the rooms in 
and men were busy among the and in the or 
breaking open house and doors in and and with rolled 
sleeves and or amusing or women and children there were 
many such men both in the and there was no 
army  order after order was by the french that 
day forbidding the men to about the town sternly forbidding 
any violence to the or any and a call for 
that very evening but despite all these the men who 
had till then an army all over the wealthy deserted 
city with its and as a of cattle well together 
when crossing a field but gets out of hand and 
at once as soon as it rich so did the 
army all over the wealthy city  no were left 
in moscow and the soldiers water through sand through the 
city in all directions from the into which they had 
first the cavalry on entering a house that had been 
and finding there more than sufficient for their horses went 
on all the same to the next house which seemed 
to them better many of them several their on them 
and and even fought with other for them before they 
had had time to secure the soldiers ran out into 
the to see the city and hearing that everything had 
been rushed to places where were to be had for 
the taking the officers followed to check the soldiers and 
were drawn into doing the same in carriage row carriages 
had been left in the and there to and for 
themselves the few who had remained officers to their to 
secure themselves from being there were of wealth and there 
seemed no end to it all around the occupied by 
the french were other still and where they thought yet 
greater might be found and moscow the army ever deeper 
and deeper when water is on dry ground both the 
dry ground and the water and and in the same 
way the of the army into the rich and deserted 
city in and and the of both the army and 
the wealthy city   the french the fire of 
moscow au de  the russians to the of the 
french in however it was not and could not be 
possible to explain the burning of moscow by making any 
or any group of people for it moscow was because 
it found itself in a position in which any town 
built of wood was to burn quite apart from whether 
it had or had not a hundred and thirty fire 
deserted moscow had to burn as as a of has 
to burn on which continually fall for several days a 
town built of wood where scarcely a day without when 
the house are in and a police force is present 
cannot help burning when its have left it and it 
is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes make of the 
chairs in the square and cook themselves twice a day 
in it is only necessary to in the of any 
and the number of in that immediately how much then 
must the of fire be in an town where foreign 
are  de and the of the french were not 
to in the matter moscow was set on fire by 
the soldiers pipes and and by the carelessness of soldiers 
occupying they did not own even if there was any 
 is very doubtful for no one had any reason 
to burn the any case a and dangerous thing to 
do cannot be regarded as the cause for the same 
thing would have happened without any     
   to   however it might be 
for the french to and for russians to the bonaparte 
or later on to place an in the hands of 
their own people it is impossible not to see that 
there could be no such direct cause of the fire 
for moscow had to burn as every village or house 
must burn which is left by its and in which 
are allowed to live and cook their moscow was by 
its it is true but by those who had it 
and not by those who remained in it moscow when 
occupied by the did not remain like vienna and other 
simply because its it and did not the french with 
and nor bring them the of the city   
   chapter   the of the french 
by moscow as it did only reached the where pierre 
was staying by the evening of the second of  
after the last two days spent in and circumstances pierre 
was in a state on he was completely by one 
thought he did not know how or when this thought 
had taken such of him but he remembered nothing of 
the past understood nothing of the present and all he 
saw and heard appeared to him like a  he 
had left home only to escape the of life that 
him and which in his present condition he was unable 
to he had gone to house on the of the 
and papers only in search of rest from life for 
in his mind the memory of was connected with a 
world of solemn and calm thoughts quite contrary to the 
into which he felt himself being drawn he a quiet 
and in study he really found it when he sat 
with his elbows on the table in the of the 
study calm and significant of the last few days rose 
one after another in his particularly of the battle of 
and of that sense of his own and with the 
truth and strength of the class of men he mentally 
as they when roused him from his the idea occurred 
to him of taking part in the popular defense of 
moscow which he knew was and with that object he 
had asked to get him a coat and a to 
him his intentions of remaining in house and keeping his 
name secret then during the first day spent in and 
 tried several times to his attention on the but 
was unable to do so the idea that had occurred 
to him of the of his name in connection with 
bonaparte more than once itself but the idea that he 
l was to set a to the power of the 
was as yet only one of the fancies that often 
passed through his mind and left no trace behind  
when having the coat merely with the object of taking 
part among the people in the defense of moscow pierre 
had met the rostovs and natasha had said to him 
 you remaining in moscow how splendid the thought flashed 
into his mind that it really would be a good 
thing even if moscow were taken for him to remain 
there and do what he was to do  next 
day with the sole idea of not himself and not 
in any way behind them pierre went to the three 
hills but when he returned to the house convinced that 
moscow would not be he suddenly felt that what before 
had seemed to him merely a had now become absolutely 
necessary and he must remain in moscow concealing his name 
and must meet napoleon and kill him and either or 
put an end to the of all europe it seemed 
to him was solely to napoleon  pierre knew all 
the of the on bonaparte life in  by a 
german student in vienna and knew that the student had 
been and the to which he would his life by 
carrying out his design him still more  two strong 
drew pierre to this purpose the first was a feeling 
of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in of the 
common the same feeling that had him to go to 
on the twenty and to make his way to the 
very thick of the battle and had now him to 
run away from his home and in place of the 
and to which he was accustomed to sleep on a 
hard sofa without and eat the same food as the 
other was that and quite russian feeling of for everything 
conventional artificial and human everything the of men regard as 
the greatest good in the world pierre had first experienced 
this strange and fascinating feeling at the when he had 
suddenly felt that wealth power and life that men so 
and it has any worth has so only by reason 
of the joy with which it can all be  
it was the feeling that a to spend his last 
penny on drink and a drunken man to smash or 
glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will 
cost him all the money he the feeling which causes 
a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point 
of are to test as it were his power and 
strength the of a higher of life  from the 
very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first 
time at the he had been under its influence but 
only now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this 
moment pierre was in his design and prevented from it 
by what he had already done in that direction if 
he were now to leave moscow like everyone else his 
flight from home the coat the and his to the 
rostovs that he would remain in moscow would all become 
not merely meaningless but and and to this pierre was 
very  pierre condition as is always the case to 
his mental state the coarse food the he drank during 
those days the of wine and his dirty linen two 
almost passed on a short sofa without this kept him 
in a state of excitement on  it was two 
o in the the french had already entered moscow pierre 
knew this but instead of he only thought about his 
going over its in his mind in his fancy he 
did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of 
the blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary 
and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own and   alone 
for the sake of all i must do it or 
he thought  i will and then suddenly with or 
but that is all the same  is not i 
but the hand of that thee i shall say thought 
he what he would say when napoleon  then take 
me and me he went on speaking to himself and 
his head with a sad but firm expression  while 
pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking 
to himself in this way the study door opened and 
on the appeared the figure of always so timid before 
but now quite  his gown was unfastened his face 
red and distorted he was obviously drunk on seeing pierre 
he grew confused at first but noticing embarrassment on pierre 
face immediately grew bold and on his thin legs into 
the middle of the room   frightened he said 
in a voice  say i won i say am 
i not right sir  he paused and then suddenly 
seeing the on the table seized it with and ran 
out into the  and the porter who had followed 
stopped him in the and tried to take the from 
him pierre coming out into the looked with pity and 
at the half old man frowning with held on to 
the and screamed evidently with some fancy in his head 
  arms board them no you get it he 
  will do please that will do have the 
goodness sir to let go please sir trying carefully to 
by the elbows back to the door   are 
you bonaparte shouted   not right sir come to 
your room please and rest allow me to have the 
  off base slave touch me not see this 
shouted the  them   hold whispered to the 
porter  they seized by the arms and him to 
the door  the was filled with the sounds of 
a and of a tipsy voice  suddenly a fresh 
sound a piercing feminine from the porch and the cook 
came running into the   them gracious o four 
of them she cried  and the porter let go 
and in the now silent the sound of several hands 
at the front door could be heard    
  chapter   pierre having decided that until 
he had carried out his design he would neither his 
nor his knowledge of french stood at the half door 
of the intending to himself as soon as the french 
entered but the french entered and still pierre did not 
retire curiosity kept him there  there were two of 
them one was an officer tall handsome man other evidently 
a private or an short and thin with and a 
dull expression the officer walked in front on a stick 
and slightly when he had a few steps he stopped 
having apparently decided that these were good turned round to 
the soldiers standing at the entrance and in a loud 
voice of command ordered them to put up the horses 
having done that the officer lifting his elbow with a 
gesture stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat  
 la  said he gaily smiling and looking about 
him         day 
everybody   no one gave any reply   
le  the officer asked      
   you the here   gazed at 
the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look   
said the officer looking down at the little man with 
a condescending and good smile  de nous mon  
added he the scared and silent on the shoulder  
does no one speak french in this he asked again 
in french looking around and meeting pierre eyes pierre moved 
away from the door       
   the french are good    
  fellows what the devil there don let us 
be cross old      fellow  
 again the officer turned to and asked him to 
show him the rooms in the house   not 
here understand me you said trying to his words more 
by them  still smiling the french officer spread out 
his hands before nose that he did not understand him 
either and moved to the door at which pierre was 
standing pierre wished to go away and himself but at 
that moment he saw at the open kitchen door with 
the in his hand with a the frenchman raised his 
and took aim   them the tipsy man trying 
to press the hearing the the officer turned round and 
at the same moment pierre threw himself on the just 
when pierre at and struck up the at last got 
his fingers on the there was a report and all 
were in a cloud of smoke the frenchman turned pale 
and rushed to the door  forgetting his intention of 
concealing his knowledge of french pierre snatching away the and 
it down ran up to the officer and addressed him 
in french   are not he asked   
think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over  i 
have had a escape this time he added pointing to 
the of the wall  is that man said he 
looking sternly at pierre   i am really in 
despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidly quite forgetting 
the part he had intended to play  is an 
unfortunate who did not know what he was doing  
the officer went up to and took him by the 
collar  was standing with lips swaying as if about 
to fall as he leaned against the wall   
you shall pay for this said the frenchman letting go 
of him  french are after but we do not 
he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a 
fine gesture  pierre continued in french to the officer 
not to hold that drunken to account the frenchman listened 
in silence with the same gloomy expression but suddenly turned 
to pierre with a smile for a few he looked 
at him in silence his handsome face assumed a gentle 
expression and he held out his hand   have 
my life you are french said he  for a 
frenchman that was only a frenchman could perform a great 
deed and to save his life life of captain of 
the  light regiment a very great deed  but 
however that and the officer conviction upon it pierre felt 
it necessary to him   am russian he said 
quickly   tell that to others said the officer 
his finger before his nose and smiling  shall tell 
me all about that presently i am delighted to meet 
a well and what are we to do with this 
man he added addressing himself to pierre as to a 
brother  even if pierre were not a frenchman having 
once received that of human he could not it said 
the officer look and tone in reply to his last 
question pierre again explained who was and how just before 
their arrival that drunken had seized the which they had 
not had time to from him and begged the officer 
to let the deed go  the frenchman his chest 
and made a gesture with his arm   have 
my life you are french you ask his i grant 
it you lead that man away said he quickly and 
and taking the arm of pierre whom he had to 
be a frenchman for his life he went with him 
into the room  the soldiers in the yard hearing 
the came into the passage asking what had happened and 
expressed their to the but the officer sternly checked them 
  will be called in when you are wanted 
he said  the soldiers went out again and the 
who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen came 
up to his officer   there is and a 
of in the kitchen said he  i serve them 
up   and some wine answered the captain  
    chapter   when the french 
officer went into the room with pierre the latter again 
thought it his duty to assure him that he was 
not french and wished to go away but the officer 
would not hear of it he was so very polite 
amiable good and grateful to pierre for his life that 
pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down 
with him in the first room they entered to pierre 
that he was not a frenchman the captain evidently not 
understanding how anyone could so an shrugged his shoulders and 
said that if pierre absolutely on passing for a russian 
let it be so but for all that he would 
be forever to pierre by gratitude for his life  
had this man been with the slightest capacity for the 
of others and had he at all understood what pierre 
were the latter would probably have left him but the 
man animated to everything other than himself disarmed pierre  
 frenchman or a russian prince said the officer looking 
at pierre fine though dirty linen and at the ring 
on his finger  my life to you and you 
my friendship a frenchman never either an or a service 
i you my friendship that is all i can say 
 there was so much good nature and  the 
french sense of the word in the officer voice in 
the expression of his face and in his gestures that 
pierre smiling in to the frenchman smile pressed the hand 
held out to him   of the  light 
regiment of the of honor for the affair on the 
of he introduced himself a self smile puckering his lips 
under his mustache  you now be so good as 
to tell me with whom i have the honor of 
conversing so instead of being in the with that in 
my body  pierre replied that he could not tell 
him his name and blushing began to try to a 
name and to say something about his reason for concealing 
it but the frenchman hastily interrupted him   please 
said he  understand your reasons you are an officer 
a superior officer perhaps you have arms against us that 
not my business i you my life that is enough 
for me i am quite at your service you belong 
to the he concluded with a of inquiry in his 
tone pierre bent his head  name if you please 
that is all i ask monsieur pierre you say that 
all i want to know  when the and an 
had been served and a samovar and brought with some 
wine which the french had taken from a russian and 
brought with them pierre to his dinner and himself began 
to eat and quickly like a and man his food 
rapidly with his strong teeth continually his lips and repeating 
his face grew red and was covered with pierre was 
and the dinner with pleasure the brought some hot water 
in a and placed a bottle of in it he 
also brought a bottle of taken from the kitchen for 
them to try that was already known to the french 
and had been given a special name they called it 
de  and spoke well of the de he had 
found in the kitchen but as the captain had the 
wine they had taken while passing through moscow he left 
the to and himself to the bottle of he wrapped 
the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin 
and out wine for himself and for pierre the satisfaction 
of his and the wine the captain still more lively 
and he all through dinner   my dear monsieur 
pierre i you a fine for me from that you 
see i have enough in my body already here is 
one i got at  touched his side  a 
second at showed a on his this which as you 
see does not want to march i got that on 
the at the great battle of la dieu it was 
splendid that of fire was worth seeing it was a 
job you set us there my word you may be 
proud of it and on my honor in spite of 
the cough i caught there i should be ready to 
begin again i pity those who did not see it 
  was there said pierre   really so 
much the better you are certainly the great held out 
well by my pipe continued the frenchman  you made 
us pay dear for it i was at it three 
times as i sit here three times we reached the 
and three times we were thrown back like oh it 
was beautiful monsieur pierre your were splendid by heaven i 
saw them close up their ranks six times in and 
march as if on fine fellows our king of who 
knows what what cried  so you are one of 
us soldiers he added smiling after a momentary pause  
much the better so much the better monsieur pierre terrible 
in battle with the fair  and smiled  what 
the french are monsieur pierre they  the captain was 
so naively and good gay so real and so pleased 
with himself that pierre almost back as he looked merrily 
at him probably the word  turned the captain thoughts 
to the state of moscow   tell me please 
is it true that the women have all left moscow 
what a queer idea what had they to be afraid 
of   not the french ladies leave paris if 
the russians entered it asked pierre   the frenchman 
a merry patting pierre on the shoulder  a thing 
to say he exclaimed  but paris paris   
capital of the world pierre finished his remark for him 
 the captain looked at pierre he had a habit 
of stopping short in the middle of his talk and 
gazing with his laughing kindly eyes   if you 
told me you were russian i should have that you 
were you have that i don know what that and 
having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in 
silence   have been in paris i spent years 
there said pierre   yes one that plainly paris 
a man who doesn know paris is a you can 
tell a two off paris is la the the and 
noticing that his was than what had gone before he 
added quickly  is only one paris in the world 
you have been to paris and have remained russian well 
i don you the less for it  under the 
influence of the wine he had drunk and after the 
days he had spent alone with his thoughts pierre enjoyed 
talking with this cheerful and good man   return 
to your ladies hear they are lovely what a wretched 
idea to go and themselves in the when the french 
army is in moscow what a those girls have your 
now another thing but you people you ought to know 
us better than that we took vienna all the world 
we are feared but we are loved we are nice 
to know and then the emperor he began but pierre 
interrupted him   emperor pierre repeated and his face 
suddenly became sad and  the emperor   emperor 
he is mercy order what the emperor is it is 
i who tell you so i assure you i was 
his eight years ago my father was an emigrant count 
but that man has me he has taken hold of 
me i could not the sight of the and glory 
with which he has covered france when i understood what 
he wanted i saw that he was preparing a bed 
of for us you know i said to myself  
is a monarch and i devoted myself to him so 
there oh yes mon cher he is the greatest man 
of the past or future   he in moscow 
pierre with a guilty look  the frenchman looked at 
his guilty face and smiled   he will make 
his tomorrow he replied and continued his talk  their 
conversation was interrupted by the of several voices at the 
and by who came to say that some hussars had 
come and wanted to put up their horses in the 
yard where the captain horses were this difficulty had chiefly 
because the hussars did not understand what was said to 
them in french  the captain had their senior called 
in and in a stern voice asked him to what 
regiment he belonged who was his officer and by what 
right he allowed himself to that were already occupied the 
german who knew little french answered the two first questions 
by giving the of his regiment and of his officer 
but in reply to the third question which he did 
not understand said broken french into his own german that 
he was the of the regiment and his commander had 
ordered him to all the one after another pierre who 
knew german what the german said to the captain and 
gave the captain reply to the hussar in german when 
he had understood what was said to him the german 
and took his men the captain went out into the 
porch and gave some orders in a loud voice  
when he returned to the room pierre was sitting in 
the same place as before with his head in his 
hands his face expressed suffering he really was suffering at 
that moment when the captain went out and he was 
left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the 
position he was in it was not that moscow had 
been taken or that the happy were in it and 
were patronizing him painful as that was it was not 
that which tormented pierre at the moment he was tormented 
by the consciousness of his own weakness the few glasses 
of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this 
good man had destroyed the mood of concentrated in which 
he had spent the last few days and which was 
essential for the execution of his design the and coat 
were ready napoleon was to enter the town next day 
pierre still considered that it would be a and worthy 
to the but now he felt that he would not 
do it he did not know why but he felt 
a that he would not carry out his intention he 
against the of his weakness but felt that he could 
not it and that his former gloomy frame of mind 
and self had been dispersed like dust by with the 
first man he met  the captain returned to the 
room slightly and a  the frenchman chatter which had 
amused pierre now him the he was his and the 
gesture with which he his mustache all now seemed offensive 
 will go away immediately i won say another word 
to him thought pierre he thought this but still sat 
in the same place a strange feeling of weakness tied 
him to the spot he wished to get up and 
go away but could not do so  the captain 
on the other hand seemed very cheerful he up and 
down the room twice his eyes shone and his mustache 
as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing 
thought   colonel of those is delightful he suddenly 
said  a german but a nice fellow all the 
same but he a german he sat down facing pierre 
 the way you know german then  pierre looked 
at him in silence   is the german for 
   pierre repeated  german for is  
 do you say it the captain asked quickly and 
  pierre repeated   said the captain and 
looked at pierre for some with laughing eyes  are 
first fools don you think so monsieur pierre he concluded 
  let have another bottle of this moscow shall 
we will warm us up another little bottle he called 
out gaily  brought candles and a bottle of wine 
the captain looked at pierre by the and was evidently 
struck by the expression on his companion face with genuine 
distress and sympathy in his face went up to pierre 
and bent over him   now we sad said 
he touching pierre hand  i upset you no really 
have you anything against me he asked pierre  it 
the state of affairs  pierre did not answer but 
looked into the frenchman eyes whose expression of sympathy was 
to him   without speaking of what i you 
i feel friendship for you can i do anything for 
you of me it is for life and death i 
say it with my hand on my heart said he 
striking his chest   you said pierre  the 
captain gazed at him as he had done when he 
learned that  was in german and his face suddenly 
brightened   in that case i drink to our 
friendship he cried gaily filling two glasses with wine  
pierre took one of the glasses and it his too 
again pressed pierre hand and leaned his elbows on the 
table in a attitude   my dear friend he 
began  is fortune who would have said that i 
should be a and a captain of in the service 
of bonaparte as we used to call him yet here 
i am in moscow with him i must tell you 
mon cher he continued in the sad and measured tones 
of a man who to tell a long story  
our name is one of the most in france  
and with a frenchman easy and naive the captain told 
pierre the story of his his childhood youth and and 
all about his relations and his and family affairs  
mere playing of course an important part in the story 
  all that is only life setting the real 
thing is love am i not right monsieur pierre said 
he growing animated  glass  pierre again his glass 
and himself out a third   women women and 
the captain looking with eyes at pierre began talking of 
love and of his love affairs  there were very 
many of these as one could easily believe looking at 
the officer handsome self face and the eager enthusiasm with 
which he spoke of women though all love stories had 
the character which regard as the special and of love 
yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that 
he alone had experienced and known all the of love 
and he described women so that pierre listened to him 
with curiosity  it was plain that l which the 
frenchman was so fond of was not that low and 
simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife 
nor was it the love by himself that he experienced 
for natasha  both these kinds of love the one 
he considered the  of and the other the  
of l which the frenchman in the of his relation 
to the woman and in a of giving the chief 
to the feeling  thus the captain the story of 
his love for a fascinating of thirty and at the 
same time for a charming innocent child of daughter of 
the the of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter 
ending in the mother herself and her daughter in to 
her even now agitated the captain though it was the 
memory of a past then he an in which the 
husband played the part of the and he the role 
of the husband as well as several from his of 
germany where  is called and where the husbands eat 
and the young girls are   finally the latest 
in still fresh in the captain memory and which he 
with gestures and face was of how he had the 
life of a pole  general the of life continually 
occurred in the captain stories and the pole had to 
him his enchanting wife  de while himself entering the 
french service the captain was happy the enchanting lady wished 
to with him but by magnanimity the captain restored the 
wife to the husband saying as he did so  
have your life and i save your honor having repeated 
these words the captain his eyes and gave himself a 
as if away the weakness which him at this touching 
 listening to the captain pierre often happens late in 
the evening and under the influence of wine all that 
was told him understood it all and at the same 
time followed a train of which he knew not why 
suddenly in his mind while listening to these love stories 
his own love for natasha unexpectedly rose to his mind 
and going over the of that love in his he 
mentally them with listening to the story of the between 
love and duty pierre saw before his eyes every of 
his last meeting with the object of his love at 
the water at the time of that meeting it had 
not produced an effect upon him had not even once 
recalled it but now it seemed to him that that 
meeting had had in it something very important and  
 come here we have recognized you he now seemed 
to hear the words she had uttered and to see 
before him her eyes her smile her and a lock 
of her hair and there seemed to him something pathetic 
and touching in all this  having finished his tale 
about the enchanting lady the captain asked pierre if he 
had ever experienced a impulse to sacrifice himself for love 
and a feeling of of the husband  by this 
question pierre raised his head and felt a need to 
express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to 
explain that he understood love for a women differently he 
said that in all his life he had loved and 
still loved only one woman and that she could never 
be his   said the captain  pierre then 
explained that he had loved this woman from his years 
but that he had not dared to think of her 
because she was too young and because he had been 
an illegitimate son without a name afterwards when he had 
received a name and wealth he dared not think of 
her because he loved her too well placing her far 
above everything in the world and especially therefore above himself 
 when he had reached this point pierre asked the 
captain whether he understood that  the captain made a 
gesture that even if he did not understand it he 
begged pierre to continue   love he muttered  
whether it was the wine he had drunk or an 
impulse of or the thought that this man did not 
and never would know any of those who played a 
part in his story or whether it was all these 
things together something pierre tongue speaking and with a look 
in his shining eyes he told the whole story of 
his life his natasha love for his best friend her 
betrayal of him and all his own simple relations with 
her on by questions he also told what he had 
at first own position and even his name  more 
than anything else in pierre story the captain was by 
the fact that pierre was very rich had two in 
moscow and that he had everything and not left the 
city but remained there concealing his name and  when 
it was late at night they went out together into 
the street the night was warm and light to the 
left of the house on the a fire first of 
those that were beginning in moscow to the right and 
high up in the sky was the of the moon 
and opposite to it that bright which was connected in 
pierre heart with his love at the stood the cook 
and two their laughter and their remarks in two could 
be heard they were looking at the glow seen in 
the town  there was nothing terrible in the one 
small fire in the immense city  gazing at the 
high sky at the moon at the and at the 
glow from the fire pierre experienced a joyful  now 
how good it is what more does one need thought 
he and suddenly his intention he grew and felt so 
faint that he leaned against the to save himself from 
falling  without taking leave of his new friend pierre 
left the with steps and returning to his room lay 
down on the sofa and immediately fell    
  chapter   the glow of the first 
fire that began on the second of was watched from 
the by the and by the with many different  
the rostov party spent the night at fourteen from moscow 
they had started so late on the first of the 
road had been so by and so many things had 
been forgotten for which were sent back that they had 
decided to spend that night at a place three out 
of moscow the next morning they late and were again 
so often that they only got as far as great 
at ten o that evening the rostov family and the 
with them were all distributed in the and of that 
large village the rostovs and and the of the officers 
after to their had supper the horses and came out 
into the  in a lay adjutant with a the 
awful he made him and and his sounded terrible in 
the of the night he had spent the first night 
in the same yard as the rostovs the countess said 
she had been unable to close her eyes on account 
of his and at she moved into a worse simply 
to be farther away from the man  in the 
of the night one of the noticed above the high 
body of a standing before the porch the small glow 
of another fire one glow had long been visible and 
everybody knew that it was little burning on fire by 
  look here there another fire remarked an  
all turned their attention to the glow   they 
told us little had been set on fire by  
 that not it farther away   it must 
be in moscow  two of the went round to 
the other side of the and sat down on its 
steps   more to the left why little is 
over there and this is right on the other side 
 several men joined the first two   how 
it flaring said one  a fire in moscow either 
in the or the  no one replied to this 
remark and for some time they all gazed silently at 
the spreading of the second fire in the distance  
old the count  he was called came up to 
the group and shouted at   are you staring 
at you good the count will be calling and there 
there go and the clothes together   only ran 
out to get some water said   what do 
you think doesn it look as if that glow were 
in moscow remarked one of the footmen  made no 
reply and again for a long time they were all 
silent the glow spread rising and falling farther and farther 
still   have mercy it and dry said another 
voice   look see what it doing now o 
you can even see the flying have mercy on us 
  put it out no fear   to 
put it out who had been silent was heard to 
say his voice was calm and  it is said 
he  moscow the white his voice faltered and he 
gave way to an old man sob  and it 
was as if they had all only waited for this 
to the for them of the glow they were watching 
were heard words of and the sobbing of the count 
old      chapter   the 
returning to the the count that moscow was burning the 
count his gown and went out to look sonya and 
madame who had not yet went out with him only 
natasha and the countess remained in the room petya was 
no longer with the family he had gone on with 
his regiment which was making for  the countess on 
hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natasha 
pale with a fixed look was sitting on the under 
the just where she had sat down on and paid 
no attention to her father words she was listening to 
the of the adjutant three off   how terrible 
said sonya returning from the yard and frightened  believe 
the whole of moscow will burn there an awful glow 
natasha do look you can see it from the window 
she said to her cousin evidently wishing to her mind 
 but natasha looked at her as if not understanding 
what was said to her and again fixed her eyes 
on the corner of the she had been in this 
condition of since the morning when sonya to the surprise 
and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason 
found it necessary to tell natasha of prince andrew wound 
and of his being with their party the countess had 
been so angry with anyone as she was with sonya 
sonya had cried and begged to be and now as 
if trying to for her paid attention to her cousin 
  natasha how it is burning said she  
 burning asked natasha  yes moscow  and as 
if in order not to sonya and to get rid 
of her she turned her face to the window looked 
out in such a way that it was evident that 
she could not see anything and again settled down in 
her former attitude   you didn see it  
 really i did natasha replied in a voice that 
to be left in peace  both the countess and 
sonya understood that naturally neither moscow nor the burning of 
moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to natasha 
 the count returned and lay down behind the the 
countess went up to her daughter and touched her head 
with the back of her hand as she was to 
do when natasha was ill then touched her forehead with 
her lips as if to feel whether she was and 
finally kissed her   are cold you are all 
over you better lie down said the countess   
down all right i will i lie down at once 
said natasha  when natasha had been told that morning 
that prince andrew was seriously and was with their party 
she had at first asked many questions where was he 
going how was he was it serious and could she 
see him but after she had been told that she 
could not see him that he was seriously but that 
his life was not in danger she ceased to ask 
questions or to speak at all evidently what they told 
her and convinced that say what she might she would 
still be told the same all the way she had 
sat in a corner of the with wide open eyes 
and the expression in them which the countess knew so 
well and feared so much and now she sat in 
the same way on the where she had seated herself 
on she was planning something and either deciding or had 
already decided something in her mind the countess knew this 
but what it might be she did not know and 
this alarmed and tormented her   darling lie down 
on my bed  a bed had been made on 
a for the countess only madame and the two girls 
were to sleep on some on the floor   
mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha 
replied and she went to the window and opened it 
through the open window the of the adjutant could be 
heard more distinctly she put her head out into the 
night air and the countess saw her neck shaking with 
and against the window frame natasha knew it was not 
prince andrew who was she knew prince andrew was in 
the same yard as themselves and in a part of 
the across the passage but this dreadful made her sob 
the countess exchanged a look with sonya   down 
darling lie down my pet said the countess softly touching 
natasha shoulders  lie down   yes i lie 
down at once said natasha and began hurriedly at the 
of her  when she had thrown off her dress 
and put on a jacket she sat down with her 
foot under her on the bed that had been made 
up on the floor her thin and rather short of 
hair to the front and began it her long thin 
fingers rapidly and tied up her her head moved from 
side to side from habit but her eyes wide looked 
fixedly before her when her for the night was finished 
she gently onto the spread over the on the side 
the door   you better lie in the middle 
said sonya   stay here muttered natasha  lie 
down she added crossly and her face in the  
the countess madame and sonya hastily and lay down the 
small in front of the was the only light left 
in the room but in the yard there was a 
light from the fire at little a mile and a 
half away and through the night came the noise of 
people shouting at a had set up across the street 
and the adjutant could still be heard  for a 
long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached 
her from inside and outside the room and did not 
move first she heard her mother and sighing and the 
of her bed under her then madame familiar and sonya 
gentle breathing then the countess called to natasha natasha did 
not answer   think she mamma said sonya softly 
 after a short silence the countess spoke again but 
this time no one replied  soon after that natasha 
heard her mother even breathing natasha did not move though 
her little bare foot thrust out from under the was 
growing cold on the bare floor  as if to 
a over everybody a in a in the wall a 
far off and another replied near by the shouting in 
the had died down only the of the adjutant was 
heard natasha sat up   are you mamma she 
whispered  no one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully 
herself and stepped on the cold and dirty floor with 
her bare feet the of the floor from one foot 
to the other she ran like a kitten the few 
steps to the door and the cold door handle  
it seemed to her that something heavy was against all 
the of the room it was her own heart with 
alarm and and with love  she opened the door 
and stepped across the and onto the cold floor of 
the passage the cold she felt her with her bare 
feet she touched a man stepped over him and opened 
the door into the part of the where prince andrew 
lay it was dark in there in the corner on 
a beside a bed on which something was lying stood 
a with a long thick and  from the moment 
she had been told that morning of prince andrew wound 
and his presence there natasha had to see him she 
did not know why she had to she knew the 
meeting would be painful but felt the more convinced that 
it was necessary  all day she had lived only 
in hope of seeing him that night but now that 
the moment had come she was filled with of what 
she might see how was he what was left of 
him was he like that of the adjutant yes he 
was like that in her he was that terrible when 
she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and his 
knees raised under the for his shoulders she imagined a 
horrible body there and stood still in but an impulse 
drew her forward she took one step and then another 
and found herself in the middle of a small room 
another man lying in a corner on the beneath the 
and two others doctor and a on the floor  
the sat up and whispered something kept by the in 
his gazed with wide eyes at this strange of a 
girl in a white jacket and the sleepy frightened  
do you want what the matter made natasha more swiftly 
to what was lying in the corner unlike a man 
as that body looked she must see him she passed 
the the fell from the and she saw prince andrew 
clearly with his arms outside the and such as she 
had always seen him  he was the same as 
ever but the color of his face his eyes turned 
toward her and especially his neck delicate as a child 
revealed by the turn collar of his shirt gave him 
a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never 
seen on him before she went up to him and 
with a youthful movement dropped on her knees  he 
smiled and held out his hand to her   
   chapter   seven days had passed 
since prince andrew found himself in the on the field 
of his state and the of his which were were 
in the doctor opinion sure to carry him off but 
on the day he ate with pleasure a piece of 
with some tea and the doctor noticed that his temperature 
was lower he had consciousness that morning the first night 
after they left moscow had been warm and he had 
remained in the but at the man himself asked to 
be taken out and given some tea the by his 
into the had made him aloud and again lose consciousness 
when he had been placed on his bed he lay 
for a long time with closed eyes then he opened 
them and whispered softly  the tea his such a 
small of life astonished the doctor he felt prince andrew 
and to his surprise and found it had he was 
dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient 
did not die now he would do so a little 
later with greater suffering the red major of prince andrew 
regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken 
along with him having been in the at the battle 
of they were accompanied by a doctor prince andrew his 
and two  they gave prince andrew some tea he 
drank it eagerly looking with eyes at the door in 
front of him as if trying to understand and remember 
something   don want any more is here he 
asked  along the to him   am here 
your excellency   your wound   sir all 
right but how about you  prince andrew again pondered 
as if trying to remember something   one get 
a book he asked   book   i 
haven one  the doctor promised to procure it for 
him and began to ask how he was feeling prince 
andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but and then said 
he wanted a placed under him as he was uncomfortable 
and in great the doctor and lifted the cloak with 
which he was covered and making faces at the smell 
of that came from the wound began that dreadful place 
the doctor was very much about something and made a 
change in the turning the man over so that he 
again and grew and from the he kept asking them 
to get him the book and put it under him 
  trouble would it be to you he said 
 have not got one please get it for me 
and put it under for a moment he in a 
piteous voice  the doctor went into the passage to 
wash his hands   fellows have no conscience said 
he to the who was water over his hands  
just one moment i didn look after you it such 
you know that i wonder how he can bear it 
  the i thought we had put something under 
him said the  the first time prince andrew understood 
where he was and what was the matter with him 
and remembered being and how was when he asked to 
be carried into the after his had stopped at after 
growing confused from while being carried into the he again 
consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled all that 
had happened to him and above all remembered the moment 
at the when at the sight of the sufferings of 
a man he those new thoughts had come to him 
which promised him happiness and those thoughts though now and 
again possessed his soul he remembered that he had now 
a new of happiness and that this happiness had something 
to do with the that was why he asked for 
a copy of them the uncomfortable position in which they 
had put him and turned him over again confused his 
thoughts and when he came to himself a third time 
it was in the complete of the night everybody near 
him was a from across the passage someone was shouting 
and in the street on the table on the and 
on the and a big fly at the head of 
the bed and around the beside him the of which 
was and had itself like a  his mind was 
not in a state a man usually thinks of and 
things but has the power and will to one of 
thoughts or on which to his whole attention a man 
can tear himself away from the reflections to say a 
civil word to someone who comes in and can then 
return again to his own thoughts but prince andrew mind 
was not in a state in that respect all the 
of his mind were more active and than ever but 
they acted apart from his will most thoughts and occupied 
him at times his suddenly began to work with a 
and it had never reached when he was in health 
but suddenly in the midst of its work it would 
turn to some idea and he had not the strength 
to turn it back again   a new happiness 
was revealed to me of which man cannot be he 
thought as he lay in the of the quiet gazing 
fixedly before him with wide open eyes  happiness lying 
material forces outside the material that act on man happiness 
of the soul alone the happiness of every man can 
understand it but to it and it was possible only 
for god but how did god that law and why 
was the son  and suddenly the of these thoughts 
broke off and prince andrew heard  knowing whether it 
was a or a soft voice and repeating  and 
then  and then again  and  once more 
at the same time he felt that above his face 
above the very middle of it some strange was being 
out of slender or to the sound of this whispered 
music he felt that he had to balance carefully  
it was difficult so that this should not but nevertheless 
it kept and again slowly rising to the sound of 
whispered music spreading out and said prince andrew to himself 
while listening to this and feeling the of this drawing 
out and the of this of he also saw by 
a red round the and heard the rustle of the 
and the of the fly that against his and his 
face each time the fly touched his face it gave 
him a burning and yet to his surprise it did 
not the though it against the very region of his 
face where it was rising but besides this there was 
something else of importance it was something white by the 
door of a which also him   perhaps that 
my shirt on the table he thought  that my 
legs and that is the door but why is it 
always and drawing itself out and  and  and 
 that enough please leave off prince andrew someone and 
suddenly thoughts and again to the surface of his mind 
with peculiar and force   he thought again quite 
clearly  not love which for something for some for 
some purpose or for some reason but the love which 
i dying experienced when i saw my and yet loved 
him i experienced that feeling of love which is the 
very of the soul and does not an object now 
again i feel that to love one neighbors to love 
one to love everything to love god in all his 
it is possible to love someone dear to you with 
human love but an can only be loved by love 
that is why i experienced such joy when i felt 
that i loved that man what has become of him 
is he   with human love one may pass 
from love to hatred but love cannot change no neither 
death nor anything else can it it is the very 
of the soul yet how many people have i in 
my life and of them all i loved and none 
as i did her and he to himself natasha not 
as he had done in the past with nothing but 
her which gave him but for the first time to 
himself her soul and he understood her her sufferings shame 
and he now understood for the first time all the 
of his of her the of his with her  
only it were possible for me to see her once 
more just once looking into those eyes to say  
  and and the fly and his attention was 
suddenly carried into another world a world of and in 
which something particular was in that world some was still 
being and did not fall something was still out and 
the with its red was still burning and the same 
lay near the door but besides all this something there 
was a of fresh air and a new white appeared 
standing at the door and that had the pale face 
and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he 
had just been thinking   how this continual is 
thought prince andrew trying to drive that face from his 
but the face remained before him with the force of 
and drew nearer prince andrew wished to return to that 
former world of thought but he could not and drew 
him back into its the soft voice continued its something 
him and out and the strange face was before him 
prince andrew all his strength in an effort to his 
he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing 
in his ears a in his eyes and like a 
man into water he lost consciousness when he came to 
himself natasha that same living natasha whom of all people 
he most to love with this new love that had 
been revealed to him was before him he realized that 
it was the real living natasha and he was not 
surprised but quietly happy natasha on her knees  was 
unable to stir with frightened eyes on him was restraining 
her her face was pale and only in the lower 
part of it something quivered  prince andrew with relief 
smiled and held out his hand   he said 
  with a but movement natasha drew nearer to 
him on her knees and taking his hand carefully bent 
her face over it and began kissing it just touching 
it lightly with her lips   me she whispered 
raising her head and glancing at him  me  
 love you said prince andrew     
what he asked   me for what i do 
faltered natasha in a scarcely audible broken whisper and began 
kissing his hand more rapidly just touching it with her 
lips   love you more better than before said 
prince andrew lifting her face with his hand so as 
to look into her eyes  those eyes filled with 
happy tears gazed at him timidly and with joyous love 
natasha thin pale face with its lips was more than 
plain was dreadful but prince andrew did not see that 
he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they heard 
the sound of voices behind them  peter the who 
was now wide had roused the doctor who had not 
at all because of the in his had long been 
watching all that was going on carefully his bare body 
with the as he up on his   this 
said the doctor rising from his bed  go away 
 at that moment a maid sent by the countess 
who had noticed her daughter at the door  like 
a from her sleep natasha went out of the room 
and returning to her fell sobbing on her bed  
 from that time during all the rest of the 
rostovs at every place and wherever they spent a night 
natasha never left the bolkonski and the doctor had to 
admit that he had not expected from a young girl 
either such or such in a man  dreadful as 
the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die 
in her daughter arms during the by what the doctor 
said it seemed might easily happen could not natasha though 
with the now between the man and natasha the thought 
occurred that should he their former would be no one 
of all natasha and prince andrew of this the question 
of life and death which not only over bolkonski but 
over all russia out all other     
 chapter   on the third of pierre late 
his head was the clothes in which he had without 
felt uncomfortable on his body and his mind had a 
consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before 
that something shameful was his yesterday conversation with captain  
it was by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark 
out of doors pierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing 
the with an engraved which had replaced on the table 
he remembered where he was and what lay before him 
that very day   i not too late he 
thought  probably he won make his into moscow before 
 pierre did not allow himself to on what lay 
before him but hastened to act  after arranging his 
clothes he took the and was about to go out 
but it then occurred to him for the first time 
that he certainly could not carry the in his hand 
through the it was difficult to hide such a big 
even under his wide coat he could not carry it 
in his or under his arm besides it had been 
and he had not had time to it  matter 
will do he said to himself though when planning his 
design he had more than once come to the that 
the chief mistake made by the student in  had 
been to try to kill napoleon with a but as 
his chief aim not in carrying out his design but 
in to himself that he would not his intention and 
was doing all he could to it pierre hastily took 
the in a green which he had at the with 
the and hid it under his waistcoat  having tied 
a over his coat and pulled his cap low on 
his head pierre went down the trying to avoid making 
a noise or meeting the captain and passed out into 
the street  the at which he had looked with 
so much indifference the evening before had greatly during the 
night moscow was on fire in several places the in 
carriage row across the river in the and the as 
well as the on the river and the by the 
bridge were all  pierre way led through side to 
the and from there to the of st nicholas on 
the where he had long before decided that the deed 
should be done the of most of the were and 
the up the and were deserted the air was full 
of smoke and the smell of burning now and then 
he met russians with anxious and timid faces and with 
an air not of the city but of the in 
the middle of the both the russians and the french 
looked at pierre with surprise besides his height and and 
the strange look of suffering in his face and whole 
figure the russians stared at pierre because they could not 
make out to what class he could belong the french 
followed him with in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike 
all the other russians who gazed at the french with 
fear and curiosity paid no attention to them at the 
of one house three who were explaining something to some 
russians who did not understand them stopped pierre asking if 
he did not know french  pierre shook his head 
and went on in another side street a standing beside 
a green shouted at him but only when the was 
threateningly repeated and he heard the of the man as 
he raised it did pierre understand that he had to 
pass on the other side of the street he heard 
nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him 
he carried his resolution within himself in and like something 
dreadful and to him for after the previous night experience 
he was afraid of losing it but he was not 
to bring his mood to his and even had he 
not been by anything on the way his intention could 
not now have been carried out for napoleon had passed 
the more than four hours on his way from the 
to the and was now sitting in a very gloomy 
frame of mind in a study in the giving and 
orders as to to be taken immediately to the fire 
to prevent and to reassure the but pierre did not 
know this he was entirely in what lay before him 
and was those are who a task that is impossible 
for them not because of its difficulty but because of 
its with their the fear of at the moment and 
so losing his self  though he heard and saw 
nothing around him he found his way by and did 
not go wrong in the side that led to the 
 as pierre approached that street the smoke became and 
even felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly of 
rose from under the of the he met more people 
in the and they were more but pierre though he 
felt that something was around him did not that he 
was approaching the fire as he was going along a 
foot path across a wide space adjoining the on one 
side and the of prince house on the other pierre 
suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to 
him he stopped as if from a and lifted his 
head  by the side of the path on the 
dry grass all sorts of household lay in a a 
samovar and on the ground beside the sat a thin 
woman no longer young with long prominent upper teeth and 
wearing a black cloak and cap this woman swaying to 
and fro and muttering something was with two girls of 
about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short and cloaks 
were staring at their mother with a look of on 
their pale frightened faces the youngest child a boy of 
about seven who wore an and an immense cap evidently 
not his own was crying in his old nurse arms 
a dirty maid was sitting on a and having her 
pale was pulling it straight and at her hair the 
woman husband a short round man in the uniform of 
a civilian official with and showing under his square cap 
the hair smoothly brushed forward over his with face was 
moving the which were placed one on another and was 
some from under them  as soon as she saw 
pierre the woman almost threw herself at his feet  
 people good save me help me dear friends help 
us somebody she muttered between her  girl my daughter 
my youngest daughter is left behind she was it for 
this i you   mary said her husband to 
her in a low voice evidently only to justify himself 
before the stranger  must have taken her or else 
where can she be he added   villain shouted 
the woman angrily suddenly to  have no heart you 
don feel for your own child another man would have 
her from the fire but this is a and neither 
a man nor a father you sir are a noble 
man she went on addressing pierre rapidly between her  
fire broke out and our way the maid called out 
 and we rushed to our things we ran out 
just as we were this is what we have brought 
away the and my bed all the rest is lost 
we seized the children but not o and again she 
began to sob  child my dear one   
where was she left asked pierre  from the expression 
of his animated face the woman saw that this man 
might help her   dear sir she cried him 
by the legs  benefactor set my heart at ease 
go you horrid girl show him the way she cried 
to the maid angrily opening her mouth and still farther 
her long teeth   me the way show me 
i i do it pierre rapidly  the dirty stepped 
from behind the put up her and went on her 
short bare feet along the path pierre felt as if 
he had come back to life after a heavy he 
held his head higher his eyes shone with the light 
of life and with steps he followed the maid overtook 
her and came out on the the whole street was 
full of of black smoke of here and there broke 
through that cloud a great number of people crowded in 
front of the in the middle of the street stood 
a french general saying something to those around him pierre 
accompanied by the maid was to the spot where the 
general stood but the french soldiers stopped him   
 cried a voice       
  can pass    way uncle cried 
the girl  pass through the side street by the 
 pierre turned back giving a spring now and then 
to keep up with her she ran across the street 
turned down a side street to the left and passing 
three turned into a yard on the right   
here close by said she and running across the yard 
opened a in a and stopping pointed out to him 
a small of the house which was burning and one 
of its sides had in another was on fire and 
bright from the of the and from under the  
as pierre passed through the he was by hot air 
and stopped   is it which is your house 
he asked   the girl pointing to the  
it that was our you to death our treasure my 
precious little who at the sight of the fire felt 
that she too must give expression to her  pierre 
rushed to the but the heat was so great that 
he passed round in a and came upon the large 
house that was as yet burning only at one end 
just below the and around which a crowd of at 
first pierre did not what these men who were something 
out were about but seeing before him a frenchman a 
with a saber and trying to take from him a 
coat he understood that was going on there but he 
had no time to on that idea  the sounds 
of and the of falling and the and of the 
the shouts of the people and the sight of the 
swaying smoke now gathering into thick black and now up 
with with here and there of  red and now 
like fish along the and the heat and smoke and 
of motion produced on pierre the usual of a it 
had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the 
sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly from the 
ideas that had him down he felt young bright and 
resolute he ran round to the other side of the 
and was about to into that part of it which 
was still standing when just above his head he heard 
several voices shouting and then a sound and the ring 
of something heavy falling close beside him  pierre looked 
up and saw at a window of the large house 
some who had just thrown out the of a chest 
filled with metal other french soldiers standing below went up 
to the   does this fellow want shouted one 
of them referring to pierre   a child in 
that house haven you seen a child cried pierre  
 he talking about get along said several voices and 
one of the soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might want 
to take from them some of the plate and that 
were in the moved threateningly toward him   child 
shouted a frenchman from above  did hear something in 
the garden perhaps it his that the fellow is looking 
for after all one must be human you know  
 is it where said pierre   there shouted 
the frenchman at the window pointing to the garden at 
the back of the house  a bit coming down 
 and a minute or two later the frenchman a 
black fellow with a spot on his in shirt sleeves 
really did jump out of a window on the ground 
floor and pierre on the shoulder ran with him into 
the garden   up you others he called out 
to his comrades  getting hot  when they reached 
a path behind the house the frenchman pulled pierre by 
the arm and pointed to a round space where a 
three girl in a pink dress was lying under a 
seat   is your child oh a girl so 
much the better said the frenchman  we must be 
human we are all you know and the frenchman with 
the spot on his ran back to his comrades  
with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was 
going to take her in his arms but seeing a 
stranger the child like her mother began to and run 
away pierre however seized her and lifted her in his 
arms she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her 
little hands to pull pierre hands away and to them 
with her mouth pierre was seized by a sense of 
horror and such as he had experienced when touching some 
little animal but he made an effort not to throw 
the child down and ran with her to the large 
house it was now however impossible to get back the 
way he had come the maid was no longer there 
and pierre with a feeling of pity and pressed the 
sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and 
ran with her through the garden another way out  
    chapter   having run through 
different and side pierre got back with his little burden 
to the garden at the corner of the he did 
not at first recognize the place from which he had 
set out to look for the child so crowded was 
it now with people and that had been out of 
the besides russian families who had taken here from the 
fire with their there were several french soldiers in a 
of pierre took no notice of them he hurried to 
find the family of that civil in order to restore 
the daughter to her mother and go to save someone 
else pierre felt that he had still much to do 
and to do quickly with the heat and from running 
he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the 
sense of youth animation and that had come on him 
when he ran to save the child she had now 
become quiet and with her little hands to pierre coat 
sat on his arm gazing about her like some little 
wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with a slight 
smile he he saw something innocent in that frightened little 
face  he did not find the civil or his 
wife where he had left them he walked among the 
crowd with steps the faces he met he noticed a 
or family of a very handsome old man of oriental 
type wearing a new coat and new an old woman 
of type and a young woman that very young woman 
seemed to pierre the perfection of oriental beauty with her 
black eyebrows and the soft bright color of her long 
beautiful face amid the property and the crowd on the 
open space she in her rich cloak with a bright 
shawl on her head suggested a delicate plant thrown out 
onto the snow she was sitting on some a little 
behind the old woman and looked from under her long 
lashes with large eyes at the ground before her evidently 
she was aware of her beauty and because of it 
her face struck pierre and hurrying along by the he 
turned several times to look at her when he had 
reached the still without finding those he he stopped and 
looked about him  with the child in his arms 
his figure was now more than before and a group 
of russians both men and women gathered about him  
 you lost anyone my dear fellow you of the 
yourself you whose child is it they asked him  
pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in 
a black coat who had been sitting there with her 
other children and he asked whether anyone knew where she 
had gone   that must be the said an 
old addressing a woman  have mercy have mercy he 
added in his bass   no said the woman

they went inside the garden when these down said the 
woman pointing to the french soldiers   have mercy 
added the   over that way they there it 
she she kept on and crying continued the woman  
she here this way  but pierre was not listening 
to the woman he had for some been watching what 
was going on a few steps away he was looking 
at the family and at two french soldiers who had 
gone up to them one of these a nimble little 
man was wearing a blue coat tied round the with 
a he had a on his head and his feet 
were bare the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was 
a long round fair man in his movements and with 
an expression of face he wore a woman gown of 
blue and large the little frenchman in the blue coat 
went up to the and saying something immediately seized the 
old man by his legs and the old man at 
once began pulling off his the other in the gown 
stopped in front of the beautiful girl and with his 
hands in his stood staring at her and silent

woman the little girl to her  her back to 
them give her back he almost shouted putting the child 
who began on the ground and again looking at the 
frenchman and the family  the old man was already 
sitting the little frenchman had his second and was slapping 
one against the other the old man was saying something 
in a voice broken by but pierre caught but a 
of this his whole attention was to the frenchman in 
the gown who meanwhile swaying slowly from side to side 
had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his 
hands from his had seized her by the neck  
the beautiful still sat and in the same attitude with 
her long lashes drooping as if she did not see 
or feel what the was doing to her  while 
pierre was running the few steps that him from the 
frenchman the tall in the gown was already from her 
neck the necklace the young was wearing and the young 
woman at her neck screamed   that woman alone 
exclaimed pierre in a voice the by his round shoulders 
and him aside  the fell got up and ran 
away but his down the and drawing his sword moved 
threateningly toward pierre   de  he cried  
       here no nonsense 
  pierre was in such a of that he 
remembered nothing and his strength he rushed at the frenchman 
and before the latter had time to draw his sword 
him off his feet and him with his shouts of 
approval were heard from the crowd around and at the 
same moment a of french appeared from round the corner 
the came up at a to pierre and the frenchman 
and them pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that 
he only remembered someone and being and finally feeling that 
his hands were and that a crowd of french soldiers 
stood around him and were searching him   he 
has a were the first words pierre understood   
a said the officer and turned to the who had 
been with pierre  right you can tell all about 
it at the court then he turned to pierre  
you speak french  pierre looked around him with eyes 
and did not reply his face probably looked very terrible 
for the officer said something in a whisper and four 
more left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides 
of pierre   you speak french the officer asked 
again keeping at a distance from pierre  the  
a little man in russian civilian clothes out from the 
ranks and by his clothes and manner of speaking pierre 
at once knew him to be a french from one 
of the moscow   does not look like a 
common man said the after a searching look at pierre 
  he looks very much like an remarked the 
officer  ask him who he is he added

french   ah muttered the officer with a frown 
 then march  a crowd had round the to 
pierre stood the woman with the little girl and when 
the started she moved forward   are they taking

girl the little girl what am i to do with

if his at the sight of the little girl he 
had   does she want he murmured  is

said he  and without knowing how this lie had 
him he went along with resolute and steps between the 
french soldiers  the french was one of those sent 
out through the of moscow by order to put a 
stop to the and especially to catch the who to 
the general opinion which had that day among the higher 
french officers were the cause of the after through a 
number of the five more russian a small two students 
a and a house besides several but of all these 
suspected pierre was considered to be the most of all 
when they had all been brought for the night to 
a large house on the that was being used as 
a pierre was placed apart under     
 book twelve       chapter 
i   in petersburg at that time a was 
being carried on with greater heat than ever in the 
highest between the parties of rumyantsev the french marya fedorovna 
the and others drowned as usual by the of the 
court but the calm luxurious life of petersburg concerned only 
about and reflections of real life went on in its 
old way and made it hard except by a great 
effort to the danger and the difficult position of the 
russian people there were the same receptions and balls the 
same french the same court interests and service interests and 
intrigues as usual only in the very highest were made 
to keep in mind the difficulties of the position stories 
were whispered of how differently the two behaved in these 
difficult circumstances the empress marya concerned for the welfare of 
the and under her had given directions that they should 
all be removed to and the things belonging to these 
had already been up the empress however when asked what 
she would be pleased to give her russian had replied 
that she could give no directions about state for that 
was the affair of the sovereign but as far as 
she personally was concerned she would be the last to 
petersburg  at anna pavlovna on the twenty of august 
the very day of the battle of there was a 
soiree the chief feature of which was to be the 
reading of a letter from his the when sending the 
emperor an of the it was regarded as a model 
of prince vasili himself for his was to read it 
 used to read at the empress the art of 
his reading was to lie in rolling out the words 
quite of their meaning in a loud and voice between 
a wail and a tender so that the wail fell 
quite at random on one word and the on another 
this reading as was always the case at anna pavlovna 
had a political that evening she expected several important who 
had to be made ashamed of their visits to the 
french and to a a good many people had already 
arrived but anna pavlovna not yet seeing all those whom 
she wanted in her drawing room did not let the 
reading begin but wound up the of a general conversation 
 the news of the day in petersburg was the 
illness of countess she had ill unexpectedly a few days 
had several gatherings of which she was usually and was 
said to be receiving no one and instead of the 
celebrated petersburg doctors who usually attended her had herself to 
some italian doctor who was treating her in some new 
and way  they all knew very well that the 
enchanting countess illness from an resulting from marrying two husbands 
at the same time and that the italian in such 
but in anna pavlovna presence no one dared to think 
of this or even appear to know it   
say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says 
it is   oh that a terrible illness  
 say that the rivals are to the and the 
word was repeated with great satisfaction   count is 
pathetic they say he cried like a child when the 
doctor told him the case was dangerous   it 
would be a terrible she is an enchanting woman  
 are speaking of the poor countess said anna pavlovna 
coming up just then  sent to ask for news 
and hear that she is a little better oh she 
is certainly the most charming woman in the world she 
went on with a smile at her own enthusiasm  
belong to different but that does not prevent my her 
as she she is very unfortunate added anna pavlovna  
that by these words anna pavlovna was lifting the from 
the secret of the countess an young man to express 
surprise that well known doctors had not been called in 
and that the countess was being attended by a who 
might dangerous   information maybe better than mine anna 
pavlovna suddenly and on the young man  i know 
on good that this doctor is a very learned and 
able man he is private to the queen of  
and having thus the young man anna pavlovna turned to 
another group where was talking about the having wrinkled up 
his face he was evidently preparing to it out again 
and utter one of his   think it is 
delightful he said referring to a note that had been 
sent to vienna with some captured from the french by 
 hero of as he was then called in petersburg 
  what that asked anna pavlovna silence for the 
which she had heard before  and repeated the words 
of the dispatch which he had himself   emperor 
returns these said  gone and found on a wrong 
path and his became again   charming observed prince 
vasili   path to perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly 
and unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he meant 
prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew 
no more than the others what his words meant during 
his career he had more than once noticed that such 
were received as very witty and at every opportunity he 
uttered in that way the first words that entered his 
head  may turn out very well he thought  
if not they know how to arrange matters and really 
during the awkward silence that ensued that person entered whom 
anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to and 
she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte prince vasili 
to the table and bringing him two candles and the 
begged him to begin everyone became silent    
gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasili sternly looking round at 
his audience as if to whether anyone had anything to 
say to the contrary but no one said anything  
our capital the new her placed a emphasis on the 
word her a mother her sons into her arms and 
through the gathering the brilliant glory of rule in  
is he that   prince vasili these last words 
in a tearful voice  attentively examined his and many 
of those present appeared intimidated as if asking in what 
they were to anna pavlovna whispered the next words in 
like an old woman muttering the at  the bold 
and insolent she whispered  prince vasili continued   
 the bold and insolent from the of france the 
of russia with death faith the of the russian shall 
suddenly his head in his pride this of the the 
of god and of old of our country is offered 
to your imperial majesty i that my strength in the 
sight of your most gracious presence i to heaven that 
the may the race of the just and fulfill the 
desires of your majesty    force what a 
style was uttered in approval both of and of  
animated by that anna pavlovna guests talked for a long 
time of the state of the and offered as to 
the result of the battle to be fought in a 
few days   will see said anna pavlovna  
tomorrow on the emperor we shall receive news i have 
a      chapter ii   
anna pavlovna was in fact next day during the service 
at the in honor of the emperor prince was called 
out of the and received a dispatch from prince kutuzov 
it was kutuzov report written from on the day of 
the battle kutuzov wrote that the russians had not a 
step that the french were much than ours and that 
he was in from the field of battle before collecting 
full information it followed that there must have been a 
and at once without leaving the were to the for 
his help and for the  anna pavlovna was justified 
and all that morning a joyously mood in the city 
everyone believed the to have been complete and some even 
spoke of napoleon having been captured of his and of 
the choice of a new for france  it is 
very difficult for to be reflected in their real strength 
and amid the of court life and far from the 
scene of general group themselves around some particular so now 
the pleasure was as much on the fact that the 
news had arrived on the emperor as on the fact 
of the itself it was like a arranged surprise mention 
was made in kutuzov report of the russian among which 
the of and in the petersburg world this sad side 
of the affair again round a single death everybody knew 
him the emperor liked him and he was young and 
interesting that day everyone met with the words   
a wonderful just during the service but what a is 
how sorry i am   did i tell about 
kutuzov prince vasili now said with a pride  always 
said he was the only man capable of napoleon  
but next day no news arrived from the army and 
the public mood grew anxious the because of the suffering 
the the emperor   the emperor position said they 
and instead of kutuzov as they had done the day 
before they him as the cause of the emperor anxiety 
that day prince vasili no longer of his kutuzov but 
remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned moreover 
toward evening as if everything conspired to make petersburg society 
anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news was added 
countess helene had suddenly died of that terrible it had 
been so agreeable to mention at large gatherings everyone said 
that countess had died of a terrible attack of but 
in intimate were mentioned of how the private of the 
queen of had small of a certain to produce a 
certain effect but helene by the fact that the old 
count suspected her and that her husband to whom she 
had written  wretched pierre had not replied had suddenly 
taken a very large of the and had died in 
before could be her it was said that prince vasili 
and the old count had turned upon the italian but 
the latter had produced such from the unfortunate that they 
had immediately let the matter drop  talk in general 
round three melancholy the emperor lack of news the of 
kutuzov and the death of helene  on the third 
day after kutuzov report a country arrived from moscow and 
news of the of moscow to the french spread through 
the whole town this was terrible what a position for 
the emperor to be in kutuzov was a traitor and 
prince vasili during the visits of paid to him on 
the occasion of his daughter death said of kutuzov whom 
he had  was for him in his to forget 
what he had said that it was impossible to expect 
anything else from a and old man   only 
wonder that the fate of russia could have been to 
such a man  as long as this news remained 
it was possible to doubt it but the next day 
the following was received from count   prince kutuzov 
adjutant has brought me a letter in which he police 
officers to the army to the road he writes that 
he is moscow kutuzov the fate of the capital and 
of your empire russia will shudder to learn of the 
of the city in which her greatness is and in 
which lie the of your i shall follow the army 
i have had everything removed and it only remains for 
me to over the fate of my   on 
receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince to kutuzov with 
the following   prince michael ilarionovich since the twenty 
of august i have received no from you yet on 
the first of i received from the commander in chief 
of moscow the sad news that you with the army 
have decided to moscow you can yourself imagine the effect 
this news has had on me and your silence my 
i am sending this by adjutant prince to hear from 
you the situation of the army and the reasons that 
have you to take this melancholy decision    
  chapter iii   nine days after the 
of moscow a from kutuzov reached petersburg with the official 
of that this was a frenchman who did not know 
russian but who was de d  as he said 
of himself        though 
a russian in heart and soul   the emperor 
at once received this in his study at the on 
stone island who had never seen moscow before the and 
who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved  
he wrote when he appeared before tres  with the 
news of the burning of moscow     
     our most gracious sovereign  
       whose his  
 though the of must have been different from that 
which russians to he had such a sad face when 
shown into the emperor study that the latter at once 
asked   you brought me sad news colonel  
 sad replied lowering his eyes with a sigh  
of moscow   they my capital without a battle 
asked the emperor quickly his face suddenly flushing  respectfully 
delivered the kutuzov had to him which was that it 
had been impossible to fight before moscow and that as 
the only remaining choice was between losing the army as 
well as moscow or losing moscow alone the field had 
to choose the latter  the emperor listened in silence 
not looking at   the entered the city he 
asked   and moscow is now in i left 
it all in replied in a decided tone but glancing 
at the emperor he was frightened by what he had 
done  the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly 
his lower lip trembled and tears instantly appeared in his 
fine blue eyes  but this only a moment he 
suddenly frowned as if himself for his weakness and raising 
his head addressed in a firm voice   see 
colonel from all that is that great of us i 
am ready to myself in all things to his will 
but tell me how did you leave the army when 
it saw my capital without a battle did you not 
notice  seeing that his most gracious was calm once 
more also grew calm but was not immediately ready to 
reply to the emperor direct and question which a direct 
answer   will you allow me to speak as 
a he asked to gain time   i always 
it replied the emperor  nothing from me i wish 
to know absolutely how things are   said with 
a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on his lips having now 
prepared a well reply  i left the whole army 
from its to the lowest without exception in desperate and 
  is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly 
 make my russians lose heart never  had only 
waited for this to bring out the phrase he had 
prepared   he said with  are only afraid 
your majesty in the goodness of your heart should allow 
yourself to be to make peace they are burning for 
the declared this of the russian nation  to prove 
to your majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how 
devoted they are   said the emperor and with 
a kindly gleam in his eyes he on the shoulder 
 set me at ease colonel  he bent his 
head and was silent for some time   then 
go back to the army he said drawing himself up 
to his full height and addressing with a gracious and 
gesture  tell our men and all my good wherever 
you go that when i have not a left i 
shall put myself at the head of my and my 
good and so use the last of my empire it 
still me more than my suppose said the emperor growing 
more and more animated  should it ever be by 
he continued raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with 
 my should to on the throne of my then 
after all the means at my command i shall let 
my grow to here  pointed halfway down his chest 
 go and eat with the of my rather than 
sign the of my country and of my people whose 
i know how to appreciate  having uttered these words 
in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly turned away as 
if to hide from the tears that rose to his 
eyes and went to the further end of his study 
having stood there a few moments he strode back to 
and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous 
movement the emperor and handsome face was flushed and his 
eyes with resolution and anger   do not forget 
what i say to you here perhaps we may it 
with pleasure napoleon or i said the emperor touching his 
breast  can no longer both together i have learned 
to know him and he will not me any more 
 and the emperor paused with a frown  when 
he heard these words and saw the expression of firm 
resolution in the emperor eyes de d that solemn moment 
felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard  
he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his 
own and those of the russian people whose he considered 
himself to be in the following words   said 
he  majesty is at this moment the glory of 
the nation and the of europe  with an of 
the head the emperor dismissed him     
 chapter iv   it is natural for us 
who were not living in those days to imagine that 
when half russia had been conquered and the were to 
and one after another was being raised for the defense 
of the all russians from the greatest to the least 
were solely engaged in themselves their or weeping over its 
the and of that time without exception speak only of 
the self devotion despair and the of the russians but 
it was not really so it so to us because 
we see only the general interest of that time and 
do not see all the human interests that people had 
yet in those interests of the moment so much the 
general interests that they always prevent the public interest from 
being felt or even noticed most of the people at 
that time paid no attention to the general progress of 
but were only by their private interests and they were 
the very people whose at that period were most  
those who tried to understand the general course of and 
to take part in it by self and were the 
most members of society they saw everything down and all 
they did for the common good turned out to be 
and foolish pierre and which russian and the the young 
ladies prepared and that never reached the and so on 
even those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their 
who discussed russia position at the time introduced into their 
conversation either a of pretense and or and anger against 
people of actions no one could possibly be guilty of 
in the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit 
of the tree of knowledge is specially only fruit and 
he who a part in an never its if he 
to it his are  the more a man was 
engaged in the then taking place in russia the less 
did he their in petersburg and in the at a 
distance from moscow ladies and gentlemen in wept for russia 
and its capital and talked of self and so on 
but in the army which moscow there was little talk 
or thought of moscow and when they caught sight of 
its no one to be on the french but they 
thought about their next pay their next of the and 
like matters  as the war had caught him in 
the service nicholas rostov took a close and part in 
the defense of his country but did so without any 
aim at self and he therefore looked at what was 
going on in russia without despair and without his over 
it had he been asked what he thought of the 
state of russia he would have said that it was 
not his business to think about it that kutuzov and 
others were there for that purpose but that he had 
heard that the were to be made up to their 
full strength that would probably go on for a long 
time yet and that things being so it was quite 
likely he might be in command of a regiment in 
a of years time  as he looked at the 
matter in this way he learned that he was being 
sent to to buy for his not only without regret 
at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle 
but with the greatest pleasure he did not and which 
his comrades fully understood  a few days before the 
battle of nicholas received the necessary money and and having 
sent some hussars on in he set out with post 
horses for  only a man who has experienced it 
is has passed some months in an of and war 
understand the nicholas felt when he from the region covered 
by the army and when from soldiers and the of 
a saw with and women gentlemen country where cattle were 
with in them he as though seeing all this for 
the first time what for a long while specially surprised 
and delighted him were the women young and without a 
officers making up to each of them women too who 
were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke 
with them  in the highest nicholas arrived at night 
at a in ordered things he had long been of 
in and next day very clean and in a full 
uniform he had not worn for a long time went 
to present himself to the  the commander of the 
was a civilian general an old man who was evidently 
pleased with his military and rank he received nicholas  
this to be military and him with an important air 
as if considering the general progress of affairs and and 
with full right to do so nicholas was in such 
good that this merely amused him  from the commander 
of the he drove to the the was a little 
man very simple and he indicated the at which nicholas 
might procure horses recommended to him a horse in the 
town and a fourteen out of town who had the 
best horses and promised to assist him in every way 
  are count ilya rostov son my wife was 
a great friend of your mother we are at home 
on is thursday so please come and see us quite 
said the taking leave of him  immediately on leaving 
the nicholas post horses and taking his with him drove 
at a to the fourteen away who had the everything 
seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part 
of his stay in and as usually happens when a 
man is in a pleasant state of mind everything went 
well and easily  the to whom nicholas went was 
a bachelor an old a horse a the of some 
century and some old wine who had a where he 
smoked and who some splendid horses  in very few 
words nicholas picked for six thousand rubles serve as he 
said as of his after dining and taking rather too 
much of the wine nicholas exchanged with the with whom 
he was already on the terms back over in the 
frame of mind continually on the so as to be 
in time for the party  when he had changed 
water over his head and scented himself nicholas arrived at 
the rather late but with the phrase  late than 
never on his lips  it was not a ball 
nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew that catherine 
would play and the on the clavichord and that there 
would be dancing and so everyone had come as to 
a ball  life in  went on very much 
as usual but with this difference that it was in 
the in of the arrival of many wealthy families from 
moscow and as in everything that went on in russia 
at that time a special was an  for a 
penny in for a cares spirit and the small talk 
instead of turning on the weather and now turned on 
moscow the army and napoleon  the society gathered together 
at the was the best in  there were a 
great many ladies and some of nicholas moscow but there 
were no men who could at all with the of 
st george the hussar officer the good and well count 
rostov among the men was an italian an officer of 
the french army and nicholas felt that the presence of 
that his own importance as a russian hero the italian 
was as it were a war nicholas felt this it 
seemed to him that everyone regarded the italian in the 
same light and he treated him though with dignity and 
 as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform 
around him a of and wine and had uttered the 
words  late than never and heard them repeated several 
times by others people around him all eyes turned on 
him and he felt at once that he had entered 
into his proper position in the of a favorite a 
very pleasant position and so after his long at at 
and in the had been flattered by his notice and 
here too at the party there were  it seemed 
to nicholas an number of pretty young women married and 
unmarried awaiting his notice the women and girls with him 
and from the first day the people concerned themselves to 
get this fine young of an hussar married and settled 
down among these was the wife herself who rostov as 
a near and called him   catherine did play 
and the and dancing began in which nicholas still further 
the society by his his particularly free manner of dancing 
even surprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised at 
the way he danced that evening he had never danced 
like that in moscow and would even have considered such 
a very free and easy manner and in bad form 
but here he felt it on him to them all 
by something something they would have to accept as the 
regular thing in the capital though new to them in 
the  all the evening nicholas paid attention to a 
blue plump and little the wife of one of the 
with the naive conviction of young men in a merry 
mood that other men were for them rostov did not 
leave the lady side and treated her husband in a 
friendly and style as if without speaking of it they 
knew how nicholas and the lady would get on together 
the husband however did not seem to that conviction and 
tried to behave with rostov but the latter good naivete 
was so that sometimes even he to nicholas good toward 
the end of the evening however as the wife face 
grew more flushed and animated the husband became more and 
more melancholy and solemn as though there were but a 
given amount of animation between them and as the wife 
the husband      chapter v  
 nicholas sat slightly forward in an armchair bending over 
the lady and paying her with a smile that never 
left his face jauntily the position of his legs in 
their breeches an of and admiring his partner himself and 
the fine of his legs in their well nicholas told 
the lady that he wished to run away with a 
certain lady here in   lady   charming 
lady a one her eyes  looked at his partner 
 blue her mouth and her figure  glanced at 
her shoulders   the husband came up and sullenly 
asked his wife what she was talking about   
cried nicholas rising politely and as if wishing to his 
joke he began to tell him of his intention to 
with a lady  the husband smiled the wife gaily 
the good wife came up with a look of  
 wants to see you nicholas said she pronouncing the 
name so that nicholas at once understood that anna was 
a very important person  nicholas you know you let 
me call you so   yes aunt who is 
she   she has heard from her niece how 
you her can you guess   such a lot 
of them said nicholas   niece princess bolkonskaya she 
is here in with her aunt how you blush why

well very well oh what a fellow you are  
the wife led him up to a tall and very 
stout old lady with a blue who had just finished 
her game of cards with the most important of the 
town this was princess mary aunt on her mother side 
a rich widow who always lived in when rostov approached 
her she was standing settling up for the game she 
looked at him and screwing up her eyes sternly continued 
to the general who had won from her   
pleased mon cher she then said holding out her hand 
to nicholas  come and see me  after a 
few words about princess mary and her late father whom 
had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas knew 
of prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of 
hers the important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her 
invitation to come to see her  nicholas promised to 
come and blushed again as he bowed at the mention 
of princess mary he experienced a feeling of and even 
of fear which he himself did not understand  when 
he had from nicholas wished to return to the dancing 
but the little wife placed her plump hand on his 
sleeve and saying that she wanted to have a talk 
with him led him to her sitting room from which 
those who were there immediately so as not to be 
in her way   you know dear boy began 
the wife with a serious expression on her kind little 
face  really would be the match for you would 
you like me to arrange it   do you 
mean aunt asked nicholas   will make a match 
for you with the princess catherine of but i say 
no princess do you want me to do it i 
am sure your mother will be grateful to me what 
a charming girl she is really and she is not 
at all so plain either   at all replied 
nicholas as if offended at the idea  a aunt 
i don force myself on anyone or refuse anything he 
said before he had time to consider what he was 
saying   then remember this is not a joke 
  course not   yes the wife said 
as if talking to herself  my dear boy among 
other things you are too attentive to the other the 
one is sorry for the husband really   no 
we are good friends with him said nicholas in the 
of his heart it did not enter his head that 
a so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to 
someone else   what nonsense i have been saying 
to the wife thought nicholas suddenly at supper  will 
really begin to arrange a match and sonya and on 
taking leave of the wife when she again smilingly said 
to him  then remember he drew her aside  
 see here to tell the truth aunt   
is it my dear come let sit down here said 
she  nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to 
tell his most intimate thoughts  he would not have 
told to his mother his sister or his friend to 
this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards 
recalled that impulse to and which had very important for 
him it seemed to him it seems to everyone in 
such it was merely some silly whim that seized him 
yet that burst of together with other had immense for 
him and for all his family   see aunt 
mamma has long wanted me to marry an but the 
very idea of marrying for money is to me  
 yes i understand said the wife   princess 
bolkonskaya another matter i will tell you the truth in 
the first place i like her very much i feel 
drawn to her and then after i met her under 
such circumstances the idea often occurred to me  is 
fate especially if you remember that mamma had long been 
thinking of it but i had never happened to meet 
her before somehow it had always happened that we did 
not meet and as long as my sister natasha was 
engaged to her brother it was of course out of 
the question for me to think of marrying her and 
it must happen that i should meet her just when 
natasha had been broken off and then everything so you 
see i never told this to anyone and never will 
only to you  the wife pressed his elbow gratefully 
  know sonya my cousin i love her and 
promised to marry her and will do so so you 
see there can be no question about said nicholas and 
blushing   dear boy what a way to look 
at it you know sonya has nothing and you yourself 
say your papa affairs are in a very bad way 
and what about your mother it would kill her that 
one thing and what sort of life would it be 
for sonya she a girl with a heart your mother 
in despair and you all no my dear you and 
sonya ought to understand that  nicholas remained silent it 
him to hear these   the same aunt it 
is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a short 
pause  would the princess have me and besides she 
is now in mourning how can one think of it 
  you don suppose i going to get you 
married at once there is always a right way of 
doing things replied the wife   a you are 
aunt said nicholas kissing her plump little hand   
   chapter vi   on reaching moscow 
after her meeting with rostov princess mary had found her 
there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrew 
giving her how to get to her aunt at that 
feeling to which had tormented her during her father illness 
since his death and especially since her meeting with rostov 
was by for the anxiety about her brother settling in 
a new house meeting new people and to her education 
she was sad now after a month passed in quiet 
she felt more and more deeply the of her father 
which was in her mind with the of russia she 
was agitated and by the thought of the to which 
her brother the only intimate person now remaining to her 
was exposed she was too about her education for which 
she had always felt herself but in the of her 
soul she felt at peace peace from consciousness of having 
those and that had been on the point of within 
her and were related to her meeting with rostov  
the day after her party the wife came to see 
and after discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that 
though under present circumstances a was of course not to 
be thought of all the same the young people might 
be brought together and could get to know one another 
expressed approval and the wife began to speak of rostov 
in mary presence him and telling how he had blushed 
when princess mary name was mentioned but princess mary experienced 
a painful rather than a joyful feeling mental was destroyed 
and desires self and  during the two days that 
elapsed before rostov called princess mary continually thought of how 
she ought to behave to him first she decided not 
to come to the drawing room when he called to 
see her aunt it would not be proper for her 
in her deep mourning to receive visitors then she thought 
this would be after what he had done for her 
then it occurred to her that her aunt and the 
wife had intentions herself and rostov looks and words at 
times seemed to this she told herself that only she 
with her nature could think this of them they could 
not forget that as she was while still wearing deep 
mourning such matchmaking would be an to her and to 
her father memory assuming that she did go down to 
see him princess mary imagined the words he would say 
to her and what she would say to him and 
these words sometimes seemed cold and then to mean too 
much more than anything she feared the she felt might 
her and her as soon as she saw him  
but when on after the footman announced in the drawing 
room that count rostov had called the princess showed no 
only a slight blush her and her eyes lit up 
with a new and radiant light   have met 
him aunt said she in a calm voice unable herself 
to understand that she could be so calm and natural 
 when rostov entered the room the princess dropped her 
eyes for an instant as if to give the visitor 
time to her aunt and then just as nicholas turned 
to her she raised her head and met his look 
with shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and 
grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure held 
out her slender delicate hand to him and began to 
speak in a voice in which for the first time 
new deep womanly notes mademoiselle who was in the drawing 
room looked at princess mary in surprise herself a she 
could not have better on meeting a man she wished 
to attract   black is particularly becoming to her 
or she really has greatly without my having noticed it 
and above all what tact and grace thought mademoiselle  
had princess mary been capable of at that moment she 
would have been more surprised than mademoiselle at the change 
that had taken place in herself from the moment she 
recognized that dear loved face a new life force took 
of her and compelled her to speak and act apart 
from her own will from the time rostov entered her 
face became suddenly it was as if a light had 
been in a and and the work on its sides 
that seemed dark coarse and meaningless was suddenly shown up 
in and striking beauty for the first time all that 
through which she had lived appeared on the surface all 
her her with herself her sufferings her after goodness her 
love and self this now shone in those radiant eyes 
in her delicate smile and in every of her gentle 
face  rostov saw all this as clearly as if 
he had known her whole life he felt that the 
being before him was quite different from and better than 
anyone he had met before and above all better than 
himself  their conversation was very simple and they spoke 
of the war and like everyone else exaggerated their sorrow 
about it they spoke of their last meeting trying to 
change the subject talked of the kind wife of nicholas 
relations and of princess mary  she did not talk 
about her brother the conversation as soon as her aunt 
mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of russia with a 
certain but her brother was too near her heart and 
she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas 
noticed this as he noticed every of princess mary character 
with an observation to him and everything his conviction that 
she was a quite and extraordinary being nicholas blushed and 
was confused when people spoke to him about the princess 
 she did when he was mentioned and even when 
he thought of her but in her presence he felt 
quite at ease and said not at all what he 
had prepared but what quite occurred to him at the 
moment  when a pause occurred during his short visit 
nicholas as is usual when there are children turned to 
prince andrew little son him and asking whether he would 
like to be an hussar he took the boy on 
his knee played with him and looked round at princess 
mary with a happy timid look she watched the boy 
she loved in the arms of the man she loved 
nicholas also noticed that look and as if understanding it 
flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with 
good  as she was in mourning princess mary did 
not go out into society and nicholas did not think 
it the proper thing to visit her again but all 
the same the wife went on with her matchmaking passing 
on to nicholas the things princess mary said of him 
and and insisting on his himself to princess mary for 
this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people 
at the house before  though rostov told the wife 
that he would not make any declaration to princess mary 
he promised to go  as at rostov had not 
allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was 
right so now after a short but sincere between his 
effort to arrange his life by his own sense of 
and in to circumstances he chose the latter and to 
the power he felt carrying him he knew not where 
he knew that after his promise to sonya it would 
be what he base to his to princess mary and 
he knew that he would never act but he also 
knew  rather felt at the bottom of his heart 
that by himself now to the force of circumstances and 
to those who were him he was not only doing 
nothing wrong but was doing something very important important than 
anything he had ever done in his life  after 
meeting princess mary though the course of his life went 
on as before all his former lost their for him 
and he often thought about her but he never thought 
about her as he had thought of all the young 
ladies without exception whom he had met in society nor 
as he had for a long time and at one 
time thought about sonya he had each of those young 
ladies as almost all young men do that is as 
a possible wife her in his to all the of 
married life a white gown his wife at the tea 
table his wife carriage little ones mamma and papa their 
relations to her and so on these of the future 
had given him pleasure but with princess mary to whom 
they were trying to get him engaged he could never 
picture anything of future married life if he tried his 
seemed and it made him afraid     
 chapter vii   the dreadful news of the 
battle of of our in killed and and the still 
more terrible news of the of moscow reached in the 
middle of princess mary having learned of her brother wound 
only from the and having no definite news of him 
prepared  nicholas heard he had not seen her again 
himself to set off in search of prince andrew  
when he received the news of the battle of and 
the of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger 
the desire for or any feeling of that kind but 
everything in suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and 
he experienced an feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations 
he heard seemed to him he did not know how 
to judge all these affairs and felt that only in 
the regiment would everything again become clear to him he 
made to finish the horses and often became angry with 
his and  a few days before his a special 
at which nicholas was present was held in the for 
the russian he stood a little behind the and held 
himself with military decorum through the service on a great 
of when the service was over the wife him to 
her   you seen the princess she asked indicating 
with a movement of her head a lady standing on 
the opposite side the  nicholas immediately recognized princess mary 
not so much by the he saw under her as 
by the feeling of and pity that immediately him princess 
mary evidently by her thoughts was crossing herself for the 
last time before leaving the  nicholas looked at her 
face with surprise it was the same face he had 
seen before there was the same general expression of refined 
inner but now it was quite differently lit up there 
was a pathetic expression of sorrow and hope in it 
as had occurred before when she was present nicholas went 
up to her without waiting to be by the wife 
and not asking himself whether or not it was right 
and proper to her here in and told her he 
had heard of her trouble and with his whole soul 
as soon as she heard his voice a glow in 
her face up both her sorrow and her joy  
 is one thing i wanted to tell you princess 
said rostov  is that if your brother prince andrew 
were not living it would have been at once announced 
in the as he is a colonel  the princess 
looked at him not what he was saying but by 
the expression of sympathy on his face   i 
have known so many of a wound  said it 
was a  at once or being very slight continued 
nicholas  must hope for the best and i am 
sure  princess mary interrupted him   that would 
be so she began and prevented by agitation from finishing 
she bent her head with a movement as graceful as 
everything she did in his presence and looking up at 
him gratefully went out following her aunt  that evening 
nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to 
some accounts with the horse when he had finished that 
business it was already too late to go anywhere but 
still too early to go to bed and for a 
long time he up and down the room reflecting on 
his life a thing he did  princess mary had 
made an agreeable on him when he had met her 
in his having her in such exceptional circumstances and his 
mother having at one time mentioned her to him as 
a good match had drawn his particular attention to her 
when he met her again in the she made on 
him was not merely but powerful nicholas had been struck 
by the peculiar beauty he observed in her at this 
time he was however preparing to go away and it 
had not entered his head to regret that he was 
thus himself of of meeting her but that day in 
had he felt deeper than was for his peace of 
mind that pale sad refined face that radiant look those 
gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow 
expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his 
sympathy in men rostov could not bear to see the 
expression of a higher life  was why he did 
not like prince andrew and he to it contemptuously as 
and but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed 
the of a whole world foreign to him was an 
  must be a wonderful woman a real he 
said to himself  am i not free why was 
i in such a with sonya and he the two 
the lack of in the one and the of it 
in the other he himself lacked and therefore most highly 
he tried to picture what would happen were he free 
how he would to her and how she would become 
his wife but no he could not imagine that he 
felt and no clear picture itself to his mind he 
had long ago to himself a future with sonya and 
that was all clear and simple just because it had 
all been thought out and he knew all there was 
in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future 
with princess mary because he did not understand her but 
simply loved her  about sonya had had something merry 
and playful in them but to of princess mary was 
always difficult and a little   she he thought 
 was plain that her whole soul was in her 
yes that was the that and i am sure her 
will be answered why don i for what i want 
he suddenly thought  do i want to be free 
from sonya she was right he thought what the wife 
had said  but can come of marrying sonya for 
mamma business difficulties terrible besides i don love her as 
i should o god release me from this dreadful position 
he suddenly began to  can move but one must 
have faith and not as natasha and i used to 
as children that the snow might turn into then run 
out into the yard to see whether it had done 
so no but i am not for trifles now he 
thought as he put his pipe down in a corner 
and his hands placed himself before the by of princess 
mary he began to as he had not done for 
a long time tears were in his eyes and in 
his when the door opened and came in with some 
papers   why do you come in without being 
called cried nicholas quickly changing his attitude   the 
said in a sleepy voice  courier has arrived and 
there a letter for you   all right you 
can go  nicholas took the two one of which 
was from his mother and the other from sonya he 
recognized them by the and opened sonya first he had 
read only a few lines when he turned pale and 
his eyes opened wide with fear and joy   
it not possible he cried aloud  unable to sit 
still he up and down the room holding the letter 
and reading it he glanced through it then read it 
again and then again and standing still in the middle 
of the room he raised his shoulders out his hands 
with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what 
he had just been for with confidence that god would 
hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as 
much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and and 
as if the very fact that it had happened so 
quickly that it had not come from god to whom 
he had but by some ordinary  this and as 
it seemed to nicholas quite letter from sonya him from 
the that him and from which there had seemed no 
escape she wrote that the last unfortunate of almost the 
whole of the rostovs moscow property the countess expressed wish 
that nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya together with his silence 
and of late had all to make her decide to 
release him from his promise and set him completely free 
  it would be too painful to me to 
think that i might be a cause of sorrow or 
in the family that has been so good to me 
 wrote and my love has no aim but the 
happiness of those i love so nicholas i beg you 
to consider yourself free and to be that in spite 
of everything no one can love you more than does 
 your sonya   both were written from the 
other from the countess described their last days in moscow 
their the fire and the of all their property in 
this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was 
among the with them his state was very but the 
doctor said there was now more hope sonya and natasha 
were him  next day nicholas took his mother letter 
and went to see princess mary neither he nor she 
said a word about what  him might mean but 
to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with 
the princess as if they were relations  the following 
day he saw princess mary off on her to and 
a few days later left to his regiment   
   chapter viii   sonya letter written 
from which had come as an answer to nicholas was 
by this the thought of getting nicholas married to an 
occupied the old countess mind more and more she knew 
that sonya was the chief to this and sonya life 
in the countess house had grown and especially after they 
had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting 
with princess mary in the countess let no occasion slip 
of making humiliating or cruel to sonya  but a 
few days before they left moscow moved and by all 
that was going on she called sonya to her and 
instead of and making on her her to sacrifice herself 
and all that the family had done for her by 
breaking off her with nicholas   shall not be 
at peace till you promise me this  sonya burst 
into tears and replied through her that she would do 
anything and was prepared for anything but gave no promise 
and could not bring herself to decide to do what 
was demanded of her she must sacrifice herself for the 
family that had and brought her up to sacrifice herself 
for others was sonya habit her position in the house 
was such that only by sacrifice could she show her 
worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing 
it but in all her former acts of self she 
had been conscious that they raised her in her own 
and in that of others and so made her more 
worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in 
the world but now they wanted her to sacrifice the 
very thing that the whole reward for her self and 
the whole meaning of her life and for the first 
time she felt against those who had been her only 
to torture her the more she felt of natasha who 
had never experienced anything of this sort had never to 
sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves for her and 
yet was by everybody and for the first time sonya 
felt that out of her quiet love for nicholas a 
passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was than 
or under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life 
of had taught her to be having answered the countess 
in general terms talking with her and to wait till 
she should see nicholas not in order to set him 
free but on the contrary at that meeting to him 
to her forever  the and of the rostovs last 
days in moscow the gloomy thoughts that sonya she was 
glad to find escape from them in practical but when 
she heard of prince andrew presence in their house despite 
her sincere pity for him and for natasha she was 
seized by a joyful and feeling that god did not 
her to be from nicholas she knew that natasha loved 
no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to 
love him she knew that being thrown together again under 
such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with 
one another and that nicholas would then not be able 
to marry princess mary as they would be within the 
of despite all the of what had happened during those 
last days and during the first days of their this 
feeling that was in her affairs sonya  at the 
the rostovs first broke their for a whole day  
three large rooms were assigned to them in the one 
of which was occupied by prince andrew the man was 
much better that day and natasha was sitting with him 
in the next room sat the count and countess respectfully 
conversing with the who was calling on them as old 
and of the sonya was there too tormented by curiosity 
as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about 
she heard the sound of their voices through the door 
that door opened and natasha came out looking not noticing 
the who had to her and was drawing back the 
wide sleeve on his right arm she went up to 
sonya and took her hand   what are you 
about come here said the countess  natasha went up 
to the for his and he her to for to 
god and his saint  as soon as the natasha 
took her friend by the hand and went with her 
into the room   will he live she asked 
 how happy i am and how unhappy sonya everything 
is as it used to be if only he lives 
he cannot because because of and natasha burst into tears 
  i knew it thank god murmured sonya  
will live  sonya was not less agitated than her 
friend by the latter fear and and by her own 
which she with no one sobbing she kissed and natasha 
 only he lives she thought having wept talked and 
away their tears the two friends went together to prince 
andrew door natasha opened it and glanced into the room 
sonya standing beside her at the half door  prince 
andrew was lying raised high on three his pale face 
was calm his eyes closed and they could see his 
regular breathing   natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed her 
companion arm and back from the door   what 
is it asked natasha   that that said sonya 
with a white face and lips  natasha softly closed 
the door and went with sonya to the window not 
yet understanding what the latter was telling her   
remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression  
remember when i looked in the mirror for you at 
at do you remember what i saw   yes 
cried natasha opening her eyes wide and that sonya had 
told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen 
lying down   remember sonya went on  saw 
it then and told everybody you and i saw him 
lying on a bed said she making a gesture with 
her hand and a lifted finger at each  that 
he had his eyes closed and was covered just with 
a pink and that his hands were she concluded herself 
that the she had just seen were exactly what she 
had seen in the mirror  she had in fact 
seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that 
came into her head but what she had then seemed 
to her now as real as any other she not 
only remembered what she had then said he turned to 
look at her and smiled and was covered with something 
red was firmly convinced that she had then seen and 
said that he was covered with a pink and that 
his eyes were closed   yes it really was 
pink cried natasha who now thought she too remembered the 
word pink being used and saw in this the most 
extraordinary and part of the   what does it 
mean she added   i don know it is 
all so strange replied sonya at her head  a 
few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to 
him but sonya feeling and touched remained at the window 
thinking about the of what had occurred   they 
had an opportunity that day to send to the army 
and the countess was to her son   said 
the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her 
niece passed  won you write to nicholas she spoke 
in a soft voice and in the weary eyes that 
looked over her spectacles sonya read all that the countess 
meant to with these words those eyes expressed entreaty shame 
at having to ask fear of a and for hatred 
in case of such  sonya went up to the 
countess and down kissed her hand   mamma i 
will write said she  sonya was and touched by 
all that had occurred that day especially by the fulfillment 
she had just seen of her now that she knew 
that the of natasha relations with prince andrew would prevent 
nicholas from marrying princess mary she was joyfully conscious of 
a return of that self spirit in which she was 
accustomed to live and loved to live so with a 
joyful consciousness of a deed several times by the tears 
that her black eyes wrote that touching letter the arrival 
of which had so nicholas      
chapter ix   the officer and soldiers who had 
pierre treated him with but yet with respect in the 
to which he was taken in their attitude toward him 
could still be felt both as to who he might 
be a very important person as a result of their 
with him  but when the was relieved next morning 
pierre felt that for the new officers and men was 
not as interesting as he had been to his and 
in fact the of the second day did not recognize 
in this big stout man in a coat the vigorous 
person who had fought so desperately with the and the 
and had uttered those solemn words about a child they 
saw in him only no  of the captured russians 
and detained for some reason by order of the higher 
command if they noticed anything about pierre it was only 
his unabashed and and the way he spoke french which 
struck them as good in spite of this he was 
placed that day with the other as the separate room 
he had occupied was by an officer  all the 
russians with pierre were men of the lowest class and 
him as a they all him more especially as he 
spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun 
of him  that evening he learned that all these 
prisoners  probably among them were to be tried for 
on the third day he was taken with the others 
to a house where a french general with a white 
mustache sat with two and other with on their arms 
with the precision and in addressing prisoners and which is 
to human pierre like the others was as to who 
he was where he had been with what object and 
so on  these questions like questions put at generally 
left the of the matter aside out the of that 
being revealed and were only to form a channel through 
which the wished the of the to flow so as 
to lead to the desired result a conviction as soon 
as pierre began to say anything that did not fit 
in with that aim the channel was removed and the 
water could flow to pierre felt moreover what the always 
feel at their as to why these questions were put 
to him he had a feeling that it was only 
out of condescension or a kind of that this of 
placing a channel was employed he knew he was in 
these men power that only by force had they brought 
him there that force alone gave them the right to 
demand to their questions and that the sole object of 
that was to him and so as they had the 
power and wish to him this of an inquiry and 
seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would lead 
to conviction when asked what he was doing when he 
was pierre replied in a rather manner that he was 
to its parents a child he had from the why 
had he fought the pierre answered that he  a 
woman and that  a woman who was being was 
the duty of every man that they interrupted him for 
this was not to the point why was he in 
the yard of a burning house where had seen him 
he replied that he had gone out to see what 
was in moscow again they interrupted him they had not 
asked where he was going but why he was found 
near the fire who was he they asked repeating their 
first question which he had declined to answer again he 
replied that he could not answer it   that 
down that bad very bad sternly remarked the general with 
the white mustache and red flushed face   on 
the fourth day broke out on the  pierre and 
thirteen others were moved to the house of a house 
near the bridge on his way through the pierre felt 
by the smoke which seemed to over the whole city 
were visible on all sides he did not then the 
of the burning of moscow and looked at the with 
horror  he passed four days in the house near 
the bridge and during that time learned from the talk 
of the french soldiers that all those there were awaiting 
a decision which might come any day from the what 
this was pierre could not learn from the soldiers evidently 
for them  a very high and rather power  
these first days before the of when the prisoners were 
had up for a second were the of all for 
pierre      chapter x   
on the of an officer very important one by the 
respect the guards showed him the house where the prisoners 
were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding 
a paper in his hand and called over all the 
russians there pierre as  man who does not give 
his name glancing and indifferently at all the prisoners he 
ordered the officer in to have them dressed and up 
before taking them to the an hour later a of 
soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to 
the field it was a fine day after rain and 
the air was the smoke did not low as on 
the day when pierre had been taken from the on 
the but rose through the air in no were seen 
but of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow 
as far as pierre could see was one on all 
sides there were with only and still standing and here 
and there the of some pierre gazed at the and 
did not recognize he had known well here and there 
he could see that had not been the which was 
not destroyed white in the distance with its and the 
of the great the of the new of the and 
its were ringing particularly clearly these reminded pierre that it 
was and the of the of the but there seemed 
to be no one to this everywhere were and the 
few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people 
who tried to hide when they saw the french  
it was plain that the russian was and destroyed but 
in place of the russian order of life that had 
been destroyed pierre felt that a quite different firm french 
order had been over this he felt this in the 
looks of the soldiers who in regular ranks briskly and 
gaily were him and the other he felt it in 
the looks of an important french official in a carriage 
and pair driven by a whom they met on the 
way he felt it in the merry sounds of music 
he heard from the left side of the field and 
felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners 
the french officer had read out when he came that 
morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers 
and led first to one and then to another place 
with of other men and it seemed that they might 
have forgotten him or confused him with the others but 
no the he had given when had come back to 
him in his as  man who does not give 
his name and under that which to pierre seemed terrible 
they were now leading him somewhere with assurance on their 
faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly 
the ones they wanted and that they were being taken 
to the proper place pierre felt himself to be an 
insignificant among the wheels of a machine whose he did 
not understand but which was well  he and the 
other prisoners were taken to the right side of the 
field to a large white house with an immense garden 
not far from the this was prince house where pierre 
had often been in other days and which as he 
learned from the talk of the soldiers was now occupied 
by the the of   they were taken to 
the entrance and led into the house one by one 
pierre was the to enter he was conducted through a 
glass gallery an anteroom and a hall which were familiar 
to him into a long low study at the door 
of which stood an adjutant  spectacles on nose sat 
bent over a table at the further end of the 
room pierre went close up to him but evidently a 
paper that lay before him did not look up without 
raising his eyes he said in a low voice  
 are you  pierre was silent because he was 
incapable of uttering a word to him was not merely 
a french general but a man notorious for his looking 
at his cold face as he sat like a stern 
who was prepared to wait for an answer pierre felt 
that every instant of delay might cost him his life 
but he did not know what to say he did 
not to what he had said at his first yet 
to his rank and position was dangerous and so he 
was silent but before he had decided what to do 
raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead 
screwed up his eyes and looked at him   
know that man he said in a cold measured tone 
evidently to pierre  the that had been running down 
pierre back now seized his head as in a  
 cannot know me general i have never seen you 
  is a russian interrupted addressing another general who 
was present but whom pierre had not noticed  turned 
away with an in his voice pierre rapidly began  
 he said suddenly that was a  you cannot 
have known me i am a officer and have not 
moscow   name asked     have 
i that you are not lying   exclaimed pierre 
not in an offended but in a voice  looked 
up and gazed at him for some they looked at 
one another and that look pierre apart from of war 
and law that look human relations between the two men 
at that moment an immense number of things passed through 
both their minds and they realized that they were both 
children of and were  at the first glance when 
had only raised his head from the papers where human 
affairs and lives were indicated by pierre was merely a 
and could have him without his conscience with an deed 
but now he saw in him a human being he 
reflected for a moment   can you show me 
that you are telling the truth said coldly  pierre 
remembered and named him and his regiment and the street 
where the house was   are not what you 
say returned  in a voice pierre began of the 
truth of his  but at that moment an adjutant 
entered and something to  brightened up at the news 
the adjutant brought and began up his uniform it seemed 
that he had quite forgotten pierre  when the adjutant 
reminded him of the he his head in pierre direction 
with a frown and ordered him to be led away 
but where they were to take him pierre did not 
know back to the house or to the place of 
execution his had pointed out to him as they the 
field  he turned his head and saw that the 
adjutant was putting another question to   of course 
replied but what this  meant pierre did not know 
 pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether 
it was far or in which direction his were quite 
he was and noticing nothing around him went on moving 
his legs as the others did till they all stopped 
and he stopped too the only thought in his mind 
at that time was who was it that had really 
sentenced him to death not the men on the that 
had first examined him one of them wished to or 
evidently could have done it it was not who had 
looked at him in so human a way in another 
moment would have realized that he was doing wrong but 
just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him 
the adjutant also had evidently had no intent though he 
might have refrained from coming in then who was executing 
him him him of life pierre with all his and 
thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it 
was no one  it was a system of circumstances 
 a system of some sort was him him of 
life of everything him      chapter 
xi   from prince house the prisoners were led 
straight down the field to the left of the as 
far as a kitchen garden in which a post had 
been set up that post a fresh had been in 
the ground and near the post and the a large 
crowd stood in a the crowd of a few russians 
and many of napoleon soldiers who were not on duty 
and in a of to the right and left of 
the post stood rows of french in blue with red 
and high and  the prisoners were placed in a 
certain order to the list  was and were led 
to the post several suddenly began to beat on both 
sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as 
if part of his soul had been away he lost 
the power of thinking or understanding he could only hear 
and see and he had only one wish the thing 
that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round 
at his fellow prisoners and them  the two first 
were with heads one was tall and thin the other 
dark and with a flat nose the third was a 
about forty years old with hair and a plump well 
body the fourth was a a very handsome man with 
a broad light and black eyes the was a hand 
a thin sallow lad of in a coat  pierre 
heard the french whether to them separately or two at 
a time  couples replied the officer in command in 
a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks 
of the soldiers and it was evident that they were 
all hurrying as men to do something they understand but 
as people to finish a necessary but unpleasant and task 
 a french official wearing a scarf came up to 
the right of the row of prisoners and read out 
the sentence in russian and in french  then two 
of approached the and at the officer command took the 
two who stood first in the row the stopped when 
they reached the post and while were being brought looked 
around as a looks at an approaching one himself continually 
the other his back and made a movement of the 
lips a smile with hurried hands the soldiers them drawing 
the over their heads and them to the post  
twelve with stepped out of the ranks with a firm 
regular and eight from the post pierre turned away to 
avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a rolling 
noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the 
most and he looked round there was some smoke and 
the were doing something near the with pale faces and 
hands two more prisoners were led up in the same 
way and with looks these two glanced at the with 
only a silent appeal for in their eyes evidently unable 
to understand or believe what was going to happen to 
them they could not believe it because they alone knew 
what their life meant to them and so they neither 
understood nor believed that it could be taken from them 
 again pierre did not wish to look and again 
turned away but again the sound as of a struck 
his and at the same moment he saw smoke blood 
and the pale scared faces of the who were again 
doing something by the post their hands one another pierre 
breathing heavily looked around as if asking what it meant 
the same question was expressed in all the looks that 
met his  on the faces of all the russians 
and of the french soldiers and officers without exception he 
read the same dismay horror and that were in his 
own heart  who after all is doing this they 
are all suffering as i am who then is it 
who flashed for an instant through his mind   
of the  forward shouted someone the the one next 
to pierre was led away pierre did not understand that 
he was that he and the rest had been brought 
there only to witness the execution with ever horror and 
no sense of joy or relief he gazed at what 
was taking place the man was the lad in the 
cloak the moment they laid hands on him he aside 
in and clutched at pierre  and shook himself free 
the lad was unable to walk they him along holding 
him up under the arms and he screamed when they 
got him to the post he grew quiet as if 
he suddenly understood something whether he understood that was or 
whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him 
at any rate he took his stand at the post 
waiting to be like the others and like a animal 
looked around him with eyes  pierre was no longer 
able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity 
and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the 
highest pitch at this murder like the others this man 
seemed calm he wrapped his cloak closer and rubbed one 
bare foot with the other  when they began to 
him he himself adjusted the which hurt the back of 
his head then when they him against the post he 
leaned back and not being comfortable in that position himself 
adjusted his feet and leaned back again more pierre did 
not take his eyes from him and did not miss 
his slightest movement  probably a word of command was 
given and was followed by the reports of eight but 
try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having 
heard the slightest sound of the he only saw how 
the suddenly down on the that held him how blood 
showed itself in two places how the under the weight 
of the hanging body and how the sat down his 
head hanging unnaturally and one bent under him pierre ran 
up to the post no one him pale frightened people 
were doing something around the the lower of an old 
frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he the the 
body the soldiers it awkwardly from the post and began 
pushing it into the  they all plainly and certainly 
knew that they were who must hide the of their 
as quickly as possible  pierre glanced into the and 
saw that the lad was lying with his knees close 
up to his head and one shoulder higher than the 
other that shoulder rose and fell and convulsively but of 
earth were already being thrown over the whole body one 
of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted and angrily at pierre 
to go back but pierre did not understand him and 
remained near the post and no one drove him away 
 when the had been filled up a command was 
given pierre was taken back to his place and the 
rows of on both sides of the post made a 
half turn and went past it at a measured the 
twenty with standing in the center of the circle ran 
back to their places as the passed by  pierre 
gazed now with eyes at these who ran in couples 
out of the circle all but one rejoined their this 
one a young his face pale his pushed back and 
his resting on the ground still stood near the at 
the spot from which he had he swayed like a 
drunken man taking some steps forward and back to save 
himself from falling an old officer ran out of the 
ranks and taking him by the elbow him to his 
company the crowd of russians and began to they all 
went away silently and with drooping heads   will 
them to start said one of the  pierre glanced 
round at the speaker and saw that it was a 
who was trying to find some relief after what had 
been done but was not able to do so without 
finishing what he had to say he made a hopeless 
movement with his arm and went away    
  chapter xii   after the execution pierre 
was from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone 
in a small and  toward evening a officer entered 
with two soldiers and told him that he had been 
and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners 
of war without understanding what was said to him pierre 
got up and went with the soldiers they took him 
to the upper end of the field where there were 
some built of and and led him into one of 
them in the some twenty different men pierre he looked 
at them without understanding who they were why they were 
there or what they wanted of him he heard what 
they said but did not understand the meaning of the 
words and made no kind of from or of them 
he replied to questions they put to him but did 
not consider who was listening to his nor how they 
would understand them he looked at their faces and but 
they all seemed to him meaningless  from the moment 
pierre had those terrible committed by men who did not 
wish to commit them it was as if the of 
his life on which everything and which made everything appear 
had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had into a 
of meaningless though he did not it to himself his 
faith in the right of the in in his own 
soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced 
this before but never so strongly as now when had 
him before they had been the result of his own 
and at the bottom of his heart he had felt 
that relief from his despair and from those was to 
be found within himself but now he felt that the 
had before his eyes and only meaningless remained and this 
not by any of his own he felt that it 
was not in his power to faith in the meaning 
of life  around him in the men were standing 
and evidently something about him interested them greatly they were 
telling him something and asking him something then they led 
him away somewhere and at last he found himself in 
a corner of the among men who were laughing and 
talking on all sides   then that very prince 
who some voice at the other end of the was 
saying with a strong emphasis on the word who  
sitting silent and on a of straw against the wall 
pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as 
soon as he closed them he saw before him the 
dreadful face of the lad dreadful because of its the 
faces of the even more dreadful because of their and 
he opened his eyes again and stared into the around 
him  beside him in a position sat a small 
man of whose presence he was first made aware by 
a strong smell of which came from him every time 
he moved this man was doing something to his legs 
in the and though pierre could not see his face 
he felt that the man continually glanced at him on 
growing used to the pierre saw that the man was 
taking off his and the way he did it pierre 
interest  having the string that tied the band on 
one he carefully it up and immediately set to work 
on the other glancing up at pierre while one hand 
up the first string the other was already the band 
on the second in this way having carefully removed the 
by of his arm following one another the man the 
up on some fixed above his head then he took 
out a cut something closed the placed it under the 
head of his bed and himself clasped his arms round 
his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the 
latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting and well in 
these movements in the man well in his corner and 
even in his very smell and he looked at the 
man without taking his eyes from him   seen 
a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly 
said  and there was so much and in his 
voice that pierre tried to reply but his trembled and 
he felt tears rising to his eyes the little fellow 
giving pierre no time to his instantly continued in the 
same pleasant tones   lad don fret said he 
in the tender voice old russian women  fret friend 
an hour live for an age that how it is 
my dear fellow and here we live thank heaven without 
among these too there are good men as well as 
bad said he and still speaking he turned on his 
knees with a movement got up and went off to 
another part of the   you pierre heard the 
same kind voice saying at the other end of the 
 you come you she now now that do  
and the pushing away a little dog that was up 
at him returned to his place and sat down in 
his hands he had something wrapped in a   
eat a bit sir said he resuming his former tone 
as he and offered pierre some  had for dinner 
and the are grand  pierre had not all day 
and the smell of the seemed pleasant to him he 
thanked the and began to eat   are they 
all right said the with a smile  should do 
like this  he took a drew out his cut 
the into two equal on the palm of his hand 
some on it from the and it to pierre  
 are grand he said once more  some like 
that  pierre thought he had never anything that tasted 
better   i all right said he  why 
did they those poor fellows the last one was hardly 
twenty   said the little man  what a 
sin what a sin he added quickly and as if 
his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and 
out he went on  was it sir that you 
stayed in moscow   didn think they would come 
so soon i stayed replied pierre   how did 
they you dear lad at your house   i 
went to look at the fire and they me there 
and tried me as an   there law there 
put in the little man   have you been 
here long pierre asked as he the last of the 
  it was last they took me out of 
a hospital in moscow   are you a then 
  we are soldiers of the regiment i was 
dying of we weren told anything there were some twenty 
of us lying there we had no idea never guessed 
at all   do you feel sad here pierre 
inquired   can one help it lad my name

it for pierre to him  call me  in 
the regiment how is one to help feeling sad moscow 
the mother of cities how can one see all this 
and not feel sad but  the yet first that 
what the old used to tell us he added rapidly 
  what did you say asked pierre   
i said  say things happen not as we plan 
but as god he replied thinking that he was repeating 
what he had said before and immediately continued   
and you have you a family sir and a house 
so you have then and a and your old parents 
are they still living he asked  and though it 
was too dark for pierre to see he felt that 
a suppressed smile of puckered the lips as he put 
these questions he seemed that pierre had no parents especially 
that he had no mother   wife for a 
mother for but there none as dear as one own 
mother said he  and have you little ones he 
went on asking  again pierre answer seemed to distress 
him and he hastened to add   mind you 
young yet and please god may still have some the 
great thing is to live in   it all 
the same now pierre could not help saying   
my dear fellow rejoined  a or a  he 
seated himself more and evidently preparing to tell a long 
story   my dear fellow i was still living 
at home he began  had a well of land 
we lived well and our house was one to thank 
god for when father and we went out there were 
seven of us we lived well we were real it 
so happened  and told a long story of how 
he had gone into someone to take wood how he 
had been caught by the had been tried and sent 
to serve as a   lad and a smile 
changed the tone of his voice  thought it was 
a but it turned out a if it had not 
been for my sin my brother would have had to 
go as a but he my younger brother had five 
little ones while i you see only left a wife 
behind we had a little girl but god took her

that how it is dear fellow fate looks for a 
head but we are always  not well not right 
our luck is like water in a you pull at 
it and it but when you drawn it out it 
empty that how it is  and his seat on 
the straw  after a short silence he rose  
 i think you must be sleepy said he and 
began rapidly crossing himself and repeating   saint nicholas 
and saint nicholas and have mercy on us and save 
us he concluded then bowed to the ground got up 
and sat down again on his of straw  the 
way lay me down like a stone o god and 
me up like a he muttered as he lay down 
pulling his coat over him   was that you 
were saying asked pierre   murmured who had almost 
 was i saying i was don you   
i do said pierre  what was that you said 
and   of course replied quickly  horses one 
must pity the too eh the now you up and 
got warm you daughter of a said touching the dog 
that lay at his feet and again turning over he 
fell immediately  sounds of crying and came from somewhere 
in the distance outside and were visible through the of 
the but inside it was quiet and dark for a 
long time pierre did not sleep but lay with eyes 
open in the listening to the regular of who lay 
beside him and he felt that the world that had 
been was once more stirring in his soul with a 
new beauty and on new and foundations    
  chapter xiii   twenty soldiers three officers 
and two were in the in which pierre had been 
placed and where he remained for four  when pierre 
remembered them afterwards they all seemed to him except who 
always remained in his mind a most and precious memory 
and the of everything russian kindly and round when pierre 
saw his next morning at dawn the first of him 
as of something round was fully whole figure a french 
girdled with a a cap and shoes round his head 
was quite round his back chest shoulders and even his 
arms which he held as if ever ready to embrace 
something were his pleasant smile and his large gentle brown 
eyes were also round  must have been fifty by 
his stories of he had been in told as by 
an old he did not himself know his age and 
was quite unable to it but his white strong teeth 
which showed in two when he laughed he often did 
all sound and good there was not a gray hair 
in his or on his head and his whole body 
gave an of and especially of and  his face 
despite its fine wrinkles had an expression of and youth 
his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief peculiarity 
of his speech was its and it was evident that 
he never considered what he had said or was going 
to say and the and of his intonation had an 
 his strength and during the first days of his 
were such that he seemed not to know what and 
meant every night before lying down he said  lay 
me down as a stone and me up as a 
and every morning on getting up he said  lay 
down and up i get up and myself and indeed 
he only had to lie down to fall like a 
stone and he only had to himself to be ready 
without a moment delay for some work just as children 
are ready to play they he could do everything not 
very well but not badly he and he was always 
busy and only at night allowed himself conversation which he 
was fond he did not sing like a singer who 
knows he is listened to but like the birds evidently 
giving to the sounds in the same way that one 
or about to get rid of and the sounds were 
always high mournful delicate and almost feminine and his face 
at such times was very serious  having been taken 
and allowed his to grow he seemed to have thrown 
off all that had been forced upon him military and 
to himself had returned to his former   on 
leave shirt outside breeches he would say  he did 
not like talking about his life as a though he 
did not complain and often mentioned that he had not 
been once during the whole of his army service when 
he related anything it was generally some old and evidently 
precious memory of his  life as he called his 
the of which his talk was full were for the 
most part not the coarse and soldiers but those which 
taken without a seem so insignificant but when used suddenly 
a of profound  he would often say the opposite 
of what he had said on a previous occasion yet 
both would be right he liked to talk and he 
talked well his speech with terms of and with which 
pierre thought he himself but the chief of his talk 
lay in the fact that the just such as pierre 
had without taking notice of them in a character of 
solemn he liked to hear the one of the soldiers 
used to tell of an evening  were always the 
same but most of all he liked to hear stories 
of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to 
such stories now and then putting in a word or 
asking a question to make the beauty of what he 
was told clear to himself had no or love as 
pierre understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything 
life brought him in with particularly with man any particular 
man but those with whom he happened to be he 
loved his dog his comrades the french and pierre who 
was his but pierre felt that in spite of affectionate 
tenderness for him  which he gave pierre life its 
he would not have for a moment at from him 
and pierre began to feel in the same way toward 
 to all the other prisoners seemed a most ordinary 
they called him  or  him good and sent 
him on but to pierre he always remained what he 
had seemed that first night an of the spirit of 
and truth  knew nothing by heart except his when 
he began to speak he seemed not to know how 
he would  sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of 
his words would ask him to them but could never 
what he had said a moment before just as he 
never could to pierre the words of his favorite song 
and tree and my heart is occurred in it but 
when spoken and not no meaning could be got out 
of it he did not and could not understand the 
meaning of words apart from their every word and of 
his was the of an to him which was his 
life but his life as he regarded it had no 
meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as 
part of a whole of which he was always conscious 
his words and actions from him as and as from 
a flower he could not understand the value or of 
any word or deed taken separately     
 chapter xiv   when princess mary heard from 
nicholas that her brother was with the rostovs at she 
at once prepared to go there in spite of her 
aunt to her not merely to go herself but to 
take her with her whether it were difficult or easy 
possible or impossible she did not ask and did not 
want to know it was her duty not only herself 
to be near her brother who was perhaps dying but 
to do everything possible to take his son to him 
and so she prepared to set off that she had 
not heard from prince andrew himself princess mary to his 
being too weak to write or to his considering the 
long too hard and too dangerous for her and his 
son  in a few days princess mary was ready 
to start her were the huge family in which she 
had to a trap and a with her mademoiselle little 
nicholas and his tutor her old nurse three maids and 
a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to 
her  the usual through moscow could not be thought 
of and the way princess mary was to take through 
and was very long and as post horses were not 
everywhere very difficult and near where the french were said 
to have shown themselves was even dangerous  during this 
difficult mademoiselle and princess mary were astonished at her energy 
and of spirit she went to bed later and rose 
earlier than any of them and no difficulties her to 
her and energy which her fellow they approached by the 
end of the second week  the last days of 
her stay in had been the of her life her 
love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her it 
filled her whole soul had become an part of herself 
and she no longer against it she had become convinced 
that she loved and was though she never said this 
to herself in words she had become convinced of it 
at her last interview with nicholas when he had come 
to tell her that her brother was with the rostovs 
not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the 
fact that prince andrew relations with natasha might if he 
be but princess mary saw by his face that he 
knew and thought of this  yet in spite of 
that his relation to her delicate and only remained but 
it sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even 
glad that the family connection between them allowed him to 
express his friendship more she knew that she loved for 
the first and only time in her life and felt 
that she was and was happy in regard to it 
 but this happiness on one side of her nature 
did not prevent her feeling for her brother with full 
force on the contrary that on the one side made 
it the more possible for her to give full play 
to her feeling for her brother that feeling was so 
strong at the moment of leaving that those who saw 
her off as they looked at her careworn face felt 
sure she would fall ill on the but the very 
difficulties and of the which she took so in hand 
her for a while from her and gave her strength 
 as always happens when princess mary thought only of 
the itself forgetting its object but as she approached the 
thought of what might her there after many days but 
that very evening itself to her and her agitation to 
its  the courier who had been sent on in 
to find out where the rostovs were staying in and 
in what condition prince andrew was when he met the 
big just entering the town was by the terrible of 
the princess face that looked out at him from the 
window   have found out everything your excellency the 
rostovs are staying at the house in the square not 
far from here right above the said the courier  
princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding 
why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted 
to know how was her brother mademoiselle put that question 
for her   is the prince she asked  
 excellency is staying in the same house with them 
  he is thought princess mary and asked in 
a low voice  is he   say he 
is still the same  what  the same might 
mean princess mary did not ask but with an glance 
at little seven nicholas who was sitting in front of 
her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her 
head and did not it again till the heavy shaking 
and swaying came to a stop the carriage steps as 
they were let down  the carriage door was opened 
on the left there was water great river on the 
right a porch there were people at the entrance and 
a rosy girl with a large of black hair smiling 
as it seemed to princess mary in an affected way 
 was sonya princess mary ran up the steps  
way this way said the girl with the same artificial 
smile and the princess found herself in the hall facing 
an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly to 
meet her with a look of this was the countess 
she embraced princess mary and kissed her   she 
muttered  vous vous       
   child i love you and have known 
you a long time    despite her excitement 
princess mary realized that this was the countess and that 
it was necessary to say something to her hardly knowing 
how she did it she to utter a few polite 
phrases in french in the same tone as those that 
had been addressed to her and asked  is he 
  doctor says that he is not in danger 
said the countess but as she spoke she raised her 
eyes with a sigh and her gesture a of her 
words   is he can i see him i 
asked the princess   moment princess one moment my 
dear is this his son said the countess turning to 
little nicholas who was coming in with  will be 
room for everybody this is a big house oh what 
a lovely boy  the countess took princess mary into 
the drawing room where sonya was talking to mademoiselle the 
countess the boy and the old count came in and 
the princess he had changed very much since princess mary 
had last seen him then he had been a cheerful 
self old man now he seemed a person while talking 
to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking 
everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the 
of moscow and of his property thrown out of his 
accustomed he seemed to have lost the sense of his 
own and to feel that there was no longer a 
place for him in life  in spite of her 
one desire to see her brother as soon as possible 
and her vexation that at the moment when all she 
wanted was to see him they should be trying to 
entertain her and to her the princess noticed all that 
was going on around her and felt the necessity of 
for a time to this new order of things which 
she had entered she knew it to be necessary and 
though it was hard for her she was not vexed 
with these people   is my niece said the 
count sonya don know her princess  princess mary turned 
to sonya and trying to the feeling that in her 
toward the girl she kissed her but she felt by 
the fact that the mood of everyone around her was 
so far from what was in her own heart  
 is he she asked again addressing them all  
 is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing 
 have sent to ask i think you must be 
tired princess  tears of vexation showed themselves in princess 
mary eyes she turned away and was about to ask 
the countess again how to go to him when light 
and steps were heard at the door the princess looked 
round and saw natasha coming in almost running natasha whom 
she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow 
long since  but hardly had the princess looked at 
natasha face before she realized that here was a real 
in her and a friend she ran to meet her 
embraced her and began to cry on her shoulder  
as soon as natasha sitting at the head of prince 
andrew bed heard of princess mary arrival she softly left 
his room and hastened to her with those steps that 
had sounded to princess mary  there was only one 
expression on her agitated face when she ran into the 
drawing room of love love for him for her and 
for all that was near to the man she loved 
and of pity suffering for others and passionate desire to 
give herself entirely to helping them it was plain that 
at that moment there was in natasha heart no thought 
of herself or of her own relations with prince andrew 
 princess mary with her understood all this at the 
first glance at natasha face and wept on her shoulder 
with pleasure   come to him mary said natasha 
leading her into the other room  princess mary raised 
her head her eyes and turned to natasha she felt 
that from her she would be able to understand and 
learn everything   she began her question but stopped 
short  she felt that it was impossible to ask 
or to answer in words natasha face and eyes would 
have to tell her all more clearly and  natasha 
was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt 
whether to say all she knew or not she seemed 
to feel that before those eyes which into the very 
of her heart it was impossible not to tell the 
whole truth which she saw and suddenly natasha lips ugly 
wrinkles gathered round her mouth and her face with her 
hands she burst into  princess mary understood  but 
she still and asked in words she herself did not 
  how is his wound what is his general 
condition   you will see was all natasha could 
say  they sat a little while downstairs near his 
room till they had left off crying and were able 
to go to him with calm faces   has 
his whole illness gone is it long since he grew 
worse when did this happen princess mary inquired  natasha 
told her that at first there had been danger from 
his condition and the he but at that had passed 
and the doctor had only been afraid of that danger 
had also passed when they reached the wound had to 
 knew all about such things as and the doctor 
had said that the might take a course then set 
in but the doctor had said the was not very 
serious   two days ago this suddenly happened said 
natasha with her  don know why but you will 
see what he is like   he asked the 
princess   it not that but worse you will 
see o mary he is too good he cannot cannot 
live because      chapter xv  
 when natasha opened prince andrew door with a familiar 
movement and let princess mary pass into the room before 
her the princess felt the in her hard as she 
had tried to prepare herself and now tried to remain 
she knew that she would be unable to look at 
him without tears  the princess understood what natasha had 
meant by the words  days ago this suddenly happened 
she understood those words to mean that he had suddenly 
and that this and were signs of approaching death as 
she stepped to the door she already saw in andrew 
face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle face 
which he had shown and which therefore affected her very 
strongly she was sure he would speak soft tender words 
to her such as her father had uttered before his 
death and that she would not be able to bear 
it and would burst into in his presence yet sooner 
or later it had to be and she went in 
the rose higher and higher in her as she more 
and more clearly distinguished his form and her eyes tried 
to make out his features and then she saw his 
face and met his  he was lying in a 
squirrel gown on a by he was thin and pale 
in one thin white hand he held a handkerchief while 
with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had 
grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at them 
as they entered  on seeing his face and meeting 
his eyes princess mary suddenly she felt her tears dry 
up and her ceased she suddenly felt guilty and grew 
timid on the expression of his face and eyes  
 in what am i to she asked herself and 
his cold stern look replied  you are and thinking 
of the living while i  in the deep that 
seemed to look not but there was an almost expression 
as he slowly regarded his sister and natasha  he 
kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was 
their   are you mary how did you manage 
to get here said he in a voice as calm 
and as his look  had he screamed in that 
would not have struck such horror into princess mary heart 
as the tone of his voice   have you 
brought little nicholas he asked in the same quiet manner 
and with an obvious effort to remember   are 
you now said princess mary herself surprised at what she 
was saying   my dear you must ask the 
doctor he replied and again making an evident effort to 
be affectionate he said with his lips only  words 
clearly did not to his thoughts   chere d 
         you 
for coming my dear   princess mary pressed his 
hand the pressure made him just perceptibly he was silent 
and she did not know what to say she now 
understood what had happened to him two days before in 
his words his tone and especially in that calm almost 
look could be felt an from everything belonging to this 
world terrible in one who is evidently only with an 
effort did he understand anything living but it was obvious 
that he failed to understand not because he lacked the 
power to do so but because he understood something else 
the living did not and could not understand which occupied 
his mind   you see how fate has brought 
us together said he breaking the silence and pointing to 
natasha  looks after me all the time  princess 
mary heard him and did not understand how he could 
say such a thing he the tender prince andrew how 
could he say that before her whom he loved and 
who loved him had he expected to live he could 
not have said those words in that offensively cold tone 
if he had not known that he was dying how 
could he have failed to pity her and how could 
he speak like that in her presence the only was 
that he was indifferent because something else much more important 
had been revealed to him  the conversation was cold 
and and continually broke off   came by way 
of said natasha  prince andrew did not notice that 
she called his sister mary and only after calling her 
so in his presence did natasha notice it herself  
 he asked   told her that all moscow 
has been down and that  natasha stopped it was 
impossible to talk it was plain that he was making 
an effort to listen but could not do so  
 they say it he said  a great pity 
and he gazed straight before him stroking his mustache with 
his fingers   so you have met count nicholas 
mary prince andrew suddenly said evidently wishing to speak to 
them  wrote here that he took a great to 
you he went on simply and evidently unable to understand 
all the his words had for living people  you 
liked him too it would be a good thing for 
you to get married he added rather more quickly as 
if pleased at having found words he had long been 
 princess mary heard his words but they had no 
meaning for her except as a of how far away 
he now was from everything living   talk of 
me she said quietly and glanced at natasha  natasha 
who felt her glance did not look at her all 
three were again silent   would you like princess 
mary suddenly said in a voice  you like to 
see little nicholas he is always talking about you  
prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time 
but princess mary who knew his face so well saw 
with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or 
affection for his son but with quiet gentle irony because 
he thought she was trying what she believed to be 
the last means of him   i shall be 
very glad to see him is he quite well  
when little nicholas was brought into prince andrew room he 
looked at his father with frightened eyes but did not 
cry because no one else was crying prince andrew kissed 
him and evidently did not know what to say to 
him  when nicholas had been led away princess mary 
again went up to her brother kissed him and unable 
to restrain her tears any longer began to cry  
he looked at her attentively   it about nicholas 
he asked  princess mary nodded her head weeping  
 you know the but he broke off   
did you say   you cry here he said 
looking at her with the same cold expression   
when princess mary began to cry he understood that she 
was crying at the thought that little nicholas would be 
left without a father with a great effort he tried 
to return to life and to see things from their 
point of   to them it must seem sad 
he thought  how simple it is   of 
the air not neither do they yet your father them 
he said to himself and wished to say to princess 
mary  no they will take it their own way 
they won understand they can understand that all those they 
so our all those ideas that seem so important to 
us are unnecessary we cannot understand one another and he 
remained silent   prince andrew little son was seven 
he could scarcely read and knew nothing after that day 
he lived through many things gaining knowledge observation and experience 
but had he possessed all the he afterwards he could 
not have had a better or more profound understanding of 
the meaning of the scene he had between his father 
mary and natasha than he had then he understood it 
completely and leaving the room without crying went silently up 
to natasha who had come out with him and looked 
at her with his beautiful thoughtful eyes then his rosy 
upper lip trembled and his head against her he began 
to cry  after that he and the countess who 
him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess 
mary or to natasha of whom he seemed even than 
of his aunt and clung to them quietly and  
when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood 
what natasha face had told her she did not speak 
any more to natasha of of his life she took 
with her beside his sofa and did not cry any 
more but continually turning in soul to that and whose 
presence above the dying man was now so evident  
    chapter xvi   not only 
did prince andrew know he would die but he felt 
that he was dying and was already half dead he 
was conscious of an from everything earthly and a strange 
and joyous of without or agitation he what was coming 
that and the presence of which he had felt continually 
all his life now near to him and by the 
strange he experienced almost and   he had feared 
the end he had twice experienced that fear of death 
end now he no longer understood that fear   
he had felt it for the first time when the 
like a top before him and he looked at the 
field the and the sky and knew that he was 
face to face with death when he came to himself 
after being and the flower of love had instantly itself 
in his soul as if from the of life that 
had it he no longer feared death and ceased to 
think about it  during the hours of suffering and 
partial he spent after he was the more deeply he 
into the new of love revealed to him the more 
he himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody 
and always to sacrifice for love meant not to love 
anyone not to live this earthly life and the more 
he became with that of love the more he life 
and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful which the 
of such love between life and death when during those 
first days he remembered that he would have to die 
he said to himself  what of it so much 
the better  but after the night in when half 
he had seen her for whom he appear before him 
and having pressed her hand to his lips had gentle 
happy tears love for a particular woman again into his 
heart and once more him to life and joyful and 
agitating thoughts began to his mind the moment at the 
when he had seen kuragin he could not now the 
feeling he then had but was tormented by the question 
whether kuragin was and he dared not  his illness 
its course but what natasha to when she said  
suddenly happened had occurred two days before princess mary arrived 
it was the last between life and death in which 
death gained the it was the of the fact that 
he still life as to him in the form of 
his love for natasha and a last though attack of 
before the  it was evening as usual after dinner 
he was slightly and his thoughts were clear sonya was 
sitting by the table he began to suddenly a feeling 
of happiness seized him   she has come thought 
he  and so it was in sonya place sat 
natasha who had just come in  since she had 
looking after him he had always experienced this consciousness of 
her she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways the 
light of the from him and was a she had 
learned to stockings since prince andrew had mentioned that no 
one the so well as old who stockings and that 
there is something in the of stockings the lightly in 
her slender rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see 
the thoughtful of her drooping face she moved and the 
ball rolled off her knees she started glanced round at 
him and the with her hand stooped carefully with a 
and movement picked up the ball and her former position 
 he looked at her without moving and saw that 
she wanted to draw a deep after but refrained from 
doing so and  at the they had spoken of 
the past and he had told her that if he 
lived he would always thank god for his wound which 
had brought them together again but after that they never 
spoke of the future   it or can it 
not be he now thought as he looked at her 
and listened to the light of the  fate have 
brought me to her so only for me to die 
is it possible that the truth of life has been 
revealed to me only to show me that i have 
spent my life in i love her more than anything 
in the world but what am i to do if 
i love her he thought and he from a habit 
during his sufferings  on hearing that sound natasha put 
down the leaned nearer to him and suddenly noticing his 
shining eyes stepped lightly up to him and bent over 
him   are not   i have been 
looking at you a long time i felt you come 
in no one else gives me that sense of soft 
that you do that light i want to for joy 
 natasha drew closer to him her face shone with 
rapturous joy   i love you too much more 
than anything in the world   i turned away 
for an instant  too much she asked   
too much well what do you what do you feel 
in your soul your whole soul i live what do 
you think   am sure of it sure natasha 
almost shouted taking hold of both his hands with a 
passionate movement  he remained silent   good it 
would be and taking her hand he kissed it  
natasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that 
this would not do and that he had to be 
quiet   you have not she said her joy 
 to sleep please  he pressed her hand and 
it and she went back to the and sat down 
again in her former position twice she turned and looked 
at him and her eyes met his beaming at her 
she set herself a task on her and not to 
turn round till it was finished  soon he really 
his eyes and fell he did not sleep long and 
suddenly with a start and in a cold  as 
he fell he had still been thinking of the subject 
that now always occupied his mind life and death and 
chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it  
 what is love he thought   death love 
is life all everything that i understand i understand only 
because i love everything is everything only because i love 
everything is by it alone love is god and to 
die means that i a of love shall return to 
the general and these thoughts seemed to him comforting but 
they were only thoughts something was in them they were 
not clear they were too one and and there was 
the former agitation and he fell  he that he 
was lying in the room he really was in but 
that he was quite well and many indifferent and insignificant 
people appeared before him he talked to them and discussed 
something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere prince 
andrew realized that all this was trivial and that he 
had more important cares but he continued to speak surprising 
them by empty gradually all these persons began to and 
a single question that of the closed door all else 
he rose and went to the door to and lock 
it everything on whether he was or was not in 
time to lock it he went and tried to but 
his legs refused to move and he knew he would 
not be in time to lock the door though he 
strained all his he was seized by an fear and 
that fear was the fear of death it stood behind 
the door but just when he was toward the door 
that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing 
against it and its way in something not human breaking 
in through that door and had to be kept out 
he seized the door making a final effort to hold 
it back lock it was no longer possible his were 
weak and clumsy and the door pushed from behind by 
that opened and closed again  once again it pushed 
from outside his last were vain and both of the 
door opened it entered and it was death and prince 
andrew died  but at the instant he died prince 
andrew remembered that he was and at the very instant 
he died having made an effort he   it 
was death i died up yes death is an and 
all at once it grew light in his soul and 
the that had till then the was lifted from his 
he felt as if till then within him had been 
and that strange did not again leave him  when 
waking in a cold he moved on the natasha went 
up and asked him what was the matter he did 
not answer and looked at her not understanding  that 
was what had happened to him two days before princess 
mary arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it 
the assumed a character but what the doctor said did 
not interest natasha she saw the terrible which to her 
were more  from that day an from life came 
to prince andrew together with his from sleep and to 
the of life it did not seem to him than 
an from sleep to the of a  there was 
nothing terrible or in this  his last days and 
hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both princess 
mary and natasha who did not leave him felt this 
they did not or shudder and during these last days 
they themselves felt that they were not on him  
was no longer there he had left them but on 
what reminded them most of him body both felt this 
so strongly that the and terrible side of death did 
not them and they did not feel it necessary to 
their neither in his presence nor out of it did 
they nor did they ever talk to one another about 
him they felt that they could not express in words 
what they understood  they both saw that he was 
slowly and quietly deeper and deeper away from them and 
they both knew that this had to be so and 
that it was right  he and received everyone came 
to take leave of him when they brought his son 
to him he pressed his lips to the boy and 
turned away not because he felt it hard and sad 
 mary and natasha understood that but simply because he 
thought it was all that was of him but when 
they told him to the boy he did what was 
demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was 
anything else he should do  when the last of 
the body which the spirit was leaving occurred princess mary 
and natasha were present   it over said princess 
mary when his body had for a few minutes growing 
cold before them natasha went up looked at the dead 
eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but 
did not kiss them but clung to that which reminded 
her most nearly of him body   has he 
gone where is he now  when the body washed 
and dressed lay in the on a table everyone came 
to take leave of him and they all wept  
little nicholas cried because his heart was by painful the 
countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because 
he was no more the old count cried because he 
felt that before long he too must take the same 
terrible step  natasha and princess mary also wept now 
but not because of their own they wept with a 
and which had taken of their at the consciousness of 
the simple and solemn of death that had been accomplished 
in their presence      book thirteen 
      chapter i   
man mind cannot the causes of in their but the 
desire to find those causes is in man soul and 
without considering the and of the any one of which 
taken separately may seem to be the cause he at 
the first to a cause that seems to him and 
says  is the cause in  the actions of 
men are the subject of observation the first and most 
to present itself was the will of the and after 
that the will of those who stood in the most 
prominent position of history but we need only to the 
of any lies in the of the general of men 
who take part in it be convinced that the will 
of the hero does not control the actions of the 
but is itself continually it may seem to be a 
matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of this 
way or that yet there is the same difference between 
a man who says that the people of the west 
moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a 
man who says that this happened because it had to 
happen as there is between those who declared that the 
earth was and that the moved round it and those 
who that they did not know what the earth but 
knew there were its movement and that of the other 
there is and can be no cause of an except 
the one cause of all causes but there are and 
some of these are known to us while we are 
conscious of others we cannot the of these is only 
possible when we have quite the to find the cause 
in the will of some one man just as the 
of the of the motion of the was possible only 
when men the of the of the earth  the 
consider that next to the battle of and the occupation 
of moscow by the and its by fire the most 
important of the war of  was the movement of 
the russian army from the to the road and to 
the so march across the river they the glory of 
that of to different men and as to whom the 
honor is even foreign including the french the of the 
russian when they speak of that march but it is 
hard to understand why military and following them others consider 
this march to be the profound of some one man 
who russia and destroyed napoleon in the first place it 
is hard to understand where the and of this movement 
lay for not much mental effort was to see that 
the best position for an army when it is not 
being attacked is where there are most and even a 
dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best 
position for an army after its from moscow in  
was on the road so it is impossible to understand 
by what the reach the that this was a profound 
one and it is even more difficult to understand just 
why they think that this was to save russia and 
the french for this march had it been accompanied or 
followed by other circumstances might have to the russians and 
for the french if the position of the russian army 
really began to from the time of that march it 
does not at all follow that the march was the 
cause of it  that march might not only have 
failed to give any to the russian army but might 
in other circumstances have led to its what would have 
happened had moscow not down if had not lost sight 
of the russians if napoleon had not remained if the 
russian army at had given battle as and what would 
have happened had the french attacked the russians while they 
were the what would have happened if on approaching napoleon 
had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the 
energy he had shown when he attacked them at what 
would have happened had the french moved on petersburg in 
any of these the march that brought might have  
the third and most thing is that people history deliberately 
avoid seeing that this march cannot be to any one 
man that no one ever foresaw it and that in 
like the from it did not itself to anyone in 
its but by moment step by step by an number 
of most circumstances and was only seen in its when 
it had been accomplished and belonged to the past  
at the at the thought in the minds of the 
russian was the one naturally suggesting itself a direct by 
the road in of this there is the fact that 
the of the for such a and above all there 
is the well conversation after the between the commander in 
chief and who was in of the department the commander 
in chief that the army were for the most part 
along the in the and and that if they on 
the army would be from its by the broad river 
which cannot be early in winter this was the first 
indication of the necessity of from what had seemed the 
most natural course direct on the army turned more to 
the south along the road and nearer to its subsequently 
the of the french  even lost sight of the 
russian army for the safety of the at and especially 
the advantages of drawing nearer to its the army to 
turn still further south to the road having over by 
a forced march to the road the the russian intended 
to remain at and had no thought of the position 
but circumstances and the of french who had for a 
time lost touch with the russians and of giving battle 
and above all the of in our army to turn 
still more to the south and to cross from the 
to the road and go to which was between the 
along which those lay just as it is impossible to 
say when it was decided to moscow so it is 
impossible to say precisely when or by whom it was 
decided to move to only when the army had got 
there as the result of and forces did people begin 
to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and 
long ago its result      chapter 
ii   the famous movement merely in this after 
the of the french had ceased the russian army which 
had been continually straight back from the from that direct 
course and not finding itself was naturally drawn toward the 
where were  if instead of to ourselves of leading 
the russian army we picture that army without any it 
could not have done anything but make a return movement 
toward moscow an in the direction where most were to 
be found and where the country was  that movement 
from the to the and was so natural that even 
the russian moved in that direction and were sent from 
petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way at 
kutuzov received what was almost a from the emperor for 
having moved his army along the road and the emperor 
letter indicated to him the very position he had already 
occupied near  having rolled like a ball in the 
direction of the given by the whole and by the 
battle of the russian army the strength of that was 
exhausted and no fresh was received the position natural to 
it  kutuzov lay not in any of as it 
is called but in the fact that he alone understood 
the of what had happened he alone then understood the 
meaning of the french army he alone continued to that 
the battle of had been a he alone as commander 
in chief might have been expected to be eager to 
attack his whole strength to restrain the russian army from 
 the at was lying where the had left him 
but whether he was still whether he was strong and 
merely lying low the did not know suddenly the was 
heard to  the of that  french army which 
its condition was the sending of to kutuzov with for 
peace  napoleon with his usual assurance that entered his 
head was right wrote to kutuzov the first words that 
occurred to him though they were meaningless   monsieur 
le prince i am sending one of my adjutants to 
discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your to 
what he says to you especially when he the of 
and special regard i have long for your person this 
letter having no other object i god monsieur le prince 
to keep you in his and gracious  napoleon  
moscow     kutuzov replied  should be 
by were i looked on as the of a of 
any sort such is the present spirit of my nation 
but he continued to all his to restrain his from 
 during the month that the french were in moscow 
and the russian were quietly at a change had taken 
place in the strength of the two in spirit and 
in number a result of which the superiority had passed 
to the russian side though the condition and of the 
french army were to the russians as soon as that 
change occurred the need of at once showed itself by 
signs these signs were the of at the reports coming 
in from all sides of the and of the french 
the flow of to our the fine weather the long 
rest the russian soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to 
do what they had been assembled for which usually shows 
itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as 
to what the french army so long lost sight of 
was doing the boldness with which our now close up 
to the french at the news of easy gained by 
and over the french the by this the desire for 
that lay in the heart of every russian as long 
as the french were in moscow and  all a 
consciousness in every mind that the strength of the had 
changed and that the was now on our side there 
was a change in the strength and an had become 
and at once as a clock to and as soon 
as the minute hand has a full circle this change 
was shown by an and in the higher   
   chapter iii   the russian army 
was by kutuzov and his staff and also by the 
emperor from petersburg before the news of the of moscow 
had been received in petersburg a plan of the whole 
had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his 
though this plan had been drawn up on the that 
moscow was still in our hands it was by the 
staff and as a for kutuzov only replied that movements 
arranged from a distance were always difficult to so fresh 
were sent for the of difficulties that might be as 
well as fresh people who were to watch kutuzov actions 
and report upon them  besides this the whole staff 
of the russian army was now the left vacant by 
who had been killed and by who had gone away 
in had to be filled very serious consideration was given 
to the question whether it would be better to put 
a in place and in d or on the contrary 
to put d in a place and so on if 
anything more than a or satisfaction on this  as 
a result of the between kutuzov and his chief of 
staff the presence of confidential of the emperor and these 
a more than usually play of parties was going on 
among the staff of the army a was d was 
and so on in all possible and in all these 
the subject of was generally the conduct of the war 
which all these men believed they were but this affair 
of the war went on of them as it had 
to go that is never in the way people but 
always from the essential attitude of the only in the 
highest did all these and appear to be a true 
of what had to happen   prince michael ilarionovich 
 the emperor on the second of in a letter 
that reached kutuzov after the battle at since  moscow 
has been in the hands of the your last reports 
were written on the and during all this time not 
only has no been taken against the or for the 
relief of the capital but to your last report you 
have even farther is already occupied by an and with 
its famous so to the army is in danger from 
general wintzingerode reports i see that an corps of ten 
thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps 
of several thousand men is moving on a third has 
along the road and a fourth rather considerable is between 
and napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the 
twenty in of all this information when the has his 
forces in large and with napoleon and his guards in 
moscow is it possible that the forces you are so 
considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive 
on the contrary he is probably you with or at 
most with an army corps much than the army to 
you it would seem that availing yourself of these circumstances 
you might attack a one and him or at least 
him to in our hands an important part of the 
now occupied by the and danger from and other in 
the you will be if the is able to direct 
a force of any size against petersburg to this capital 
in which it has not been possible to many for 
with the army to you and with resolution and energy 
you have means to this fresh remember that you have 
still to answer to our offended country for the of 
moscow you have experienced my to reward you that will 
not in me but i and russia have a right 
to expect from you all the and success which your 
military talent and the courage of the you command justify 
us in expecting   but by the time this 
letter which that the real relation of the forces had 
already made itself felt in petersburg was kutuzov had found 
himself unable any longer to restrain the army he from 
and a battle had taken place  on the second 
of a cossack who was out killed one and another 
following the he made his way far into the forest 
and came upon the left of army there without any 
the cossack told his comrades how he had almost into 
the hands of the french a cornet hearing the story 
his commander  the cossack was sent for and the 
cossack officers wished to take of this to some horses 
but one of the superior officers who was acquainted with 
the higher the to a general on the staff the 
state of things on the staff had of late been 
exceedingly strained had been to see a few days and 
had him to use his influence with the commander in 
chief to him to take the offensive   i 
did not know you i should think you did not 
want what you are asking for i need only advise 
anything and his is sure to do the opposite replied 
 the cossack report by horse who were sent out 
was the final that had the tightly spring was the 
clock began to and the to play despite all his 
power his his experience and his knowledge of men kutuzov 
taken into consideration the cossack report a note from who 
sent reports to the emperor the wishes he the emperor 
to hold and the fact that all the expressed the 
same wish no longer check the movement and gave the 
order to do what he regarded as and his approval 
that is to the accomplished fact     
 chapter iv   note and the cossack information 
that the left of the french was were merely final 
that it was necessary to order an attack and it 
was fixed for the of  on the morning of 
the fourth of kutuzov the read them to asking him 
to attend to the further   right right i 
haven time just now replied and left the  the 
drawn up by were very good as in the it 
was written not in german this time   first 
will march here and here  second will march there 
and there and so on and on paper all these 
arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed 
the everything had been thought out as is usual in 
and as is always the case not a single reached 
its place at the appointed time  when the necessary 
number of of the had been prepared an officer was 
and sent to them to to deal with a young 
officer of the horse guards kutuzov pleased at the importance 
of the to him went to   away said 
 the officer of the horse guards went to a 
general with whom was often to be found   
and the general out too  the officer his horse 
off to someone else   he gone out  
 only they don make me for this delay what 
a it is thought the officer and he round the 
whole one man said he had seen ride past with 
some other others said he must have returned home the 
officer till six o in the evening without even stopping 
to eat was nowhere to be found and no one 
knew where he was the officer a little food at 
a and again to the to find too was away 
but here he was told that he had gone to 
a ball at general and that was probably there too 
  where is it   there over at 
said a cossack officer pointing to a country house in 
the far distance   outside our line   
put two as and they having such a there it 
awful two and three sets of  the officer out 
our lines to while still at a distance he heard 
as he the merry sounds of a dance song from 
the house   the in the he heard accompanied 
by and the sound of a drowned every now and 
then by shouts these sounds made his rise but at 
the same time he was afraid that he would be 
for not having sooner the important order to him it 
was already past eight o he and went up into 
the porch of a large country house which had remained 
between the russian and french forces in the room and 
the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and groups 
of stood outside the the officer was and immediately saw 
all the chief of the army together and among them 
big figure they all had their and were standing in 
a with flushed and animated faces laughing loudly in the 
middle of the room a short handsome general with a 
red face was dancing the with much spirit and  
 nicholas  the officer felt that by with important 
orders at such a moment he was to and he 
would have to wait but one of the him and 
hearing what he had come about  came forward with 
a frown on his face and hearing what the officer 
had to say took the papers from him without a 
word    think he went off just by 
said a who was on the staff that evening to 
the officer of the horse guards referring to  was 
a trick it was done on purpose to get into 
trouble you see what a mess there be tomorrow  
    chapter v   next day 
the kutuzov having given orders to be called early said 
his dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness of having to 
direct a battle he did not of got into his 
and drove from  village three and a half from 
to the place where the were to meet he sat 
in the and waking up by and listening for any 
sound of on the right as an indication that the 
had but all was still quiet a dull morning was 
just on approaching kutuzov noticed leading their horses to water 
across the road along which he was kutuzov looked at 
them stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment they belonged 
to they belonged to a that should have been far 
in front and in ambush long before then  may 
be a mistake thought the old commander in chief but 
a little further on he saw infantry with their arms 
and the soldiers only dressed their and carrying he sent 
for an officer the officer that no order to had 
been received   not kutuzov began but checked himself 
immediately and sent for a senior officer getting out of 
his he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily pacing 
silently up and down when the officer of the general 
staff whom he had appeared kutuzov went in the face 
not because that officer was to for the mistake but 
because he was an object of sufficient importance for him 
to his on and the old man fell into that 
state of in which he sometimes used to on the 
ground and he fell upon threatening him with his hands 
shouting and him with another man captain who happened to 
turn up and who was not at all to the 
same fate   sort of another are you i 
have you kutuzov in a voice his arms and  
he was suffering physically he the commander in chief a 
serene who everybody said possessed such as no man had 
ever had in russia to be placed in this position 
the of the whole army  have been in such 
a to about today or have kept thinking everything over 
all night thought he to himself  i was a 
of an officer no one would have dared to me 
so and now he was in a state of suffering 
as if from and could not avoid expressing it by 
of anger and distress but his strength soon began to 
him and looking about him conscious of having said much 
that was he again got into his and drove back 
in silence  his once did not return and feebly 
he listened to and self  did not come to 
see him till the next day and to the of 
and that the movement that had should be next day 
and once more kutuzov had to consent    
  chapter vi   next day the assembled 
in their appointed places in the evening and during the 
night it was an night with dark but no rain 
the ground was but not and the only occasionally a 
of the could be heard the men were to talk 
out loud to smoke their pipes or to a light 
and they tried to prevent their horses the of the 
its and they gaily some they had reached their arms 
and settled down on the cold ground but the all 
night and arrived at places where they evidently should not 
have been  only count orlov with his  least 
important of all got to his appointed place at the 
right time this at the of a forest on the 
path leading from the village of to  toward dawn 
count orlov who had off was by a from the 
french army being brought to him this was a of 
corps who explained in that he had come over because 
he had been in the service that he ought long 
ago to have been made an officer that he was 
than any of them and so he had left them 
and wished to pay them out he said that was 
spending the night less than a mile from where they 
were and that if they would let him have a 
of a hundred men he would him count orlov his 
fellow officers  the was too to be refused everyone 
to go and everybody making the after much and arguing 
major with two cossack decided to go with the  
 remember said count orlov to the at  you 
have been lying i have you like a dog but 
if it true you shall have a hundred gold  
without the with a resolute air and away with whose 
men had quickly assembled they into the forest and count 
orlov having seen off returned from the of the early 
dawn and by what he had on his own responsibility 
and began looking at the now just visible in the 
light of dawn and the dying our ought to have 
to appear on an open to his right he looked 
in that direction but though the would have been visible 
quite far off they were not to be seen it 
seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir 
in the french and his adjutant this   it 
is really too late said count orlov looking at the 
 as often happens when someone we have is no 
longer before our eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and 
obvious to him that the was an that he had 
and that the whole russian attack would be by the 
of those two which he would lead away heaven only 
knew where how could one a commander in chief from 
among such a of   am sure that was 
lying said the count   can still be called 
back said one of his who like count orlov felt 
of the when he looked at the   really 
what do you think should we let them go on 
or not   you have them back   
them back them back said count orlov with looking at 
his watch  will be too late it is quite 
light  and the adjutant through the forest after when 
returned count orlov both by the and by awaiting the 
infantry that still did not appear as well as by 
the of the to all his men felt the same 
excitement   he in a whisper the men took 
their places and themselves  with god   in 
the forest and the cossack their and one after another 
as if out of a dashed gaily across the brook 
toward the  one desperate frightened from the first french 
who saw the and all who were in the and 
only just waking up ran off in all directions and 
horses  had the the french without heeding what was 
behind and around them they would have captured and everything 
there that was what the officers desired but it was 
impossible to make the when once they had got and 
prisoners none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners 
and thirty were taken on the spot besides and  
seemed most important to the horses and the like all 
this had to be with the prisoners and the divided 
without some shouting and even a little among themselves it 
was on this that the all themselves  the french 
not being farther began to themselves they formed into and 
began orlov still waiting for the other to arrive no 
further  to the which said that  first will 
march and so on the infantry of the by and 
by had started in order and as always happens had 
got somewhere but not to their appointed places as always 
happens the men starting began to halt were heard there 
was a sense of and finally a backward movement adjutants 
and about shouted grew angry said they had come quite 
wrong and were late gave to a little and at 
last gave it all up and went forward simply to 
get somewhere  shall get somewhere or other and they 
did indeed get somewhere though not to their right places 
a few even got to their right place but too 
late to be of any use and only in time 
to be at who in this battle played the part 
of at from place to place finding everything down everywhere 
thus he on corps in a wood when it was 
already broad though the corps should long before have joined 
orlov and vexed by the and that someone must be 
for it up to the commander of the corps and 
began him severely saying that he ought to be general 
a old of being also upset by all the delay 
and cross fell into a to everybody surprise and quite 
contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to 
  not to take lessons from anyone but i 
can die with my men as well as anybody he 
said and with a single  coming out onto a 
field under the fire this general went straight leading his 
men under fire without considering in his agitation whether going 
into now with a single would be of any use 
or no danger balls and were just what he in 
his angry mood one of the first killed him and 
other killed many of his men and his remained under 
fire for some time quite      
chapter vii   meanwhile another was to have attacked 
the french from the front but kutuzov accompanied that he 
well knew that nothing but would come of this battle 
against his will and as far as was in his 
power held the back he did not  he silently 
on his small gray horse answering that they should attack 
  word attack is always on your tongue but 
you don see that we are unable to said he 
to who asked to   couldn take this morning 
or get to the place in time and nothing can 
be done now he replied to someone else  when 
kutuzov was that at the french to the reports of 
the there had been were now two of he gave 
a glance at who was behind him and to whom 
he had not spoken since the previous day   
see they are asking to attack and making of all 
kinds but as soon as one gets to business nothing 
is ready and the takes  screwed up his eyes 
and smiled on hearing these words he understood that for 
him the had over and that kutuzov would himself with 
that   having a little fun at my said 
softly with his knee who was at his side  
soon after this moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked 
  is not too late yet your has not 
gone away you were to order an attack if not 
the guards will not so much as see a little 
smoke  kutuzov did not reply but when they to 
him that were in he ordered an though at every 
hundred he for three of an hour  the whole 
battle in what orlov had done the rest of the 
army merely lost some of men  in of this 
battle kutuzov received a diamond and some diamonds and a 
hundred thousand rubles others also received pleasant to their and 
following the battle fresh were made in the staff  
 how everything is done with us all said the 
russian officers and after the battle letting it be understood 
that some fool there is doing things all wrong but 
that we ourselves should not have done so just as 
people speak today but people who talk like that either 
do not know what they are talking about or deliberately 
themselves no battle or place as those who it that 
is an essential condition  a number of free forces 
 nowhere is man than during a battle where it 
is a question of life and death influence the course 
taken by the fight and that course never can be 
known in and never with the direction of any one 
force  if many and forces act on a given 
body the direction of its motion cannot with any one 
of those forces but will always be a mean in 
is by the of a of forces  if in 
the given by especially french ones we find their wars 
and carried out in with formed the only to be 
drawn is that those are  the battle of obviously 
did not the aim had in lead the into in 
the order by the nor that which count orlov may 
have had in take nor the result of immediately the 
whole corps which and others may have had in nor 
the aim of the officer who wished to go into 
to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who wanted 
more than he got and so on but if the 
aim of the battle was what and what all the 
russians of that day desired drive the french out of 
russia and their army is quite clear that the battle 
of just because of its was exactly what was wanted 
at that of the it would be difficult and even 
impossible to imagine any result more than the of this 
battle with a of effort and insignificant despite the greatest 
the most important of the whole were the from to 
an of the weakness of the french and the of 
that which napoleon army had only to begin its flight 
     chapter viii   napoleon 
moscow after the brilliant de la there can be no 
doubt about the for the remains in the hands of 
the french the russians and their capital moscow in arms 
and wealth is in napoleon hands the russian army only 
half the strength of the french does not make a 
single to attack for a whole month napoleon position is 
most brilliant he can either fall on the russian army 
with its strength and it an advantageous peace or in 
case of a make a menacing move on petersburg or 
even in the case of a reverse return to or 
or remain in moscow in short no special would seem 
to be to the brilliant position the french held at 
that time for that only very simple and easy steps 
were necessary not to allow the to to prepare winter 
which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole army 
to the of which  to the french there were 
enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six 
months yet napoleon that greatest of all who the had 
control of the army took none of these steps  
he not merely did nothing of the kind but on 
the contrary he used his power to the most foolish 
and of all the open to him of all that 
napoleon might have done in moscow on petersburg or on 
or by a more or more  by the road 
kutuzov afterwards took nothing more stupid or can be imagined 
than what he did he remained in moscow till letting 
the the city then whether to leave a behind him 
he moscow approached kutuzov without joining battle turned to the 
right and reached again without to break through and take 
the road kutuzov took but instead to along the road 
nothing more stupid than that could have been or more 
for the army as the showed had napoleon aim been 
to his army the most could hardly have any of 
actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose of 
anything the russian army might do  napoleon the man 
of did this but to say that he destroyed his 
army because he wished to or because he was very 
stupid would be as as to say that he had 
brought his to moscow because he wished to and because 
he was very clever and a  in both his 
having no more force than the of any merely with 
the that the  the quite represent napoleon as having 
in moscow and do so only because the did not 
justify his actions he employed all his ability and strength 
to do the best he could for himself and his 
army as he had done and as he did subsequently 
in  his at that time was no less than 
it was in in in austria and in prussia we 
do not know for certain in how far his was 
genuine in forty looked down upon his his great there 
are all told us by we cannot his in austria 
or prussia for we have to draw our information from 
french or german and the of whole corps without and 
of without a must to recognize his as the only 
of the war carried on in germany but we thank 
god have no need to recognize his in order to 
hide our shame we have paid for the right to 
look at the matter plainly and simply and we will 
not that right  his in moscow was as and 
as full of as order after order and plan after 
plan were by him from the time he entered moscow 
till the time he left it the of and of 
a and even the burning of moscow did not him 
he did not lose sight either of the welfare of 
his army or of the of the or of the 
welfare of the people of russia or of the direction 
of affairs in paris or of the terms of the 
peace      chapter ix   
with regard to military matters napoleon immediately on his into 
moscow gave general orders to observe the movements of the 
russian army sent army corps out along the different and 
to find kutuzov then he gave directions about the of 
the and drew up a brilliant plan for a future 
over the whole map of russia  with regard to 
questions napoleon captain who had been and was in and 
did not know how to get out of moscow explained 
to him his whole and his magnanimity and having written 
a letter to the emperor alexander in which he considered 
it his duty to inform his friend and brother that 
had managed affairs badly in moscow he to petersburg

means by an act worthy of himself and of the 
french army he let relief be distributed to those who 
had been out but as food was too precious to 
be given to who were for the most part napoleon 
to supply them with money with which to food from 
outside and had paper rubles distributed to them  with 
reference to army orders were continually being to severe for 
the of military duties and to suppress robbery

say all these and were not at all worse than 
others in circumstances not the of the matter but like 
the hands of a clock from the swung about in

he left moscow a child wants the floor on which 
he has hurt himself to be the of the russian

the french lost touch with the russian army of thousand 
men and to it was only found like a lost

because the and actresses were  even did not have 
the desired effect the genuine as well as the paper 
money which moscow lost its value the french collecting cared 
only for gold not only was the paper money which 
napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate but even silver 
lost its value in relation to gold  but the 
most example of the of the orders given by the 
at that time was napoleon to stop the and  
this is what the army were   in the 
city despite the against it order is not yet restored

ought to be by a strong force    
emperor is that despite the orders to stop parties of 
guards are continually seen returning to the among the old 
and were more than ever yesterday evening last night and 
today the emperor with regret that the picked soldiers appointed 
to his person who should set an example of carry 
to such a point that they break into the and 
army others have themselves to the of and officers and 
have and them   grand of the wrote the 
 bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers 
continue to commit in all the and even under the 
very of the emperor  that army like a of 
cattle run wild and the which might have it from 
and perished with each day it remained in moscow but 
it did not go away  it began to run 
away only when suddenly seized by a by the of 
on the road and by the battle of the news 
of that battle of unexpectedly received by napoleon at a 
evoked in him a desire to the russians  says 
and he the order for which the whole army was 
 from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they 
had napoleon too carried away his own but on seeing 
the that the army he was  says horror and 
yet with his experience of war he did not order 
all the to be as he had done with those 
of a certain when approaching moscow he gazed at the 
and carriages in which soldiers were and remarked that it 
was a very good thing as those could be used 
to carry the and the  the of the whole 
army that of a animal which it is and does 
not know what it is doing to study the and 
of napoleon and his army from the time it entered 
moscow till it was destroyed is like the dying and 
of a animal very often a animal hearing a rustle 
straight at the forward and back again and hastens its 
own end napoleon under pressure from his whole army did 
the same thing the rustle of the battle of frightened 
the and it rushed forward onto the reached him turned 
back and finally any wild back along the most and 
dangerous path where the old was familiar  during the 
whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to 
have been the of all these movements the of a 
ship may seem to a to the like a child 
who holding a of inside a carriage thinks he is 
it      chapter xi   
early in the morning of the of pierre went out 
of the and on returning stopped by the door to 
play with a little blue dog with a long body 
and short legs that jumped about him this little dog 
lived in their beside at night it sometimes made into 
the town but always returned again probably it had never 
had an and it still belonged to and had no 
name the french called it the who told stories called 
it and others called it gray or sometimes its lack 
of a a name or even of a or any 
definite color did not seem to trouble the blue dog 
in the least its tail stood up firm and round 
as a plume its legs served it so well that 
it would often gracefully lift a and run very easily 
and quickly on three legs as if to use all 
four everything pleased it now it would on its back 
with now in the sun with a thoughtful air of 
importance and now about playing with a of wood or 
a straw  pierre by now of a dirty shirt 
 only of his former a pair of which by 
advice he tied with string round the for and a 
coat and cap physically he had changed much during this 
time he no longer seemed stout though he still had 
the appearance of and strength in his family a and 
mustache covered the lower part of his face and a 
of hair with round his head like a cap the 
look of his eyes was resolute calm and as never 
before the former which had shown itself even in his 
eyes was now replaced by an for and his feet 
were bare  pierre first looked down the field across 
which and were passing that morning then into the distance 
across the river then at the dog who was to 
be in about him and then at his bare feet 
which he placed with pleasure in positions moving his dirty 
thick big every time he looked at his bare feet 
a smile of animated self across his face the sight 
of them reminded him of all he had experienced and 
learned during these and this was pleasant to him  
for some days the weather had been calm and clear 
with slight in the is called an  summer  
in the the air was warm and that was particularly 
pleasant with the of the morning still in the air 
 on everything and near the crystal seen only at 
that time of the sparrow hills were visible in the 
distance with the village the and the large white house 
the bare the sand the and of the the green 
and the corners of the white house in the distance 
all stood out in the air in most delicate and 
with unnatural near by could be seen the familiar of 
a half occupied by the french with still showing dark 
green beside the and even that and house in dull 
weather was ugly quietly beautiful now in the clear  
a french with coat in a way a on his 
head and a short pipe in his mouth came from 
behind a corner of the and approached pierre with a 
friendly   monsieur  name for pierre  just 
like spring  and the leaned against the door and 
offered pierre his pipe though whenever he offered it pierre 
always declined it   be on the march in 
such weather he began  pierre inquired what was being 
said about leaving and the told him that nearly all 
the were starting and there ought to be an order 
about the prisoners that day one of the soldiers in 
the with pierre was dying and pierre told the that 
something should be done about him the replied that pierre 
need not about that as they had an and a 
hospital and would be made for the and that in 
general everything that could happen had been by the  
 monsieur you have only to say a word to 
the captain you know he is a man who never 
anything speak to the captain when he makes his round 
he will do anything for you   captain of 
whom the spoke often had long with pierre and showed 
him all sorts of favors   see st he 
said to me the other day  is a man 
of education who french he is a russian who has 
had but he is a man he knows what what 
if he wants anything and asks me he won get 
a when one has studied you see one education and 
well people it is for your sake i mention it 
monsieur the other day if it had not been for 
you that affair would have ended ill  and after 
a while longer the went away  affair he had 
alluded to had happened a few days before fight between 
the prisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had 
succeeded in his comrades some of the prisoners who had 
heard pierre talking to the immediately asked what the frenchman 
had said while pierre was repeating what he had been 
told about the army leaving moscow a thin sallow tattered 
french came up to the door of the rapidly and 
timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of 
greeting he asked pierre whether the to whom he had 
given a shirt to was in that  a week 
before the french had had and linen to them which 
they had given out to the prisoners to make up 
into and for them   ready dear fellow said 
coming out with a neatly shirt  on account of 
the warm weather and for at work was wearing only 
and a tattered shirt as black as his hair was 
round fashion with a of and his round face seemed 
and than ever   promise is own brother to 
i said and here it is ready said smiling and 
unfolding the shirt he had  the frenchman glanced around 
uneasily and then as if his rapidly threw off his 
uniform and put on the shirt he had a long 
silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin bare body but 
no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on 
would laugh at him and thrust his head into the 
shirt hurriedly none of the prisoners said a word  
 it fits well kept repeating pulling the shirt straight 
 the frenchman having pushed his head and hands through 
without raising his eyes looked down at the shirt and 
examined the   see dear man this is not 
a and i had no proper and as they say 
one a even to kill a said with one of 
his round smiles obviously pleased with his work   
good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french 
 there must be some linen left over   
will fit better still when it sets to your body 
said still admiring his  be nice and comfortable  
 old fellow but the left over said the frenchman 
again and smiled he took out an note and gave 
it to  give me the that are over  
pierre saw that did not want to understand what the 
frenchman was saying and he looked on without thanked the 
frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own 
work the frenchman on having the returned that were left 
over and asked pierre to what he said   
does he want the for said  make fine for 
us well never mind  and with a suddenly changed 
and expression took a small of from inside his shirt 
and gave it to the frenchman without looking at him 
 dear muttered and went away the frenchman looked at 
the linen considered for a moment then looked inquiringly at 
pierre and as if pierre look had told him something 
suddenly blushed and shouted in a voice   eh 
keep them yourself and back the he turned and went 
out   look at that said swaying his head 
 said they were not but they too have it 
what the old used to say  hand an open 
hand a dry hand close he but yet he given 
it back  smiled and was silent looking at the 
  they make grand dear friend he said and 
went back into the      chapter 
xii   four had passed since pierre had been 
taken and though the french had offered to move him 
from the men to the officers he had stayed in 
the where he was first put  in and moscow 
pierre experienced almost the extreme of a man can endure 
but to his strength and health of which he had 
till then been and especially to the fact that the 
came so gradually that it was impossible to say when 
they began he endured his position not only lightly but 
joyfully and just at this time he obtained the and 
ease of mind he had in vain to reach he 
had long in different that of mind that inner which 
had so him in the soldiers at the battle of 
he had it in in in the of town life 
in wine in of self and in love for natasha 
he had it by all these and had failed him 
and now without thinking about it he had found that 
peace and inner only through the horror of death through 
and through what he recognized in  those dreadful moments 
he had lived through at the executions had as it 
were forever washed away from his and memory the agitating 
thoughts and that had seemed so important it did not 
now occur to him to think of russia or the 
war or politics or napoleon it was plain to him 
that all these things were no business of his and 
that he was not called on to judge them and 
therefore could not do so  and summer weather are 
not together he thought repeating words of which he found 
consoling his intention of napoleon and his of the number 
of the of the now seemed to him meaningless and 
even his anger with his wife and anxiety that his 
name should not be now seemed not merely trivial but 
even amusing what was it of his that somewhere or 
other that woman was leading the life she what did 
it matter to anybody and especially to him whether or 
not they found out that their name was count bezukhov 
 he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew 
and quite agreed with him though he understood prince andrew 
thoughts differently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness 
could only be but had said it with a of 
and irony as though he was really saying that all 
desire for happiness is in us merely to us and 
never be satisfied but pierre believed it without any mental 
the of suffering the satisfaction of one and freedom in 
the choice of one occupation that is of one way 
of life now seemed to pierre to be man highest 
happiness here and now for the first time he fully 
appreciated the enjoyment of when he wanted to eat drinking 
when he wanted to drink when he wanted to sleep 
of when he was cold of talking to a fellow 
man when he wished to talk and to hear a 
human voice the satisfaction of one food and freedom that 
he was of all this seemed to pierre to happiness 
and the choice of occupation that is of his way 
of life that that was so to him such an 
easy matter that he forgot that a of the of 
life all joy in one while great freedom in the 
choice of occupation freedom as his wealth his education and 
his social position had given him in his own life 
just what makes the choice of occupation difficult and the 
desire and of having an occupation  all pierre now 
turned on the time when he would be free yet 
subsequently and for the rest of his life he thought 
and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of of those 
strong joyful and chiefly of the complete peace of mind 
and inner freedom which he experienced only during those  
when on the first day he got up early went 
out of the at dawn and saw the and of 
the new of the still dark at first the on 
the grass the sparrow hills and the above the river 
in the distance when he felt the of the fresh 
air and heard the noise of the flying from moscow 
across the field and when afterwards light from the east 
and the sun appeared solemnly from behind a cloud and 
the and the the distance and the river all began 
to in the glad light felt a new joy and 
strength in life such as he had never before known 
and this not only stayed with him during the whole 
of his but even grew in strength as the of 
his position  that feeling of and of for anything 
was still further in him by the high opinion his 
fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at 
the with his knowledge of the respect shown him by 
the french his his to give anything asked of him 
 received the of three rubles a week made to 
officers with his strength which he showed to the soldiers 
by pressing into the of the his to his and 
his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything 
 seemed to them he appeared to them a rather 
and superior being the very qualities that had been a 
if not to him in the world he had lived 
in strength his for the of life his absent and 
among these people gave him almost the of a hero 
and pierre felt that their opinion placed upon him  
    chapter xiii   the french 
began on the night between the and of and were 
and and started  at seven in the morning a 
french in wearing and carrying and enormous stood in front 
of the and animated french talk mingled with sounded all 
along the lines  in the everyone was ready dressed 
and only the order to start the pale and thin 
with dark round his eyes alone sat in his place 
and not dressed his eyes prominent from the of his 
face gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no 
attention to him and he and quietly it was evidently 
not so much his sufferings that him to  had 
as his fear and at being left alone  pierre 
with a round his and wearing shoes had made for 
him from some a french had off a tea chest 
and brought to have his with went up to the 
man and down beside him   know they are 
not all going away they have a hospital here you 
may be better off than we others said pierre  
 oh it will be the death of me o 
the man in a louder voice   go and 
ask them again said pierre rising and going to the 
door of the  just as pierre reached the door 
the who had offered him a pipe the day before 
came up to it with two soldiers the and soldiers 
were in with and that had metal and these changed 
their familiar faces  the came to orders to the 
door the prisoners had to be counted before being let 
out   what will they do with the man 
pierre began  but even as he spoke he began 
to doubt whether this was the he knew or a 
stranger so unlike himself did the seem at that moment 
moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp of was 
suddenly heard from both sides the frowned at pierre words 
and uttering some meaningless the door the became and the 
sharp of the on two sides drowned the man  
 it is it again said pierre to himself and 
an involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the changed 
face in the sound of his voice in the stirring 
and noise of the he recognized that force which compelled 
people against their will to kill their fellow men force 
the effect of which he had during the executions to 
fear or to try to escape that force to entreaties 
or to those who served as its was pierre knew 
this now one had to wait and endure he did 
not again go to the man nor turn to look 
at him but stood frowning by the door of the 
 when that door was opened and the prisoners crowding 
against one another like a flock of into the pierre 
pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who 
as the had him was ready to do anything for 
him the captain was also in and on his cold 
face appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in 
the words and in the of the   on 
pass on the captain frowning sternly and looking at the 
prisoners who past him  pierre went up to him 
though he knew his would be vain   now 
the officer asked with a cold look as if not 
pierre  pierre told him about the man   
manage to walk devil take him said the captain  
on pass on he continued without looking at pierre  
 he is dying pierre again began   so 
good shouted the captain frowning angrily   rattled the 
and pierre understood that this force completely these men and 
that it was now to say any more  the 
officer prisoners were from the soldiers and told to march 
in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among 
them and about three hundred men  the officers who 
had come from the other were all to pierre and 
much better dressed than he they looked at him and 
at his shoes as at an not far from him 
walked a fat major with a sallow angry face who 
was wearing a gown tied round with a and who 
evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners he kept 
one hand in which he clasped his tobacco inside the 
bosom of his gown and held the of his pipe 
firmly with the other and the major and at everybody 
because he thought he was being pushed and that they 
were all hurrying when they had nowhere to to and 
were all surprised at something when there was nothing to 
be surprised at another a thin little officer was speaking 
to everyone where they were now being taken and how 
far they would get that day an official in felt 
and wearing a uniform ran round from side to side 
and gazed at the of moscow loudly his as to 
what had been down and what this or that part 
of the city was that they could see a third 
officer who by his accent was a pole with the 
officer arguing that he was mistaken in his of the 
different of moscow   are you about said the 
major angrily  does it matter whether it is st 
nicholas or st you see it down and there an 
end of it what are you pushing for isn the 
road wide enough said he turning to a man behind 
him who was not pushing him at all   
oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one 
side and another were heard saying as they gazed on 
the  the river and and in the just look 
there not half of it left yes i told you 
whole the river and so it is   you 
know it so what the use of talking said the 
major  as they passed near a in the  
of the few of moscow the whole of prisoners suddenly 
started to one side and of horror and were heard 
  the what yes dead dead so he is 
and with something  pierre too drew near the where 
the thing was that evoked these and made out something 
against the the from the words of his comrades who 
saw better than he did he found that this was 
the body of a man set upright against the with 
its face with   on what the devil go 
on thirty thousand the guards began and the french soldiers 
with fresh drove away with their the crowd of prisoners 
who were gazing at the dead man    
  chapter xiv   through the cross of 
the the prisoners followed only by their and the and 
belonging to that but when they reached the supply they 
came among a huge and train of mingled with private 
 at the bridge they all waiting for those in 
front to get across from the bridge they had a 
of lines of moving before and behind them to the 
right where the road near rows of and away into 
the distance these were of corps which had started before 
any of the others behind along the and across the 
stone bridge were and  in whose were the prisoners 
were crossing the bridge and some were already into the 
road but the out so that the last of train 
had not yet got out of moscow and reached the 
road when the of army was already from the great 
street  when they had the bridge the prisoners moved 
a few steps forward and again moved on and from 
all sides and men crowded closer and closer together they 
the few hundred that the bridge from the road taking 
more than an hour to do so and came out 
upon the square where the of the and the road 
and the prisoners close together had to stand for some 
hours at that from all sides like the of the 
sea were heard the of wheels the of feet and 
shouts of anger and pierre stood pressed against the wall 
of a house listening to that noise which mingled in 
his with the of the  to get a better 
several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the half 
house against which pierre was   just look at 
the they even on the look there those are they 
exclaimed  see what the have there see what that 
one has behind in the why those are taken from 
some by heaven oh the see how that fellow has 
himself up he can hardly walk good they even those 
see that fellow there sitting on the they   
right hit him on the his like this we get 
away before evening look look there why that must be 
napoleon own see what horses and the with a it 
like a house that fellow dropped his and doesn see 
it again a woman with a baby and not bad 
either yes i say that the way they let you 
pass just look there no end to it russian by 
heaven so they are in carriages how they settled themselves 
 again as at the in a of general curiosity 
bore all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre 
to his saw over the heads of the others what 
so their curiosity in three carriages among the together sat 
women with faces dressed in glaring colors who were shouting 
something in voices  from the moment pierre had recognized 
the appearance of the force nothing had seemed to him 
strange or dreadful neither the corpse with for fun nor 
these women hurrying away nor the of moscow all that 
he now scarcely made an on him if his soul 
making ready for a hard refused to receive that might 
it  the women drove by behind them came more 
soldiers soldiers carriages carriages soldiers more soldiers and now and 
then women  pierre did not see the people as 
but saw their movement  all these people and horses 
seemed driven forward by some invisible power during the hour 
pierre watched them they all came from the different with 
one and the same desire to get on quickly they 
all one another began to grow angry and to fight 
white teeth brows frowned ever the same words of from 
side to side and all the faces bore the same 
resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that 
morning on the face when the were  it was 
not till nearly evening that the officer the his men 
and with shouts and forced his way in among the 
and the prisoners in on all sides onto the road 
 they very quickly without resting and only when the 
sun began to set the drew up close together and 
the men began to prepare for their night rest they 
all appeared angry and dissatisfied for a long time angry 
shouts and could be heard from all sides a carriage 
that followed the ran into one of the and a 
hole in it with its pole several soldiers ran toward 
the from different sides some beat the carriage horses on 
their heads turning them aside others fought among themselves and 
pierre saw that one german was badly on the head 
by a sword  it seemed that all these men 
now that they had stopped amid in the of the 
evening experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant from 
the and eagerness to on that had seized them at 
the start once at a they all seemed to understand 
that they did not yet know where they were going 
and that much that was painful and difficult them on 
this  during this halt the treated the prisoners even 
worse than they had done at the start it was 
here that the prisoners for the first time received for 
their meat  from the officer down to the lowest 
they showed what seemed like spite against each of the 
prisoners in contrast to their former friendly relations  this 
spite still more when on calling over the of prisoners 
it was found that in the of leaving moscow one 
russian who had pretended to suffer from had pierre saw 
a frenchman beat a russian for too far from the 
road and heard his friend the captain and to court 
a officer on account of the escape of the russian 
to the officer excuse that the was ill and could 
not walk the officer replied that the order was to 
those who behind pierre felt that that force which had 
him during the executions but which he had not felt 
during his now again his it was terrible but he 
felt that in proportion to the of that force to 
crush him there grew and in his soul a power 
of life of it  he ate his supper of 
with and with his comrades  neither pierre nor any 
of the others spoke of what they had seen in 
moscow or of the of their by the french or 
of the order to them which had been announced to 
them as if in against the of their position they 
were all particularly animated and gay they spoke of of 
amusing scenes they had during the and all talk of 
their present situation  the sun had set long since 
bright stars shone out here and there in the sky 
a red glow as of a spread above the from 
the rising full moon and that red ball swayed in 
the gray it grew light the evening was ending but 
the night had not yet come pierre got up and 
left his new crossing between the to the other side 
of the road where he had been told the common 
prisoners were he wanted to talk to them on the 
road he was stopped by a french who ordered him 
back  pierre turned back not to his by the 
but to an where there was tucking his legs under 
him and dropping his head he sat down on the 
cold ground by the of the and remained a long 
while in thought suddenly he burst out into a fit 
of his broad good laughter so loud that men from 
sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and 
evidently laughter could mean   laughed pierre and he 
said aloud to himself  did not let me pass 
they took me and me up they hold me what 
me me my soul and he laughed till tears started 
to his eyes  a man got up and came 
to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at 
all by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther 
away from the man and looked around him  the 
huge that had with the of and the voices of 
many men had grown quiet the red were growing and 
dying down high up in the light sky the full 
moon and the unseen before were now visible in the 
distance and farther still those and the bright distance one 
to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the 
stars in its  all that is me all that 
is within me and it is all i thought pierre 
 they caught all that and put it into a 
up with he smiled and went and lay down to 
sleep beside his      chapter xv 
  in the early days of another came to 
kutuzov with a letter from napoleon peace and from moscow 
though napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the 
old road kutuzov replied to this letter as he had 
done to the one brought by saying that there could 
be no question of peace  soon after that a 
report was received from to the left of that of 
had been seen at and that being from the rest 
of the french army they might easily be destroyed the 
soldiers and officers again demanded on the staff by the 
memory of the easy at kutuzov to carry out kutuzov 
did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a 
which was a small was sent to to attack  
by a strange this task which turned out to be 
a most difficult and important one was to same modest 
little whom no one had described to us as drawing 
up of about in front of on and so on 
and who was thought to be and was spoken of 
as and whom we find wherever the position was most 
difficult all through the wars from to the year  
at he remained last at the the what was possible 
when all were flying and and not a single general 
was left in the ill with he went to with 
twenty thousand men to defend the town against napoleon whole 
army in at the he had hardly off in a 
of before he was by the of the town held 
out all day long at the battle of when was 
killed and nine of the men of our left had 
and the full force of the french fire was against 
it the man sent there was this same and to 
a mistake he had made by sending someone else there 
first and the quiet little and became the greatest glory 
of the russian army many have been described to us 
in and but of scarcely a word has been said 
 it was again whom they sent to and from 
there to the place where the last battle with the 
french was fought and where the obvious of the french 
army began and we are told of many and of 
that period of the but of nothing or very little 
is said and that and this silence about is the 
to his  it is natural for a man who 
does not understand the of a machine to imagine that 
a that has into it by and is with its 
and tossing about in it is its most important part 
the man who does not understand the of the machine 
cannot that the small which quietly is one of the 
most essential of the machine and not the which merely 
harms and the  on the tenth of when had 
gone halfway to and stopped at the village of preparing 
to the orders he had received the whole french army 
having in its movement reached position apparently in order to 
give battle without any reason turned off to the left 
onto the new road and began to enter where only 
had been till then at that time had under his 
command besides the two small of and  on the 
evening of  came to the with a french guardsman 
he had captured the said that the that had entered 
that day were the of the whole army that napoleon 
was there and the whole army had left moscow four 
days that same evening a house who had come from 
said he had seen an immense army entering the town 
some of having the french guards along the road to 
from all these reports it was evident that where they 
had expected to meet a single there was now the 
whole french army from moscow in an direction the road 
was to any as it was not clear to him 
now what he ought to do he had been ordered 
to attack but only had been there at that time 
and now the whole french army was there wished to 
act on his own but that he must have kutuzov 
so it was decided to send a dispatch to the 
staff  for this purpose a capable officer was who 
was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth 
besides a written report toward having received the dispatch and 
off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with 
spare horses      chapter xvi  
 it was a warm dark night it had been 
for four days having changed horses twice and twenty in 
an hour and a half over a road reached after 
one o at night at a on whose a general 
staff and down his he entered a dark passage  
 general on duty quick it very important said he 
to someone who had and was in the dark passage 
  has been very since the evening and this 
is the third night he has not said the in 
a whisper  should the captain first   this 
is very important from general said entering the open door 
which he had found by feeling in the dark  
the had gone in before him and began waking somebody 
  honor your honor a courier   what 
that from whom came a sleepy voice   and 
from napoleon is at said unable to see in the 
dark who was speaking but by the voice that it 
was not  the man who had and himself  
 don like waking him he said for something  
is very ill perhaps this is only a   
is the dispatch said  orders are to give it 
at once to the general on duty   a 
moment i light a you where do you always hide 
it said the voice of the man who was himself 
to the  was adjutant  found it i found 
it he added  the was striking a light and 
was for something on the   the said he 
with  by the light of the saw youthful face 
as he held the and the face of another man 
who was still this was  when the of the 
by the up first blue and then red lit the 
from the of which the that had been it were 
running away and looked at the was all over with 
and had his face by wiping it with his sleeve 
  gave the report inquired taking the   
news is said  and the all say the same 
thing   nothing to be done we have to 
him said rising and going up to the man in 
the who lay covered by a  said he  
did not stir  the general staff he said with 
a smile knowing that those words would be sure to 
him  and in fact the head in the was 
lifted at once on handsome resolute face with flushed by 
there still remained for an instant a expression from present 
affairs but then he suddenly started and his face assumed 
its habitual calm and firm appearance   what is 
it from whom he asked immediately but without at the 
light  while listening to the officer report broke the 
and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before 
he lowered his legs in their stockings to the floor 
and began putting on his then he took off his 
his hair over his and his cap   you 
get here quickly let us go to his  had 
understood at once that the news brought was of great 
importance and that no time must be lost he did 
not consider or ask himself whether the news was good 
or bad that did not interest him he regarded the 
whole business of the war not with his intelligence or 
his reason but by something else there was within him 
a deep conviction that all would be well but that 
one must not to this and still less speak about 
it but must only attend to one own work and 
he did his work giving his whole strength to the 
task  peter like seems to have been merely for 
sake in the list of the so of  and 
like he had the reputation of being a man of 
very capacity and information and like he never made of 
battle but was always found where the situation was most 
difficult since his appointment as general on duty he had 
always with his door open giving orders that every should 
be allowed to him up in battle he was always 
under fire so that kutuzov him for it and feared 
to send him to the front and like he was 
one of those that without clatter or noise the most 
essential part of the machine  coming out of the 
into the dark night frowned from an in his head 
and at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him of 
how all that of influential men on the staff would 
be up by this news especially who ever since had 
been at drawn with kutuzov and how they would make 
orders and them and this was disagreeable to him though 
he knew it could not be helped  and in 
fact to whom he went to the news immediately began 
to his to a general sharing his until who listened 
in weary silence reminded him that they must go to 
see his      chapter xvii  
 kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much 
at night he often fell unexpectedly in the but at 
night lying on his bed without he generally remained thinking 
 so he lay now on his bed his large 
heavy head on his plump hand with his one eye 
open and into the  since who with the emperor 
and had more influence than anyone else on the staff 
had to avoid him kutuzov was more at ease as 
to the of himself and his being to take part 
in movements the of the battle and of the day 
before it which kutuzov remembered with must he thought have 
some effect on others too   must understand that 
we can only lose by taking the offensive patience and 
time are my my thought kutuzov he knew that an 
should not be while it is green it will fall 
of itself when but if picked the is spoiled the 
tree is and your teeth are set on edge like 
an experienced he knew that the was and as only 
the whole strength of russia could have it but whether 
it was or not was still an question now by 
the fact of and having been sent and by the 
reports of the kutuzov was almost sure that the wound 
was but he further and it was necessary to wait 
  want to run to see how they have 
it wait and we shall see continual continual thought he 
 for only to distinguish themselves as if were fun 
they are like children from whom one can get any 
sensible account of what has happened because they all want 
to show how well they can fight but that not 
what is now   what they all to me 
it seems to them that when they have thought of 
two or three  remembered the general plan sent him 
from petersburg  have everything but the are  the 
question as to whether the wound at was or not 
had over kutuzov head for a whole month on the 
one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other 
kutuzov felt with all his being that the terrible blow 
into which he and all the russians had put their 
whole strength must have been but in any case were 
he had waited a whole month for them and grew 
more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed 
during those he did just what he those younger for 
doing he imagined all sorts of possible just like the 
younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands 
of instead of two or three and nothing on them 
the longer he thought the more themselves he imagined all 
sorts of movements of the army as a whole or 
in petersburg or against him or to him he thought 
too of the  he feared most of all that 
napoleon might fight him with his own and remain in 
moscow awaiting him kutuzov even imagined that napoleon army might 
turn back through and but the one thing he could 
not was what happened of napoleon army during its first 
days after leaving moscow a which made possible what kutuzov 
had not yet even dared to think of complete of 
the french report about the reports of distress in napoleon 
army of for leaving moscow all the that the french 
army was and preparing for flight but these were only 
which seemed important to the younger men but not to 
kutuzov with his years experience he knew what value to 
to knew how people who desire anything are to group 
all news so that it to what they desire and 
he knew how in such they all that makes for 
the contrary and the more he desired it the less 
he allowed himself to believe it this question all his 
mental all else was to him only life to such 
belonged his conversations with the staff the he wrote from 
to madame de the reading of the of his with 
petersburg and so on but the of the french which 
he alone foresaw was his heart one desire  on 
the night of the of he lay on his arm 
and thinking of that  there was a stir in 
the next room and he heard the steps of and 
  who there come in come in what news 
the field called out to them  while a footman 
was a the of the news   brought it 
asked kutuzov with a look which when the was lit 
struck by its cold severity   can be no 
doubt about it your   him in call him 
here  kutuzov sat up with one hanging down from 
the bed and his big resting against the other which 
was doubled under him he screwed up his seeing eye 
to the more carefully as if wishing to read in 
his face what his own mind   me tell 
me friend said he to in his low aged voice 
as he pulled together the shirt which open on his 
chest  nearer what news have you brought me eh 
that napoleon has left moscow are you sure eh  
gave a account from the beginning of all he had 
been told to report   don torture me kutuzov 
interrupted him  told him everything and was then silent 
awaiting was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked him 
he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered 
and wrinkled he waved his arm at and turned to 
the opposite side of the room to the corner by 
the that there   my has heard our said 
he in a voice with hands  is i thank 
thee o and he wept      
chapter xviii   from the time he received this 
news to the end of the all kutuzov was toward 
restraining his by by and by entreaty from or with 
the went to but kutuzov lingered with the main army 
and gave orders for the of which town seemed to 
him quite possible  everywhere kutuzov but the without waiting 
for his fled in the opposite direction  napoleon describe 
to us his at and and make as to what 
would have happened had napoleon been in time to into 
the rich  but not to speak of the fact 
that nothing prevented him from into those  the russian 
army did not his way the forget that nothing could 
have his army for then already it bore within itself 
the of how could that army had found in moscow 
and had them instead of keeping them and on at 
had instead of them could that army in which was 
by russians such as those who lived in moscow and 
where fire had the same property of what was set 
 that army could not anywhere since the battle of 
and the of moscow it had within itself as it 
were the elements of  the members of what had 
once been an army himself and all his soldiers fled 
knowing each concerned only to make his escape as quickly 
as possible from this position of the of which they 
were all more or less conscious  so it came 
about that at the at when the to together expressed 
opinions all were closed by the opinion uttered by the 
simple who speaking last said what they all felt that 
the one thing was to get away as quickly as 
possible and no one not even napoleon could say anything 
against that truth which they all recognized  but though 
they all realized that it was necessary to get away 
there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that 
they must an was to that shame and this came 
in time it was what the french called  de 
l  the day after the at napoleon out early 
in the morning amid the lines of his army with 
his of and an on the pretext of the army 
and the scene of the previous and of the battle 
some on the for fell in with the emperor and 
very nearly captured him if the did not napoleon then 
what him was the very thing that was the french 
army the on which the fell here as at they 
went after leaving the men napoleon they rushed after the 
and napoleon managed to escape  when don might so 
easily have taken the emperor himself in the midst of 
his army it was clear that there was nothing for 
it but to fly as fast as possible along the 
familiar road napoleon with his forty understood that not feeling 
his former and boldness and under the influence of the 
the had given him he at once agreed with and 
orders the tell us by the road  that napoleon 
agreed with and that the army does not prove that 
napoleon it to but that the forces which the whole 
army and it along the  is the road acted 
on him also      chapter xix 
  a man in motion always an aim for 
that motion to be able to go a thousand he 
must imagine that something good him at the end of 
those thousand one must have the prospect of a promised 
land to have the strength to move  the promised 
land for the french during their had been moscow during 
their it was their land but that land was too 
far off and for a man going a thousand it 
is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and 
to say to himself  i shall get to a 
place twenty off where i shall rest and spend the 
night and during the first day that resting place his 
goal and all his and desires and the felt by 
a single person are always in a crowd  for 
the french along the old road the final goal land 
too and their goal was toward which all their desires 
and in the them on it was not that they 
knew that much food and fresh them in nor that 
they were told so  the contrary their superior officers 
and napoleon himself knew that were there but because this 
alone could give them strength to move on and endure 
their present so both those who knew and those who 
did not know themselves and pushed on to as to 
a promised land  coming out onto the the french 
fled with surprising energy and toward the goal they had 
fixed on besides the common impulse which the whole crowd 
of french into one and them with a certain energy 
there was another cause them together great as with the 
law of gravity their enormous drew the human to itself 
in their of thousands they moved like a whole nation 
 each of them desired nothing more than to give 
himself up as a to escape from all this horror 
and but on the one hand the force of this 
common to their goal drew each of them in the 
same direction on the other hand an army corps could 
not to a company and though the french themselves of 
every opportunity to themselves and to on the slightest pretext 
such did not always occur their very and their crowded 
and movement them of that and it not only difficult 
but impossible for the russians to stop this movement to 
which the french were all their a certain no of 
the body could the process of  a of snow 
cannot be instantaneously there is a certain of time in 
less than which no amount of heat can the snow 
on the contrary the greater the heat the more the 
remaining snow  of the russian kutuzov alone understood this 
when the flight of the french army along the road 
became well what had on the night of the of 
began to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish 
themselves to cut off to seize to and to the 
french and all for  kutuzov alone used all his 
power  such power is very in the case of 
any commander in chief to prevent an attack  he 
could not tell them what we say now  fight 
why block the road losing our own men and unfortunate 
what is the use of that when a third of 
their army has away on the road from moscow to 
without any battle but drawing from his aged what they 
could understand he told them of the bridge and they 
laughed at and him themselves on and over the dying 
 and others in to the french near could not 
their desire to cut off and break up two french 
corps and by way of their intention to kutuzov they 
sent him a of paper in an  and try 
as kutuzov might to restrain the our men attacked trying 
to the road infantry we are told to the attack 
with music and with and killed and lost thousands of 
men  but they did not cut off or anybody 
and the french army up more firmly at the danger 
continued while steadily away to its path to   
   book fourteen      
 chapter i   the battle of with the 
occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of 
the french without further is one of the most in 
history  all agree that the of and nations in 
their with one another is expressed in wars and that 
as a direct result of greater or less success in 
war the political strength of and nations or  strange 
as may be the account of how some king or 
emperor having with another an army his army a by 
three five or ten thousand men and a and an 
nation of several millions all the of history  far 
as we know it the truth of the statement that 
the greater or success of one army against another is 
the cause or at least an essential indication of an 
increase or in the strength of the nation though it 
is unintelligible why the of an army part of a 
nation that whole nation to an army a and at 
once the rights of the nation have to the of 
the an army has and at once a people loses 
its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse 
and if its army a complete the nation is quite 
 so to history it has been found from the 
most times and so it is to our own day 
all napoleon wars serve to this rule in proportion to 
the of the army austria loses its rights and the 
rights and the strength of france increase the of the 
french at and the of prussia  but then in 
 the french gain a near moscow moscow is taken 
and after that with no further it is not russia 
that to exist but the french army of six hundred 
thousand and then france itself to strain the to fit 
the of history to say that the field of battle 
at remained in the hands of the russians or that 
after moscow there were other that destroyed napoleon army is 
impossible  after the french at there was no general 
nor any that were at all serious yet the french 
army ceased to exist what does this mean if it 
were an example taken from the history of china we 
might say that it was not an  is the 
usual when anything does not fit their if the matter 
concerned some in which only a small number of took 
part we might treat it as an exception but this 
occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was 
a question of the life or death of their and 
it happened in the greatest of all known wars  
the period of the of  from the battle of 
to the of the french that the winning of a 
battle does not produce a and is not even an 
indication of it that the force which the fate of 
lies not in the nor even in and but in 
something else  the french the condition of the french 
army before it left moscow that all was in order 
in the grand army except the cavalry the and the 
was no for the horses or the cattle that was 
a no one could for the of the their rather 
than let the french have it  the gained did 
not bring the usual because the and  after the 
french had moscow drove in their to the town and 
in general personally failed to any and the whole of 
such did not bring their to moscow for the high 
offered them but it instead  let us imagine two 
men who have come out to fight a with to 
all the of the art of the has gone on 
for some time suddenly one of the feeling himself and 
understanding that the matter is no joke but his life 
down his and the first that comes to hand to 
it then let us imagine that the who so employed 
the best and simplest means to his end was at 
the same time by of and to the of the 
case that he had gained his with the to all 
the of art one can imagine what and would result 
from such an account of the  the who demanded 
a to the of was the french army his who 
threw away the and up the was the russian people 
those who try to explain the matter to the of 
are the who have described the  after the burning 
of a war began which did not follow any previous 
of war the burning of and the after the blow 
at and the the burning of moscow the of the 
of and the war were all from the  napoleon 
felt this and from the time he took up the 
correct attitude in moscow and instead of his saw a 
raised above his head he did not to complain to 
kutuzov and to the emperor alexander that the war was 
being carried on contrary to all the if there were 
any for people in spite of the of the french 
as to the of the in spite of the fact 
that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather to 
fight with a and they wanted to a or to 
all the and to make an thrust and so on 
of the people war was lifted with all its menacing 
and strength and without anyone or and of anything else 
it rose and fell with stupid but and the french 
till the whole had perished  and it is well 
for a people who do not the french did in 
 to all the of art and presenting the of 
their gracefully and politely hand it to their but at 
the moment of without asking what others have adopted in 
simply and easily pick up the first that comes to 
hand and with it till the feeling of and in 
their soul to a feeling of and    
  chapter ii   one of the most 
obvious and advantageous from the so of war is the 
of groups against men pressed together in a such always 
in wars that take on a character in such actions 
instead of two each other the men attack singly run 
away when attacked by forces but again attack when opportunity 
this was done by the in by the mountain in 
the and by the russians in   people have 
called this kind of war  and that by so 
calling it they have explained its meaning but such a 
war does not fit in under any rule and is 
to a well rule of which is as that rule 
says that an should his forces in order to be 
than his at the moment of  war  as 
history shows that rule  this from the fact that 
military science the strength of an army to be with 
its military science says that the more the greater the 
strength         large 
are always victorious   for military science to say 
this is like in by reference to the only that 
are equal or to each other simply because the are 
equal or   of motion is the of and 
 in military affairs the strength of an army is 
the of its and some x  military science seeing 
in history of the fact that the size of any 
army does not with its strength and that small larger 
ones the of this and to it in a now 
in the equipment employed now and most usually in the 
of the but the of these to the does not 
which accord with the  yet it is only necessary 
to the  to the  of the of the 
directions in wartime by in order to find this  
that is the spirit of the army that is to 
say the greater or to fight and face danger felt 
by all the men an army quite of whether they 
are or are not under the command of a in 
two three with or with that thirty times a minute 
men who want to fight will always put themselves in 
the most advantageous for  the spirit of an army 
is the which by the gives the resulting force to 
and express the of this spirit of an army a 
problem for science  this problem is only if we 
to for the x itself the under which that force 
apparent as the commands of the general the equipment employed 
and so on these for the real of the and 
if we recognize this in its as being the greater 
or desire to fight and to face danger only then 
expressing known by and the of this can we hope 
to the  ten men or fifteen men or conquer 
is kill or take the others while themselves losing four 
so that on the one side four and on the 
other fifteen were lost the four were equal to the 
fifteen and therefore    x   this 
equation does not give us the value of the but 
gives us a between two and by bringing  of 
war into such a of could be obtained in which 
certain should exist and might be discovered  the rule 
that an army should act in when and in groups 
in the truth that the strength of an army depends 
on its spirit to lead men forward under fire more 
 only by movement in is than is to but 
this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of 
the army continually and is in particularly striking contrast to 
the when some strong rise or fall in the spirit 
of the as in all wars  the french in 
 to they should have into to defend themselves into 
a because the spirit of the army had so that 
only the held the army together the russians on the 
contrary ought to to have attacked in but in fact 
they up into small because their spirit had so that 
separate without orders at the french without any to them 
to themselves to and      chapter 
iii   the so war began with the of 
the french into  before had been recognized by the 
government thousands of and had been destroyed by the and 
the who killed them off as as dogs a mad 
dog to death with his russian was the first to 
recognize the value of this terrible which of the of 
military science destroyed the french and to him belongs the 
for taking the first step toward this method of  
on august  first was formed and then others were 
recognized the further the the more these became  the 
destroyed the great army they gathered the leaves that dropped 
of themselves from that tree french army sometimes shook that 
tree itself by when the french were toward there were 
of such of and there were some that adopted all 
the army and had infantry and the of life others 
solely of cossack cavalry there were also small groups of 
foot and horse and groups of and that remained a 
one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course 
of a month and there was the wife of a 
village elder who of the french  the up most 
in the latter days of its first period had passed 
when the themselves at their own boldness feared every minute 
to be and captured by the french and hid in 
the without hardly daring to and always expecting to be 
by the end of this kind of had taken definite 
shape it had become clear to all what could be 
against the french and what could not now only the 
of with and moving to at a distance from the 
french still regarded many things as impossible the small that 
had started their long before and had already observed the 
french considered things possible which the of the big did 
not to the and who in among the french now 
considered everything possible  on   was one of 
the was with his group at the height of the 
enthusiasm since early morning he and his party had been 
on the move all day long he had been watching 
from the forest that the a large french of cavalry 
and russian prisoners from the rest of the army which 
was learned from and prisoners moving under a strong to 
besides and dolokhov  also led a small party and 
moved in the of some large with also knew of 
this and as expressed it were their teeth for it 
two of the of large parties a pole and the 
other a german invitations to almost him to join up 
with their to attack the   i have myself 
said on reading these and he wrote to the german 
that despite his desire to serve under so and a 
general he had to that pleasure because he was already 
under the command of the general to the general he 
replied to the same effect him that he was already 
under the command of the german  having arranged matters 
thus and dolokhov intended without matters to the higher command 
to attack and seize that with their own small forces 
on  it was moving from the village of to 
that of to the left of the road between and 
there were large in some places up to the road 
itself though in others a mile or more back from 
it through these and his party all day sometimes keeping 
well back in them and sometimes coming to the very 
edge but never losing sight of the moving french that 
morning of party had seized and carried off into the 
forest two with cavalry which had stuck in the not 
far from where the forest ran close to the road 
since then and until evening the party had watched the 
movements of the french without it was necessary to let 
the french reach quietly without them and then after joining 
dolokhov who was to come that evening to a at 
a in the forest less than a mile from to 
surprise the french at dawn falling like an on their 
heads from two sides and and them all at one 
blow  in their more than a mile from where 
the forest came right up to the road six were 
to report if any fresh of french should show themselves 
 dolokhov was to observe the road in the same 
way to find out at what distance there were other 
french they that the had fifteen hundred men had two 
hundred and dolokhov might have as many more but the 
of did not all that he now wanted to know 
was what these were and to learn that he had 
to a  is a man from the that morning 
attack on the had been made so hastily that the 
with the had all been killed only a little boy 
had been taken and as he was a he could 
tell them nothing definite about the in that  considered 
it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of 
putting the whole on the so he sent a of 
his party to to try and seize at least one 
of the french who had been sent on in  
    chapter iv   it was 
a warm day the sky and the were both the 
color of water at times a sort of and then 
suddenly heavy rain came down  in a felt cloak 
and a cap from which the rain ran down was 
a thin horse with sides like his horse which turned 
its head and laid its ears back he from the 
rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with 
its short thick black looked angry  beside an  
fellow also in felt cloak and cap and a large 
don horse        a 
captain of   the third was a tall man 
as straight as an pale fair with light eyes and 
with calm self in his face and bearing though it 
was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the 
horse and lay yet at first glance at the and 
one saw that the latter was and uncomfortable and was 
a man on a horse while looking at the one 
saw that he was as comfortable and as much at 
ease as always and that he was not a man 
who had a horse but a man who was one 
with his horse a being possessed of strength  a 
little of them walked a to the skin and wearing 
a gray coat and a white cap  a little 
behind on a poor small with an enormous tail and 
and a mouth a young officer in a blue french 
 beside him an hussar with a boy in a 
tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the 
of his horse the boy held on to the hussar 
with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about 
him with surprise this was the french boy captured that 
morning  behind them along the forest road came hussars 
in and and then some in felt cloaks some in 
french and some with over their heads the horses being 
by the rain all looked black whether or their with 
their close looked thin rose from them clothes were all 
and like the ground and the leaves that the road 
the men sat up trying not to stir so as 
to warm the water that had to their and not 
admit the fresh cold water that was in under their 
seats their knees and at the back of their in 
the midst of the line of two drawn by french 
horses and by cossack horses that had been on in 
front over the tree and branches and through the water 
that lay in the  horse aside to avoid a 
in the and his knee against a tree   
the devil exclaimed angrily and showing his teeth he struck 
his horse three times with his himself and his comrades 
with  was out of sorts both because of the 
rain and also from  of them had anything since 
morning and yet more because he still had no news 
from dolokhov and the man sent to a  had 
not returned   hardly be another such to fall 
on a as today it too to attack them by 
and if we put it off till another day one 
of the big will the from under our thought continually 
forward to see a from dolokhov  on coming to 
a path in the forest along which he could see 
far to the right stopped   someone coming said 
he  the looked in the direction indicated   
are two an officer and a cossack but it is 
not that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the 
who was fond of using words the did not know 
 the approaching having a were no longer visible but 
they a few minutes later in front at a weary 
and using his an officer and whose had worked up 
to above his knees behind him standing in the a 
cossack the officer a very young lad with a broad 
rosy face and merry eyes up to and him a 
  the general said the officer  excuse its 
not being quite dry  frowning took the and opened 
it   they kept telling us  dangerous it 
dangerous said the officer addressing the while was reading the 
dispatch  and i pointed to the cossack prepared we 
have each of us two but what this he asked 
noticing the french boy  you already been in may 
i speak to him   petya exclaimed having run 
through the dispatch  didn you say who you were 
and turning with a smile he held out his hand 
to the lad  the officer was petya rostov  
all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave 
with as a grownup man and an officer at their 
previous acquaintance but as soon as smiled at him petya 
brightened up blushed with pleasure forgot the official manner he 
had been and began telling him how he had already 
been in a battle near and how a certain hussar 
had distinguished himself there   i am glad to 
see you interrupted him and his face again assumed its 
anxious expression   said he to the  is 
again that german you know he indicated petya serving under 
him  and told the that the dispatch just delivered 
was a of the german general demand that he should 
join forces with him for an attack on the  
 we don take it he it under our he 
added  while was talking to the petya by cold 
tone and that it was to the condition of his 
tried to pull them down under his so that no 
one should notice it while as an air as possible 
  there be any orders your honor he asked 
holding his hand at the and resuming the game of 
adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself  
shall i remain with your honor   repeated  
can you stay till   please may i stay 
with you cried petya   just what did the 
tell you to at once asked  petya blushed  
 gave me no i think i could he returned 
inquiringly   all said  and turning to his 
men he a party to go on to the place 
arranged near the in the forest and told the officer 
on the horse  performed the duties of an adjutant 
to go and find out where dolokhov was and whether 
he would come that evening himself intended going with the 
and petya to the edge of the forest where it 
reached out to to have a look at the part 
of the french they were to attack next day  
 old fellow said he to the  us to 
 petya and the accompanied by some and the hussar 
who had the to the left across a to the 
edge of the forest      chapter 
v   the rain had stopped and only the 
was falling and from the the and petya silently following 
the in the cap who lightly with and moving in 
his shoes over the and leaves silently led them to 
the edge of the forest  he ascended an stopped 
looked about him and to where the of was less 
on reaching a large oak tree that had not yet 
its leaves he stopped and mysteriously to them with his 
hand  and petya up to him from the spot 
where the was standing they could see the french immediately 
the forest on a downward lay a field of spring 
to the right a was a small village and a 
house with a broken in the village in the house 
in the garden by the well by the over all 
the rising ground and all along the road from the 
bridge leading to the village not more than five hundred 
away of men could be seen through the their un 
shouting at their horses which were with the and their 
calls to one another could be clearly heard   
the here said in a low voice not taking his 
eyes off the french  a cossack lifted the boy 
down and took him to pointing to the french asked 
him what these and those of them were the boy 
his cold hands into his and lifting his eyebrows looked 
at in but in spite of an evident desire to 
say all he knew gave confused merely to everything asked 
him turned away from him frowning and addressed the his 
own to him  petya rapidly turning his head looked 
now at the boy now at now at the and 
now at the french in the village and along the 
road trying not to miss anything of importance   
dolokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said 
with a merry in his eyes   is a 
very spot said the   send the down by 
the continued  up to the garden you wide up 
there with the pointed to a spot in the forest 
the village i with my hussars here and at the 
signal   hollow is a there said the  
horses would we must ride round more to the left 
 while they were talking in the of a sounded 
from the low ground by the a of white smoke 
appeared then another and the sound of of merry french 
voices shouting together came up from the for a moment 
and the drew back they were so near that they 
thought they were the cause of the and shouting but 
the and shouting did not to them down below a 
man wearing something red was running through the the french 
were evidently and shouting at him   that our 
said the   it is it is   
said   get away said the screwing up his 
eyes  the man whom they called having run to 
the stream in so that the water in the air 
and having for an instant out on all all black 
with the and ran on the french who had been 
him stopped   that said the   a 
said with his former look of vexation  has he 
been doing all this time   is he asked 
petya   our i sent him to a  
  yes said petya nodding at the first words 
uttered as if he understood it all though he really 
did not understand anything of it  was one of 
the most men in their band he was a from 
near the river when had come to at the beginning 
of his and had as usual the village elder and 
asked him what he knew about the french the elder 
as though himself had replied as all village elders did 
that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them 
but when explained that his purpose was to kill the 
french and asked if no french had strayed that way 
the elder replied that some  had really been at 
their village but that was the only man who with 
such matters had called and having him for his said 
a few words in the elder presence about to the 
and the country and the hatred of the french that 
all sons of the should   don do the 
french any said evidently frightened by words  only about 
with the for fun you know we killed a score 
or so of  but we did no else  
next day when had left having quite forgotten about this 
it was to him that had attached himself to their 
party and asked to be allowed to remain with it 
gave orders to let him do so  who at 
first did rough work laying water dead horses and so 
on soon showed a great and for at night he 
would go out for and always brought back french and 
and when told to would bring in french also then 
relieved him from and began taking him with him when 
he went out on and had him among the  
did not like and always went on foot never behind 
the cavalry he was with a  he carried rather 
as a joke a and an which latter he used 
as a its teeth with equal ease picking out of 
its or thick bones with equal would with at arm 
length or holding the head of the would cut thin 
little or in party he held a peculiar and exceptional 
position when anything particularly difficult or had to be done 
a out of the with one shoulders pull a horse 
out of a by its tail skin it in among 
the french or walk more than thirty in a day 
pointed at   won hurt that devil as strong 
as a horse they said of him  once a 
frenchman was trying to a at him and him in 
the part of the back that wound  treated only 
with and of was the subject of the by the 
whole in which joined   never again gave you 
a the would him and and making faces pretended to 
be angry and at the french with the the only 
effect of this on was that after being he brought 
in prisoners  he was the and most man in 
the party no one found more for no one captured 
or killed more and he was made the of all 
the and hussars and willingly that role now he had 
been sent by to to a  but whether because 
he had not been to take only one frenchman or 
because he had through the night he had by day 
into some right among the french and as had from 
above had been by them      
chapter vi   after talking for some time with 
the about next day attack which now seeing how near 
they were to the french he seemed to have decided 
on turned his horse and back   my lad 
we go and get he said to petya  as 
they approached the stopped into the forest among the a 
man with long legs and long arms wearing a short 
jacket shoes and a hat was approaching with long light 
steps he had a over his shoulder and an stuck 
in his when he he hastily threw something into the 
removed his hat by its and approached his commander it 
was his wrinkled and face and little eyes beamed with 
self he lifted his head high and gazed at as 
if a laugh   where did you to inquired

boldly and hurriedly in a but bass voice   
did you yourself in there by you well why haven

 i like this through the wood and lay down 
 suddenly lay down on his with a movement to 
show how he had done it  turned up and

 along to the colonel i said he and suddenly 
there were four of them they rushed at me with 
their little so i went for them with my this 
way  are you up to says i  be 
with you shouted his arms with an angry and out 
his chest   we saw from the hill how 
you took to your heels through the said the screwing 
up his eyes  petya badly wanted to laugh but 
noticed that they all refrained from laughing he turned his 
eyes rapidly from face to the and unable to make 
out what it all meant   play the fool 
said angrily  didn you the first one  his 
back with one hand and his head with the other 
then suddenly his whole face into a beaming foolish a 
where he had lost a  was why he was 
called smiled and petya burst into a of merry laughter 
in which himself joined   but he was a 
regular good said  clothes on him how could i 
bring him and so your honor why he says  
a general son myself i won go he says

angry  as if i never seen your only wait 
till it gets dark and i you any of them 
you want if you like   let go said 
and all the way to the in silence and frowning 
angrily  followed behind and petya heard the laughing with 
him and at him about some pair of he had 
thrown into the  when the fit of laughter that 
had seized him at words and smile had passed and 
petya realized for a moment that this had killed a 
man he felt uneasy he looked round at the boy 
and felt a in his heart but this only a 
moment he felt it necessary to hold his head higher 
to himself and to question the with an air of 
importance about tomorrow that he might not be of the 
company in which he found himself  the officer who 
had been sent to met on the way with the 
news that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was 
well with him  at once up and calling petya 
to him said  tell me about yourself   
   chapter vii   petya having left 
his people after their from moscow joined his regiment and 
was soon taken as by a general a large from 
the time he received his and especially since he had 
joined the active army and taken part in the battle 
of petya had been in a constant state of excitement 
at being grown and in a perpetual ecstatic not to 
miss any to do something really he was highly delighted 
with what he saw and experienced in the army but 
at the same time it always seemed to him that 
the really were being performed just where he did not 
happen to be and he was always in a to 
get where he was not  when on the twenty 
of his general expressed a wish to send somebody to 
petya begged so to be sent that the general could 
not refuse but when him he recalled petya mad at 
the battle of where instead of by the road to 
the place to which he had been sent he had 
to the line under the fire of the french and 
had there twice his so now the general his taking 
part in any of that was why petya had blushed 
and grown confused when asked him whether he could stay 
before they had to the of the forest petya had 
considered he must carry out his and return at once 
but when he saw the french and saw and learned 
that there would certainly be an attack that night he 
decided with the with which young people change their views 
that the general whom he had greatly respected till then 
was a german that was a hero the a hero 
and a hero too and that it would be shameful 
for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty 
 it was already growing when petya and the up 
to the in the horses could be seen and and 
hussars who had up rough in the and were in 
a hollow of the forest where the french could not 
see the smoke in the passage of the small a 
cossack with sleeves rolled up was some in the room 
three officers of band were a door into a petya 
took off his clothes gave them to be and at 
once began helping the officers to up the dinner table 
 in ten minutes the table was ready and a 
napkin spread on it on the table were a of 
rum white roast and  sitting at table with the 
officers and the fat savory with his hands down which 
the grease petya was in an ecstatic childish state of 
love for all men and of confidence that others loved 
him in the same way   then what do 
you think vasili said he to  all right my 
staying a day with you and not waiting for a 
reply he answered his own question  see i was 
told to find out i am finding out only do 
let me into the very into the chief i don 
want a reward but i want  petya his teeth 
and looked around back his head and his arms  
 the chief repeated with a smile   please 
let me command something so that i may really command 
petya went on  would it be to you oh 
you want a he said turning to an officer who 
wished to cut himself a piece of  and he 
him his the officer it   keep it i 
have several like it said petya blushing  i was 
quite forgetting he suddenly cried  have some fine ones 
you know ones we have a new and he has 
such capital things i ten pounds i am used to 
something sweet would you like some and petya ran out 
into the passage to his cossack and brought back some 
which about five pounds of  some gentlemen have some 
  want a don you he asked the  
a capital one from our he has splendid things and 
he very that the chief thing i be sure to 
send it to you or perhaps your are giving out 
or are worn out happens sometimes you know i have 
brought some with me here they are he showed a 
bag hundred i them very please take as many as 
you want or all if you like  then suddenly 
he had said too much petya stopped and blushed  
he tried to remember whether he had not done anything 
else that was foolish and running over the of the 
day he remembered the french boy  capital for us 
here but what of him where have they put him 
have they him haven they hurt his he thought but 
having caught himself saying too much about the he was 
now afraid to speak out   might ask he 
thought  they say  a boy himself and so 
he the boy i show them tomorrow whether i a 
boy will it seem if i ask petya thought  
never mind and immediately blushing and looking anxiously at the 
officers to see if they appeared ironical he said  
 i call in that boy who was taken and 
give him something to eat perhaps   he a 
poor little fellow said who evidently saw nothing shameful in 
this  him in his name is have him  
 call him said petya   yes call him 
a poor little fellow repeated  petya was standing at 
the door when said this he slipped in between the 
officers came close to and said   me kiss 
you dear old fellow oh how fine how splendid  
and having kissed he ran out of the   
petya cried stopping outside the door   do you 
want sir asked a voice in the  petya replied 
that he wanted the french lad who had been captured 
that day   said a cossack  the boy 
name had already been changed by the into  and 
into by the and soldiers in both these the reference 
to spring  the made by the young lad  
 is himself there by the laughing voices were heard 
calling to one another in the   a lad 
said an hussar standing near petya  gave him something 
to eat a while ago he was  the sound 
of bare feet through the was heard in the and 
the boy came to the door   vous said 
petya  on vous de  he added and affectionately 
touching the boy hand       
     it you do you want 
something to eat don be      
afraid they won hurt you      
    in come in    
monsieur  said the boy in a almost childish voice 
and he began scraping his dirty feet on the  
       you sir  
 there were many things petya wanted to say to 
the boy but did not to he stood beside him 
in the passage then in the he took the boy 
hand and pressed it   in come in he 
repeated in a gentle whisper  what can i do 
for him he thought and opening the door he let 
the boy pass in first  when the boy had 
entered the petya sat down at a distance from him 
considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him 
but he the money in his and wondered whether it 
would seem to give some to the boy   
   chapter viii   the arrival of 
dolokhov petya attention from the boy to whom had had 
some and given and whom he had had dressed in 
a russian coat so that he might be kept with 
their band and not sent away with the other prisoners 
petya had heard in the army many stories of dolokhov 
extraordinary and of his to the french so from the 
moment he entered the petya did not take his eyes 
from him but himself up more and more and held 
his head high that he might not be even of 
such company  dolokhov appearance petya by its  wore 
a cossack coat had a had an of nicholas the 
wonder on his breast and his way of speaking and 
everything he did indicated his position but dolokhov who in 
moscow had worn a had now the appearance of a 
most correct officer of the guards he was clean and 
wore a guardsman coat with an order of st george 
at his and a plain cap set straight on his 
head he took off his felt cloak in a corner 
of the room and without greeting anyone went up to 
and began him about the matter in hand told him 
of the the large had on the of the petya 
had brought and his own to both then he told 
him all he knew of the french   so 
but we must know what they are and their said 
dolokhov  will be necessary to go there we can 
start the affair without knowing for certain how many there 
are i like to work here now one of these 
gentlemen like to ride over to the french with me 
i have brought a spare uniform   i i 
go with you cried petya   no need for 
you to go at all said addressing dolokhov  as 
for him i won let him go on any account 
  like that exclaimed petya  i go  
 it   you must excuse me because because 
i shall go and that all you take me won 
you he said turning to dolokhov   not dolokhov 
answered scrutinizing the face of the french boy  you 
had that with you long he asked   was 
taken today but he knows nothing i keeping him with 
me   and where do you put the others 
inquired dolokhov   i send them away and take 
a for them shouted suddenly flushing  i say boldly 
that i have not a single man life on my 
conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty 
or men to town under instead of speak the honor 
of a   kind of amiable talk would be 
from this young count of sixteen said dolokhov with cold 
irony  it time for you to drop it  
 i not said anything i only say that i 
certainly go with you said petya   for you 
and me old fellow it time to drop these continued 
dolokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of 
this subject which  why have you kept this lad 
he went on swaying his head  you are sorry 
for him don we know those  of yours you 
send a hundred men away and thirty get there the 
rest either or get killed so isn it all the 
same not to send them  the screwing up his 
light eyes nodded approvingly   not the point i 
not going to discuss the matter i do not wish 
to take it on my conscience you say they die 
all only not by my  dolokhov began laughing  
 has told them not to me these twenty times 
over but if they did catch me they string me 
up to an tree and with all your just the 
same he paused  we must get to work tell 
the cossack to my i have two french in it 
well are you coming with me he asked petya  
 yes yes certainly cried petya blushing almost to tears 
and glancing at  while dolokhov had been with what 
should be done with prisoners petya had once more felt 
awkward and but again he had no time to fully 
what they were talking about  grown distinguished men think 
so it must be necessary and right thought he  
above all must not to imagine that i obey him 
and that he can order me about i will certainly 
go to the french with dolokhov if he can so 
can i  and to all petya replied that he 
too was accustomed to do everything and not just and 
that he never considered danger   you admit that 
if we don know for sure how many of them 
there are of lives may on it while there are 
only two of us besides i want to go very 
much and certainly will go so don me said he 
 will only make things worse     
 chapter ix   having put on french and 
petya and dolokhov to the from which had the french 
and from the forest in pitch they into the hollow 
on reaching the bottom dolokhov told the him to him 
there and on at a quick along the road to 
the bridge petya his heart in his mouth with excitement 
by his side   we caught i won be 
taken i have a whispered he   talk russian 
said dolokhov in a hurried whisper and at that very 
moment they heard through the the challenge   and 
the of a        
 goes there   the blood rushed to petya 
face and he his     replied dolokhov 
neither nor his horse       
  of the  regiment   the black 
figure of a stood on the bridge   d 
          
 dolokhov in his horse and at a walk  
 le colonel est  he asked    
     me is colonel here  
  d repeated the the way and not  
 un le d cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and 
straight at the  vous demande le colonel est  
         an 
officer is making his round don ask    
  him for the i am asking you if 
the colonel is      here  
 and without waiting for an answer from the who 
had stepped aside dolokhov up the at a walk  
noticing the black of a man crossing the road dolokhov 
stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were 
the man a with a over his shoulder stopped came 
close up to dolokhov horse touched it with his hand 
and explained simply and in a friendly way that the 
commander and the officers were higher up the hill to 
the right in the courtyard of the farm as he 
called the house  having up the road on both 
sides of which french talk could be heard around the 
dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the house having in 
he and approached a big around which sat several men 
talking something was in a small at the edge of 
the fire and a in a cap and blue lit 
up by the fire was beside it stirring its with 
a   he a hard to said one of 
the officers who was sitting in the at the other 
side of the fire   make them get a 
move on those fellows said another laughing  both fell 
silent out through the at the sound of dolokhov and 
petya steps as they to the fire leading their horses 
   said dolokhov loudly and clearly   
      day gentlemen   
there was a stir among the officers in the the 
fire and one tall long officer round the fire came 
up to dolokhov   that you he asked  
the devil but noticing his mistake he broke off short 
and with a frown greeted dolokhov as a stranger asking 
what he could do for him  dolokhov said that 
he and his companion were trying to their regiment and 
addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything 
of the  regiment none of them knew anything and 
petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him 
and dolokhov with and for some all were silent  
 you were counting on the evening you have come 
too late said a voice from behind the fire with 
a laugh  dolokhov replied that they were not and 
must on farther that night  he the horses over 
to the who was stirring the and down on his 
heels by the fire beside the officer with the long 
neck that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov 
and again asked to what regiment he belonged dolokhov as 
if he had not heard the question did not reply 
but a short french pipe which he took from his 
began asking the officer in how far the road before 
them was safe from   brigands are everywhere replied 
an officer from behind the fire  dolokhov remarked that 
the were a danger only to such as his companion 
and himself  probably they would not to attack large 
he added inquiringly no one replied   now he 
come away petya thought every moment as he stood by 
the listening to the talk  but dolokhov the conversation 
which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to 
how many men there were in the how many and 
how many prisoners asking about the russian prisoners with that 
dolokhov said   horrid business these about with one 
it would be better to such and burst into loud 
laughter so strange that petya thought the french would immediately 
their and took a step back from the  no 
one replied a word to dolokhov laughter and a french 
officer whom they could not see  lay wrapped in 
a rose and whispered something to a companion dolokhov got 
up and called to the who was holding their horses 
  they bring our horses or not thought petya 
drawing nearer to dolokhov  the horses were brought  
 evening gentlemen said dolokhov  petya wished to say 
 night but could not utter a word the officers 
were together dolokhov was a long time his horse which 
would not stand still then he out of the yard 
at a petya beside him to look round to see 
whether or not the french were running after them but 
not daring to  coming out onto the road dolokhov 
did not ride back across the open country but through 
the village at one spot he stopped and listened  
you hear he asked petya recognized the sound of russian 
voices and saw the dark of russian prisoners round their 
when they had to the bridge petya and dolokhov past 
the who without saying a word up and down it 
then they into the hollow where the them   
now good tell  the first at said dolokhov and 
was about to ride away but petya seized hold of 
him   he cried  are such a hero 
oh how fine how splendid how i love you  
 right all right said dolokhov but petya did not 
let go of him and dolokhov saw through the that 
petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him 
dolokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse and vanished into 
the      chapter x   
having returned to the petya found in the passage he 
was awaiting petya return in a state of agitation anxiety 
and self for having let him go   god 
he exclaimed  thank god he repeated listening to petya 
rapturous account  devil take you i haven because of 
you well thank god now lie down we can still 
get a nap before morning   no said petya 
 don want to sleep yet besides i know myself 
if i fall it finished and then i am used 
to not before a battle  he sat in the 
joyfully the of his expedition and to himself what would 
happen next day  then noticing that was he rose 
and went out of doors  it was still quite 
dark outside the rain was over but were still falling 
from the near the the black of the and of 
horses together could be seen behind the the dark of 
the two with their horses beside them were and in 
the hollow the dying red not all the and hussars 
were here and there amid the sounds of falling and 
the of the horses near by could be heard low 
voices which seemed to be  petya came out peered 
into the and went up to the someone was under 
them and around them stood horses their in the dark 
petya recognized his own horse which he called  though 
it was of and went up to it   
we do some service tomorrow said he its and kissing 
it   you sir said a cossack who was 
sitting under a   ah that your name do 
you know i have only just come back we been 
into the french  and petya gave the cossack a 
account not only of his ride but also of his 
object and why he considered it better to his life 
than to act    you should get some 
sleep now said the cossack   i am used 
to this said petya  say the in your worn 
out i brought some with me don you want any 
you can have some  the cossack bent forward from 
under the to get a closer look at petya  
 i am accustomed to doing everything said petya  
fellows do things just without and then they sorry for 
it afterwards i don like that   so said 
the cossack   yes another thing please my dear 
fellow will you my saber for me it got  
feared to tell a lie and the saber never had 
been  you do it   course i can 
 got up in his and soon petya heard the 
sound of on he climbed onto the and sat on 
its edge the cossack was the saber under the  
 say are the asked petya   are and 
some us   and that boy   oh 
he thrown himself down there in the passage fast after 
his he was that glad  after that petya remained 
silent for a long time listening to the sounds he 
heard footsteps in the and a black figure appeared  
 are you asked a man coming up to the 
  this saber   right said the man 
whom petya took to be an hussar  the cup 
left here   by the  the hussar took 
the cup   must be soon said he and 
went away  petya ought to have known that he 
was in a forest with band less than a mile 
from the road sitting on a captured from the french 
beside which horses were that under it was sitting a 
saber for him that the big dark to the right 
was the and the red below to the left was 
the dying of a that the man who had come 
for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink 
but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of 
all this he was in a where nothing the big 
dark might really be the or it might be a 
leading to the very of the earth perhaps the red 
spot was a fire or it might be the eye 
of an enormous perhaps he was really sitting on a 
but it might very well be that he was not 
sitting on a but on a high from which if 
he fell he would have to fall for a whole 
day or a whole month or go on falling and 
never reach the bottom perhaps it was just the cossack 
who was sitting under the but it might be the 
most wonderful most splendid man in the world whom no 
one knew of it might really have been that the 
hussar came for water and went back into the hollow 
but perhaps he had simply vanished and into  nothing 
petya could have seen now would have surprised him he 
was in a where everything was possible  he looked 
up at the sky and the sky was a like 
the earth it was and over the of the were 
swiftly sailing as if the stars sometimes it looked as 
if the were passing and a clear black sky appeared 
sometimes it seemed as if the black were sometimes the 
sky seemed to be rising high high and then it 
seemed to so low that one could touch it with 
one hand  petya eyes began to close and he 
swayed a little  the were quiet talking was heard 
the horses and one another someone   the saber 
against the and suddenly petya heard an playing some sweetly 
solemn petya was as musical as natasha and more so 
than nicholas but had never learned music or thought about 
it and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his 
mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive the music 
became more and more audible the melody grew and passed 
from one instrument to another and what was played was 
a petya had not the least of what a is 
each instrument a and now a but better and than 
or its own part and before it had finished the 
melody with another instrument that began almost the same air 
and then with a third and a fourth and they 
all into one and again became separate and again now 
into solemn music now into something brilliant and   
that was in a petya said to himself as he 
forward  in my ears but perhaps it music of 
my own well go on my music now  he 
closed his eyes and from all sides as if from 
a distance sounds grew into and again all mingled into 
the same sweet and solemn  this is delightful as 
much as i like and as i like said petya 
to himself he tried to conduct that enormous   
softly softly die away and the sounds him  more 
joyful still more and more joyful and from an rose 
sounds  voices join in ordered petya and at first 
from he heard men voices and then women the voices 
grew in strength and petya listened to their beauty in 
and joy  with a solemn march there mingled a 
song the from the and the of the saber  
and again the horses one another and not disturbing the 
but joining in it  petya did not know how 
long this he enjoyed himself all the time wondered at 
his enjoyment and that there was no one to it 
he was by kindly voice   ready your honor 
you can a frenchman in half with it  petya 
up   getting light it really getting light he 
exclaimed  the horses that had been invisible could now 
be seen to their very and a light showed itself 
through the bare branches petya shook himself jumped up took 
a from his and gave it to then he the 
saber it and it the were their horses and their 
  here the commander said  came out of 
the and having called petya gave orders to get ready 
     chapter xi   the 
men rapidly picked out their horses in the their and 
formed stood by the giving final orders the infantry of 
the passed along the road and quickly amid the in 
the of early dawn of feet through the the gave 
some orders to his men petya held his horse by 
the awaiting the order to his face having been in 
cold water was all and his eyes were particularly brilliant 
cold ran down his spine and his whole body  
 is asked  the horses  the horses were 
brought was angry with the cossack because the were too 
him and petya put his foot in the his horse 
by habit made as if to his but petya quickly 
into the of his own weight and turning to look 
at the hussars starting in the behind him up to 
  me with some please for god sake said 
he  seemed to have forgotten petya very he turned 
to glance at him   ask one thing of 
you he said sternly  obey me and not yourself 
forward anywhere  he did not say another word to 
petya but in silence all the way when they had 
come to the edge of the forest it was growing 
light over the field talked in with the and the 
past petya and when they had all by touched his 
horse and down the hill slipping onto their and the 
horses with their into the petya beside the of his 
body constantly it was getting and but the still hid 
having reached the valley looked back and nodded to a 
cossack beside him   signal said he  the 
cossack raised his arm and a rang out in an 
instant the of horses forward was heard shouts came from 
sides and then more  at the first sound of 
and shouting petya his horse and his forward not heeding 
who shouted at him it seemed to petya that at 
the moment the was it suddenly became as bright as 
he to the bridge were along the road in front 
of him on the bridge he with a cossack who 
had behind but he on in front of him soldiers 
probably were running from right to left across the road 
one of them fell in the under his horse feet 
 were crowding about a busy with something from the 
midst of that crowd terrible petya up and the first 
thing he saw was the pale face and of a 
frenchman the handle of a that had been at him 
  ours shouted petya and giving to his horse 
he forward along the village street  he could hear 
of him hussars and russian prisoners who had come running 
from both sides of the road were shouting something loudly 
and a frenchman in a blue and with a frowning 
red face had been himself against the hussars when petya 
up the frenchman had already  late again flashed through 
petya mind and he on to the place from which 
the could be heard the came from the yard of 
the house he had the night before with dolokhov the 
french were making a stand there behind a in a 
garden with and were at the who crowded at the 
through the smoke as he approached the petya saw dolokhov 
whose face was of a pale tint shouting to his 
men  round wait for the infantry he exclaimed as 
petya up to him   shouted petya and without 
a moment to the place came the sounds of and 
where the smoke was  a was heard and some 
past while others against something the and dolokhov after petya 
into the of the courtyard in the smoke some of 
the french threw down their arms and ran out of 
the to meet the while others ran down the hill 
toward the petya was along the courtyard but instead of 
holding the he waved both his arms about rapidly and 
slipping farther and farther to one side in his his 
horse having up to a that was in the morning 
light stopped suddenly and petya fell heavily on to the 
ground the saw that his arms and legs rapidly though 
his head was quite a had his skull  after 
speaking to the senior french officer who came out of 
the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword 
and announced that they dolokhov and went up to petya 
who lay with arms   for he said with 
a frown and went to the to meet who was 
toward him   cried from a distance the lifeless 
attitude familiar to him which petya body was lying  
 for repeated dolokhov as if the of these words 
him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners 
who were by who had hurried up  won take 
them he called out to  did not reply he 
up to petya and with hands turned toward himself the 
face which had already gone white   am used 
to something sweet fine ones take them all he recalled 
petya words and the looked round in surprise at the 
sound like the of a dog with which turned away 
walked to the and seized hold of it  among 
the russian prisoners by and dolokhov was pierre bezukhov  
    chapter xii   during the 
whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had 
been by the french the party of prisoners among whom 
was pierre on the twenty of that party was no 
longer with the same and with which it had left 
moscow half the with that had the first with them 
had been captured by the other half had gone on 
not one of those who had in front of the 
prisoners was left they had all the the prisoners had 
seen in front of them during the first days was 
now replaced by enormous train by behind the prisoners came 
a cavalry train  from the french army which had 
till then moved in three went on as a single 
group the of that pierre had noticed at their first 
place after leaving moscow had now reached the  the 
road along which they moved was on both sides by 
dead horses men who had behind from continually changed about 
now joining the moving now again behind it  several 
times during the march had been given and the soldiers 
of the had raised their and run one another but 
had afterwards and each other for their  these three 
groups together cavalry the of prisoners and train a separate 
and whole though each of the groups was rapidly away 
 of the train which had of a hundred and 
twenty not more than now remained the rest had been 
captured or left behind some of also had been captured 
or three had been and by from corps from the 
talk of the pierre learned that a larger had been 
to that train than to the prisoners and that one 
of their comrades a german had been by the own 
order because a silver belonging to the had been found 
in his  the group of prisoners had away most 
of all of the three hundred and thirty men who 
had set out from moscow than a hundred now remained 
the prisoners were more to the than even the cavalry 
or they understood that the and might be of some 
use but that cold and soldiers should have to stand 
and cold and russians who and behind on the road 
 which case the order was to them was not 
merely but and the as if afraid in the condition 
they themselves were in of giving way to the pity 
they felt for the prisoners and so their own still 
worse treated them with particular and severity  at while 
the soldiers of the after the prisoners in a had 
gone off to their own several of the prisoners under 
the wall and ran away but were by the french 
and  the adopted when they started that the officer 
prisoners should be kept separate from the rest had long 
since been all who could walk went together and after 
the third pierre had rejoined and the gray dog that 
had for its  on the third day after leaving 
moscow again fell ill with the he had from in 
the hospital in moscow and as he grew gradually pierre 
kept away from him pierre did not know why but 
since had to grow it had cost him an effort 
to go near him when he did so and heard 
the subdued with which generally lay down at the places 
and when he the from him which was now than 
before pierre moved farther away and did not think about 
him  while in the pierre had learned not with 
his but with his whole being by life itself that 
man is for happiness that happiness is within him in 
the satisfaction of simple human and that all not from 
but from and now during these last three of the 
march he had learned still another new truth nothing in 
this world is terrible he had learned that as there 
is no condition in which man can be happy and 
entirely free so there is no condition in which he 
need be unhappy and lack freedom he learned that suffering 
and freedom have their and that those are very near 
together that the person in a bed of roses with 
one as as he now on the bare earth with 
one side growing while the other was and that when 
he had put on dancing shoes he had just as 
he did now when he walked with bare feet that 
were covered with having long since to he discovered that 
when he had married his wife his own free will 
as it had seemed to him had been no more 
free than now when they him up at night in 
a of all that he himself subsequently his sufferings but 
which at the time he scarcely felt the was the 
state of his bare and feet  was and the 
of the they used instead of was even pleasant there 
was no great cold it was always warm in the 
and at night there were the the that him his 
body the one thing that was at first hard to 
bear was his feet  after the second day march 
pierre having examined his feet by the thought it would 
be impossible to walk on them but when everybody got 
up he went along and when he had up walked 
without feeling the though at night his feet were more 
terrible to look at than before however he did not 
look at them now but thought of other things  
only now did pierre the full strength of life in 
man and the power he has of his attention from 
one thing to another which is like the safety of 
a that to blow off when the pressure a certain 
 he did not see and did not hear how 
they the prisoners who behind though more than a hundred 
perished in that way he did not think of who 
grew every day and evidently would soon have to that 
fate still less did pierre think about himself the his 
position became and the more terrible the future the more 
of that position in which he found himself were the 
joyful and comforting thoughts and that came to him  
    chapter xiii   at on 
the twenty of pierre was going along the road looking 
at his feet and at the of the way occasionally 
he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then 
again at his feet the former and the latter were 
alike familiar and his own the blue dog ran merrily 
along the side of the road sometimes in of its 
and self lifting one and along on three and then 
again going on all four and rushing to at the 
that sat on the the dog was and than it 
had been in moscow all around lay the of different 
men to horses of and as the were kept off 
by the passing men the dog could eat all it 
wanted  it had been since morning and had seemed 
as if at any moment it might and the sky 
clear but after a short break it began than before 
the road no longer the water which ran along the 
in  pierre walked along looking from side to side 
counting his steps in and them off on his fingers 
mentally addressing the rain he repeated  then now then 
go on  it seemed to him that he was 
thinking of nothing but far down and deep within him 
his soul was occupied with something important and comforting this 
something was a most subtle from a conversation with the 
day before  at their yesterday place feeling by a 
dying pierre had got up and gone to the next 
one which was burning better there was sitting covered up 
and all his as if it were a telling the 
soldiers in his and pleasant though now voice a story 
pierre knew it was already past the hour when was 
usually free of his and particularly lively when pierre reached 
the fire and heard voice by illness and saw his 
pathetic face lit up by the he felt a painful 
at his heart his feeling of pity for this man 
frightened him and he wished to go away but there 
was no other fire and pierre sat down trying not 
to look at   how are you he asked 
  am i if we at god won grant 
us death replied and at once resumed the story he 
had   so brother he continued with a smile 
on his pale face and a particularly happy light in 
his eyes  see brother  pierre had long been 
familiar with that story had told it to him alone 
some half times and always with a specially joyful but 
well as he knew it pierre now listened to that 
tale as to something new and the quiet evidently felt 
as he told it itself also to pierre the story 
was of an old who lived a good and god 
life with his family and who went once to the 
fair with a companion rich  having put up at 
an they both went to sleep and next morning his 
companion was found and with his cut a was found 
under the old he was tried and his having been 
off  in form as put it he was sent 
to hard in   so brother  was at 
this point that pierre came up  years or more 
passed by the old man was living as a convict 
as he should and doing no wrong only he to 
god for death well one night the were gathered just 
as we are with the old man among them and 
they began telling what each was suffering for and how 
they had against god one told how he had taken 
a life another had taken two a third had set 
a house on fire while another had simply been a 
and had done nothing so they asked the old man 
 are you being for my dear said he  
being for my own and other men but i have 
not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine 
but have only helped my i was a my dear 
and had much property  he went on to tell 
them all about it in order  don for myself 
he says  it seems has me only i am 
sorry for my old wife and the children and the 
old man began to now it happened that in the 
group was the very man who had killed the other 
 did it happen he said  and in what 
month he asked all about it and his heart began 
to so he comes up to the old man like 
this and down at his feet  are because of 
me he says  quite true that this man he 
says  being and for nothing i he says  
that deed and i put the under your head while 
you were forgive me he says  sake  paused 
smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire and he 
drew the together   the old man said  
will forgive you we are all in his sight i 
suffer for my own and he wept tears well and 
what do you think dear friends continued his face more 
and more with a rapturous smile as if what he 
now had to tell the chief and the whole meaning 
of his story  do you think dear fellows that 
murderer to the  have taken six lives he says 
 was a great sinner  what i am most 
sorry for is this old man don let him suffer 
because of me so he and it was all written 
down and the papers sent off in form the place 
was a long way off and while they were what 
with one thing and another filling in the papers all 
in form i mean passed the affair reached the after 
a while the came to set the free and give 
him a that had been the paper arrived and they 
began to look for the old man  is the 
old man who has been suffering and in vain a 
paper has come from the so they began looking for 
him here lower trembled  god had already him was 
dead that how it was dear fellows concluded and sat 
for a long time silent gazing before him with a 
smile  and pierre soul was but joyfully filled not 
by the story itself but by its by the rapturous 
joy that lit up face as he told it and 
the of that joy      chapter 
xiv    places  suddenly cried a voice 
        your places 
  a pleasant feeling of excitement and an of 
something joyful and solemn was among the soldiers of the 
and the prisoners from all sides came shouts of command 
and from the left came dressed on good horses passing 
the prisoners at a the expression on all faces showed 
the people feel at the of those in the prisoners 
together and were pushed off the road the formed up 
  emperor the emperor the the and hardly had 
the cavalry passed before a carriage drawn by six gray 
horses rattled by pierre caught a of a man in 
a three hat with a look on his handsome plump 
white face it was one of the his eye fell 
on pierre large and striking figure and in the expression 
with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he 
sympathy and a desire to that sympathy  the general 
in of the after the carriage with a red and 
frightened face up his horse several officers formed a group 
and some soldiers crowded round them their faces all looked 
and   did he say what did he say 
pierre heard them ask  while the was passing the 
prisoners had together in a crowd and pierre saw whom 
he had not yet seen that morning he sat in 
his short against a tree on his face besides the 
look of joyful it had worn yesterday while telling the 
tale of the who there was now an expression of 
quiet solemnity  looked at pierre with his kindly round 
eyes now filled with tears evidently wishing him to come 
near that he might say something to him but pierre 
was not sure of himself he made as if he 
did not notice that look and moved hastily away  
when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round was 
still sitting at the side of the road under the 
tree and two were talking over his head pierre did 
not look round again but went up the hill  
from behind where had been sitting came the sound of 
a pierre heard it plainly but at that moment he 
remembered that he had not yet finished up how many 
still remained to he had before the went by and 
he again started two french soldiers ran past pierre one 
of whom carried a lowered and smoking they both looked 
pale and in the expression on their faces of them 
glanced timidly at pierre was something what he had seen 
on the face of the young at the execution pierre 
looked at the and remembered that two days before that 
man had his shirt while it at the fire and 
how they had laughed at him  behind him where 
had been sitting the dog began to  a stupid 
why is it thought pierre  his comrades the soldiers 
beside him looking back at the place where the had 
been and the dog was just as pierre did but 
there was a set look on all their faces  
    chapter xv   the the 
prisoners and the train stopped at the village of the 
men crowded together round the pierre went up to the 
fire ate some roast lay down with his back to 
the fire and immediately fell he again as he had 
done at after the battle of  again real mingled 
with and again someone he or another gave expression to 
his thoughts and even to the same thoughts that had 
been expressed in his at   is everything life 
is god everything and and that movement is god and 
while there is life there is joy in consciousness of 
the to love life is to love god and more 
than all else is to love this life in one 
sufferings in innocent sufferings   came to pierre mind 
 and suddenly he saw before him a long kindly 
old man who had given him lessons in  a 
bit said the old man and showed pierre a this 
was ball without fixed its whole surface of pressed together 
and all these moved and changed places sometimes several of 
them merging into one sometimes one into many each drop 
tried to spread out and as much space as possible 
but others to do the same compressed it sometimes destroyed 
it and sometimes with it   is life said 
the old teacher   simple and clear it is 
thought pierre  is it i did not know it 
before   is in the midst and each drop 
to so as to him to the greatest and it 
from the surface to the and again there now has 
spread out and do you understand my child said the 
teacher   you understand you shouted a voice and 
pierre up  he lifted himself and sat up a 
frenchman who had just pushed a russian away was by 
the fire engaged in a piece of meat stuck on 
a his sleeves were rolled up and his red hands 
with their short fingers turned the his brown face with 
frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the 
  all the same to him he muttered turning 
quickly to a who stood behind him  get away 
 and the he looked at pierre who turned away 
and gazed into the a the russian the frenchman had 
pushed away was sitting near the fire patting something with 
his hand looking more pierre recognized the blue dog sitting 
beside the its tail   he come said pierre 
 he began but did not finish  suddenly and 
a crowd of in his fancy the look had given 
him as he sat under the tree of the heard 
from that spot of the dog of the guilty faces 
of the two as they ran past him of the 
lowered and smoking and of at this halt he was 
on the point of that had been killed but just 
at that instant he knew not why the came to 
his mind of a summer evening he had spent with 
a beautiful lady on the of his house in and 
without up the of the day or drawing a from 
them pierre closed his eyes seeing a of the country 
in mingled with of and of the and he into 
water so that it closed over his head  before 
he was by shouts and loud and french soldiers were 
running past him   one of them shouted and 
a moment later a crowd of russians pierre  for 
a long time he could not understand what was to 
him all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy 
  dear fellows old soldiers exclaimed weeping as they 
embraced and hussars  the hussars and crowded round the 
prisoners one offered them clothes another and a third pierre 
sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter 
a word he hugged the first who approached him and 
kissed him weeping  dolokhov stood at the of the 
house letting a crowd of disarmed pass by the french 
by all that had happened were talking loudly among themselves 
but as they passed dolokhov who gently his with his 
and watched them with cold eyes that no good they 
became silent on the opposite side stood dolokhov cossack counting 
the prisoners and off each hundred with a line on 
the   many dolokhov asked the cossack   
second hundred replied the cossack    dolokhov kept 
saying having adopted this expression from the french and when 
his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with 
a cruel light        
 along get along   and with a gloomy 
face walked behind some who were carrying the body of 
petya rostov to a hole that had been in the 
garden      chapter xvi   
after the twenty of when the began the flight of 
the french assumed a still more character with men or 
themselves to death at the while carriages with people dressed 
in continued to drive past carrying away the property that 
had been by the emperor and but the process of 
the flight and of the french army went on as 
before  from moscow to the french army of thousand 
men not the guards  did nothing during the whole 
war but was to thirty thousand though not more than 
five thousand had in battle from this beginning the terms 
of the could be determined the french army away and 
perished at the same rate from moscow to from to 
from to the and from the to of the greater 
or of the cold the the of the way or 
any other particular the french army instead of moving in 
three together into one and so went on to the 
end wrote to his emperor  know how far officers 
allow themselves to from the truth in the condition of 
an army and this is what he said   
i it my duty to report to your majesty the 
condition of the corps i have had occasion to observe 
during different of the last two or three days march 
they are almost scarcely a of the soldiers remain with 
the of their the others go off by themselves in 
different directions to find food and escape in general they 
regard as the place where they hope to during the 
last few days many of the men have been seen 
to throw away their and their arms in such a 
state of affairs your may be the interest of your 
majesty service that the army should be rallied at and 
should first of all be from such as cavalry unnecessary 
and material that is no longer in proportion to the 
present forces the soldiers who are worn out with and 
need these as well as a few days rest many 
have died these last days on the road or at 
the this state of things is continually becoming worse and 
makes one fear that unless a is the will no 
longer be under control in case of an   
twenty from   after into which seemed to them 
a promised land the french searching for food killed one 
another their own and when everything had been fled farther 
 they all went without knowing or why they were 
going still less did that napoleon know it for no 
one any orders to him but still he and those 
about him retained their old wrote commands reports and orders 
of the day called one another mon cousin prince d 
de and so on but these orders and reports were 
only on paper nothing in them was acted upon for 
they could not be carried out and though they one 
another or cousins they all felt that they were who 
had done much for which they had now to pay 
and though they pretended to be concerned about the army 
each was thinking only of himself and of how to 
get away quickly and save himself     
 chapter xvii   the movements of the russian 
and french during the from moscow back to the were 
like those in a game of russian in which two 
are and one of them occasionally rings a little bell 
to inform the of his first he rings his bell 
but when he gets into a place he away as 
quietly as he can and often thinking to escape straight 
into his arms  at first while they were still 
moving along the road napoleon made their presence known but 
later when they reached the road they ran holding the 
of their bell often thinking they were escaping ran right 
into the russians  to the of the french flight 
and the russian and the of the horses the chief 
means of the position cavalry not besides as a result 
of the and change of position by each army even 
what information was obtained could not be delivered in time 
if news was received one day that the had been 
in a certain position the day before by the third 
day when something could have been done that army was 
already two days march farther on and in quite another 
position  one army fled and the other there were 
several different for the french and one would have thought 
that during their stay of four days they might have 
learned where the was might have arranged some more advantageous 
plan and something new but after a four days halt 
the with no or again began running along the neither 
to the right nor to the left but along the 
old through and  expecting the from behind and not 
in front the french in their flight and spread out 
over a distance of twenty hours in front of them 
all fled the emperor then the then the the russian 
army expecting napoleon to take the road to the right 
the was the only thing for him to do turned 
to the right and came out onto the at and 
here as in a game of the french ran into 
our seeing their unexpectedly the french fell into and stopped 
short from the but then they resumed their flight their 
comrades who were farther behind then for three days separate 
of the french army  then and then as it 
were the of the russian army they one another all 
their heavy their and half their men and fled getting 
past the russians by night by making to the right 
 who came last had been himself up the of 
which were in way because despite the unfortunate of the 
french or because of it they wished to the floor 
against which they had hurt themselves who had had a 
corps of ten thousand men reached napoleon at with only 
one thousand men left having all the rest and all 
his and having the at night by at a spot 
 from they fled farther along the road to still 
playing at with the army at the they again became 
many were drowned and many but those who got across 
the river fled farther their chief a coat and having 
seated himself in a on alone his the others who 
could do so drove away too leaving those who could 
not to or die      chapter 
xviii   this in a flight of the french 
during which they did all they could to themselves from 
the time they turned onto the road to the day 
their fled from the army none of the movements of 
the crowd had any sense so one might have thought 
that regarding this period of the the who the actions 
of the to the will of one man would have 
found it impossible to make the story of the fit 
their theory but no of have been written by the 
about this and everywhere are described napoleon the and his 
profound which the army as well as the military shown 
by his  the from when he had a free 
road into a well and the road was open to 
him along which kutuzov afterwards him unnecessary along a road 
explained to us as being to profound profound are given 
for his from to then his at is described where 
he is to have been prepared to accept battle and 
take command and to have walked about with a stick 
and said   l il est de faire le 
general  but nevertheless immediately ran away again to its 
fate the of the army he left behind   
       have acted the 
emperor long enough it is time to act   
   the general   then we are 
told of the greatness of soul of the especially of 
greatness of soul in this that he made his way 
by night around through the forest and across the and 
to and nine of his men  and the final 
of the great emperor from his army is to us 
by the as something great and of even that final 
running away described in ordinary language as the lowest of 
which every child is taught to be ashamed of that 
act finds in the language  when it is impossible 
to the very of any farther when actions are clearly 
contrary to all that calls right or even just the 
produce a of   it seems the of right 
and wrong for the  man nothing is wrong there 
is no for which a  man can be  
 grand  say the and there no longer either 
good or but only  and  grand grand is 
good not grand is bad grand is the in their 
of some special called  and napoleon escaping home in 
a warm coat and leaving to those who were not 
merely his comrades but were  his opinion men he 
had brought there grand  and his soul is  
        is great 
        that it 
is great     saw something in himself 
au il a  said he and the whole world 
for fifty years has been repeating  grand napoleon le 
grand au il a       
  the to the is but a step  
 and it to no one that to admit a 
greatness not with the of right and wrong is merely 
to admit one own and  for us with the 
of good and given us by no human actions are 
and there is no greatness where goodness and truth are 
absent      chapter xix   
what russian reading the account of the last part of 
the of  has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of 
regret and who has not asked himself how it is 
that the french were not all captured or destroyed when 
our three them in superior when the french and in 
and when  the the aim of the russians was 
to stop the french to cut them off and them 
all  how was it that the russian army which 
when than the french had given battle at did not 
its purpose when it had the french on three sides 
and when its aim was to them can the french 
be so superior to us that when we had them 
with superior forces we could not beat them how could 
that happen  history  what is called by that 
name to these questions says that this occurred because kutuzov 
and and and this man and that man did not 
such and such  but why did they not those 
and why if they were guilty of not carrying out 
a plan were they not tried and but even if 
we that kutuzov and others were the cause of the 
russian it is still why the position of the russian 
army being what it was at and at the  
both we had superior forces the french army with its 
and emperor was not captured if that was what the 
russians at  the of this strange fact given by 
russian military  the effect that kutuzov an attack is 
for we know that he could not restrain the from 
at and  why was the russian army with forces 
had the in full strength at at and the by 
the of the french when it was superior  if 
the aim of the russians in off and napoleon and 
his that aim was not merely but all to it 
were most this last period of the is quite rightly 
considered by the french to be a of and quite 
considered victorious by russian  the russian military in so 
far as they to of must admit that and in 
spite of their about devotion and so must reluctantly admit 
that the french from moscow was a of for napoleon 
and for kutuzov  but putting vanity entirely aside one 
that such a a since the of french brought the 
french complete while the of russian led to the of 
their and the of their country  the of this 
lies in the fact that the the from the of 
the sovereigns and the from reports and so have to 
this last period of the war of  an aim 
that never that of off and napoleon with his and 
his army  there never was or could have been 
such an aim for it would have been and its 
attainment quite impossible  it would have been first because 
napoleon army was flying from russia with all possible speed 
that is to say was doing just what every russian 
desired so what was the use of on the french 
who were running away as fast as they possibly could 
 it would have been to block the passage of 
men whose whole energy was to flight  it would 
have been to sacrifice one own in order to the 
french army which without was itself at such a rate 
that though its path was not it could not carry 
across the more than it did in a part of 
the army  it would have been to wish to 
take the emperor and would have been in the highest 
degree for the russians as the most of the time 
 de and others recognized still more would have been 
the wish to army corps of the french when our 
own army had away to half before reaching and a 
whole would have been to the corps of prisoners and 
when our men were not always getting full and the 
prisoners already taken were of  all the profound about 
off and napoleon and his army were like the plan 
of a who when out of his garden a that 
had down the he had should run to the and 
hit the on the head the only thing to be 
said in excuse of that would be that he was 
very angry but not even that could be said for 
those who drew up this for it was not they 
who had from the  but besides the fact that 
off napoleon with his army would have been it was 
impossible  it was impossible first because experience shows that 
a three movement of on a never with the of 
kutuzov and a on time at an appointed place was 
so as to be to impossibility as in fact thought 
kutuzov who when he received the plan remarked that over 
great do not the desired  it was impossible because 
to the with which napoleon army was greater forces than 
the russians possessed would have been  it was impossible 
because the military  cut off has no meaning one 
can cut off a of but not an army to 
cut off an army its road quite impossible for there 
is always of room to avoid and there is the 
night when nothing can be seen as the military scientists 
might themselves by the example of and of the it 
is only possible to prisoners if they agree to be 
captured just as it is only possible to catch a 
swallow if it on one hand men can only be 
taken prisoners if they to the of and as the 
did but the french quite rightly did not consider that 
this them since death by and cold them in flight 
or alike  and chiefly it was impossible because never 
since the world began has a war been fought under 
such as those that obtained in  and the russian 
army in its of the french strained its strength to 
the and could not have done more without itself  
during the movement of the russian army from to it 
lost fifty thousand or that is a number equal to 
the of a large town half the men fell out 
of the army without a battle  and it is 
of this period of the the army lacked and was 
short of and without and was out at night for 
months in the snow with fifteen of when there were 
only seven or eight hours of and the rest was 
night in which the influence of cannot be when men 
were taken into that region of death where not for 
a few hours only as in a battle but for 
months where they were every moment death from and cold 
when half the army perished in a single month is 
of this period of the that the tell us how 
should have made a march to such and such a 
place to another place and should have  than knee 
in snow to somewhere else and how so  and 
 off the french and so on and so on 
 the russians half of whom died did all that 
could and should have been done to an end worthy 
of the nation and they are not to because other 
russians sitting in warm rooms that they should do what 
was impossible  all that strange now difficult to understand 
between the and the accounts only because the with the 
matter have written the history of the beautiful words and 
of and not the history of the  to them 
the words of seem very interesting and so do their 
surmises and the this or that general received but the 
question of those fifty thousand men who were left in 
and in does not even interest them for it does 
not come within the of their  yet one need 
only the study of the reports and general and consider 
the movement of those of thousands of men who took 
a direct part in the and all the questions that 
seemed easily and simply receive an and certain  the 
aim of off napoleon and his army never except in 
the of a people it could not exist because it 
was and  the people had a single aim to 
free their land from that aim was in the first 
place of itself as the french ran away and so 
it was only necessary not to stop their flight it 
was by the which was the french and by the 
fact that a large russian army was following the french 
ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped 
 the russian army had to act like a to 
a running animal and the experienced knew it was better 
to hold the raised as a menace than to the 
running animal on the head      
book fifteen         
chapter i   when seeing a dying animal a 
man a sense of horror to his own is before 
his eyes but when it is a and intimate human 
being that is dying besides this horror at the of 
life there is a a wound which like a wound 
is sometimes and sometimes but always aches and at any 
irritating touch  after prince andrew death natasha and princess 
mary alike felt this drooping in spirit and their eyes 
before the menacing cloud of death that them they dared 
not look life in the face they carefully their open 
from any rough and painful everything a carriage passing rapidly 
in the street a summons to dinner the maid inquiry 
what dress to prepare or worse still any word of 
or sympathy seemed an the wound interrupting that necessary quiet 
in which they both tried to listen to the stern 
and dreadful that still in their and their gazing into 
those that for an instant had opened out before them 
 only when alone together were they free from such 
and they spoke little even to one another and when 
they did it was of very matters  both any 
to the future to admit the of a future seemed 
to them to his memory still more carefully did they 
avoid anything to him who was dead it seemed to 
them that what they had lived through and experienced could 
not be expressed in words and that any reference to 
the of his life the majesty and of the that 
had been accomplished before their eyes  continued from speech 
and constant of everything that might lead up to the 
subject on all sides at the of what they might 
not mention before their minds with still greater and what 
they were both feeling  but and complete sorrow is 
as impossible as and complete joy princess mary in her 
position as absolute and of her own fate and and 
of her was the first to be called back to 
life from that of sorrow in which she had dwelt 
for the first she received from her relations to which 
she had to reply the room in which little nicholas 
had been put was and he began to cough came 
to with reports on the state of their affairs and 
with advice and that they should return to moscow to 
the house on the street which had remained and only 
slight life did not stand still and it was necessary 
to live hard as it was for princess mary to 
from the of in which she had lived till then 
and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave 
natasha alone yet the cares of life demanded her attention 
and she to them she went through the accounts with 
with about her and gave orders and made for the 
to moscow  natasha remained alone and from the time 
princess mary began making for held from her too  
princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with 
her to moscow and both parents this for they saw 
their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a 
change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would 
be good for her   am not going anywhere 
natasha replied when this was to her  please just 
leave me alone and she ran out of the room 
with difficulty from tears of vexation and irritation rather than 
of sorrow  after she felt herself deserted by mary 
and alone in her natasha spent most of the time 
in her room by herself sitting up feet and all 
in the corner of the sofa and something with her 
slender nervous fingers and gazing and fixedly at her eyes 
to fall on this exhausted and tormented her but she 
was in absolute need of it as soon as anyone 
entered she got up quickly changed her position and expression 
and picked up a book or some evidently waiting for 
the to go  she felt all the time as 
if she might at any moment that on which a 
terrible too great for her strength was fixed  one 
day toward the end of natasha pale and thin dressed 
in a black gown her hair into a was feet 
and all in the corner of her sofa nervously crumpling 
and smoothing out the end of her while she looked 
at a corner of the door  she was gazing 
in the direction in which he had gone the other 
side of life and that other side of life of 
which she had never before thought and which had seemed 
to her so far away and was now nearer and 
more and more than this side of life where everything 
was either and or suffering and  she was gazing 
where she knew him to be but she could not 
imagine him than as he had been here she now 
saw him again as he had been at at and 
at  she saw his face heard his voice repeated 
his words and her own and sometimes other words they 
might have spoken  there he is lying back in 
an armchair in his velvet cloak his head on his 
thin pale hand his chest is hollow and his shoulders 
raised his lips are firmly closed his eyes and a 
comes and goes on his pale forehead one of his 
legs just perceptibly but rapidly natasha knows that he is 
with terrible  is that like why does he have 
that what does he feel how does it hurt him 
thought natasha he noticed her watching him raised his eyes 
and began to speak seriously   thing would be 
terrible said he  forever to a suffering man it 
would be continual torture and he looked at her natasha 
as usual answered before she had time to think what 
she would say she said  can go on won 
you will get well well  she now saw him 
from the of that scene and what she had then 
felt she recalled his long sad and severe look at 
those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and 
despair in that   agreed natasha now said to 
herself  it would be dreadful if he always continued 
to suffer i said it then only because it would 
have been dreadful for him but he understood it differently 
he thought it would be dreadful for me he then 
still wished to live and feared death and i said 
it so awkwardly and i did not say what i 
meant i thought quite differently had i said what i 
thought i should have said even if he had to 
go on dying to die continually before my eyes i 
should have been happy with what i am now now 
there is nothing did he know that no he did 
not and never will know it and now it will 
never never be possible to put it right and now 
he again seemed to be saying the same words to 
her only in her natasha this time gave him a 
different answer she stopped him and said  for you 
but not for me you know that for me there 
is nothing in life but you and to suffer with 
you is the greatest happiness for me and he took 
her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it 
that terrible evening four days before his death and in 
her she said other tender and words which she might 
have said then but only spoke now  love thee 
thee i love love she said convulsively pressing her hands 
and setting her teeth with a desperate effort  she 
was by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in 
her eyes then she suddenly asked herself to whom she 
was saying this again everything was in hard dry and 
again with a strained frown she peered toward the world 
where he was and now now it seemed to her 
she was the but at the instant when it seemed 
that the was itself to her a loud of the 
door handle struck on her ears her maid entered the 
room quickly and with a frightened look on her face 
and showing no for her   to your papa 
at once please said she with a strange look  
about peter a letter she finished with a sob  
    chapter ii   besides a 
feeling of from everybody natasha was feeling a special from 
the members of her own family all of them father 
mother and sonya so near to her so familiar so 
that all their words and seemed an to the world 
in which she had been living of late and she 
felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with 
she heard words about peter and a but did not 
them   what can happen to them they just 
live their own old quiet and life thought natasha  
as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming 
out of her mother room his face was puckered up 
and with tears he had evidently run out of that 
room to give to the that were him when he 
saw natasha he waved his arms and burst into convulsively 
painful that distorted his soft round face   petya 
go go she is calling and weeping like a child 
and quickly on his legs to a chair he almost 
fell into it his face with his hands  suddenly 
an electric seemed to run through natasha whole being terrible 
struck her heart she felt a dreadful as if something 
was being inside her and she were dying but the 
was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the 
that had prevented her taking part in life the sight 
of her father the wild of her mother that she 
heard through the door made her immediately forget herself and 
her own  she ran to her father but he 
feebly waved his arm pointing to her mother door princess 
mary pale and with quivering came out from that room 
and taking natasha by the arm said something to her 
natasha neither saw nor heard her she went in with 
steps at the door for an instant as if with 
herself and then ran to her mother  the countess 
was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward 
position out and her head against the wall sonya and 
the maids were holding her arms   natasha cried 
the countess  not true it not true he lying 
natasha she pushing those around her away  away all 
of you it not true killed it not true  
natasha put one knee on the armchair stooped over her 
mother embraced her and with strength raised her turned her 
face toward herself and clung to her   darling 
i am here my she kept on not an instant 
 she did not let go of her mother but 
tenderly with her demanded a and hot water and unfastened 
and open her mother dress   darling my precious 
she whispered kissing her head her hands her face and 
feeling her own and tears her nose and  the 
countess pressed her daughter hand closed her eyes and became 
quiet for a moment suddenly she sat up with glanced 
around her and seeing natasha began to press her daughter 
head with all her strength then she turned toward her 
daughter face which was with and gazed long at it 
  you love me she said in a soft 
whisper  you would not me you tell me the 
whole truth  natasha looked at her with eyes full 
of tears and in her look there was nothing but 
love and an entreaty for forgiveness   darling she 
repeated all the power of her love to find some 
way of taking on herself the of that her mother 
 and again in a with her mother to believe 
that she could live when her boy was killed in 
the of life from into a world of  natasha 
did not remember how that day passed nor that night 
nor the next day and night she did not sleep 
and did not leave her mother her and patient love 
seemed completely to the countess every moment not explaining or 
consoling but her to life  during the third night 
the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes and 
natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair 
and closed her eyes but opened them again on hearing 
the creak the countess was sitting up in bed and 
speaking softly   glad i am you have come 
you are tired won you have some tea natasha went 
up to her  have in looks and grown more 
continued the countess taking her daughter hand   what 
are you saying   he is no more no 
more  and embracing her daughter the countess began to 
for the first time      chapter 
iii   princess mary her sonya and the count 
tried to natasha but could not they saw that she 
alone was able to restrain her mother from despair for 
three natasha remained constantly at her mother side on a 
chair in her room making her eat and drink and 
talking to her because the mere sound of her tender 
tones her mother  the mother spirit could not petya 
death had from her half her life when the news 
of petya death had come she had been a fresh 
and vigorous woman of fifty but a month later she 
left her room a listless old woman taking no interest 
in life but the same blow that almost killed the 
countess this second blow restored natasha to life  a 
wound produced by a of the body is like a 
wound and strange as it may seem just as a 
deep wound may and its join and alike can yet 
completely only as the result of a force from within 
 natasha wound in that way she thought her life 
was ended but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed 
her that the of life still active within her love 
and so did life  prince andrew last days had 
princess mary and natasha together this new sorrow brought them 
still closer to one another princess mary put off her 
and for three looked after natasha as if she had 
been a child the last passed in her mother had 
strained natasha strength  one noticing natasha with princess mary 
took her to her own room and made her lie 
down on the bed natasha lay down but when princess 
mary had drawn the and was going away she called 
her back   don want to sleep mary sit 
by me a little   are tired to sleep 
  no why did you bring me away she 
will be asking for me   is much better 
she spoke so well today said princess mary  natasha 
lay on the bed and in the of the room 
scanned princess mary face   she like him thought 
natasha  like and yet not like but she is 
quite strange new and and she me what is in 
her heart all that is good but how what is 
her mind like what does she think about me yes 
she is splendid   she said timidly drawing princess 
mary hand to herself  you think me wicked no 
mary darling how i love you let us be quite 
quite friends  and natasha embracing her began kissing her 
face and hands making princess mary feel shy but happy 
by this of her  from that day a tender 
and passionate friendship such as only between women was between 
princess mary and natasha they were continually kissing and saying 
tender things to one another and spent most of their 
time together when one went out the other became and 
hastened to her together they felt more in with one 
another than either of them felt with herself when alone 
a feeling than friendship up between them an feeling of 
life being possible only in each other presence  sometimes 
they were silent for hours sometimes after they were already 
in bed they would begin talking and go on till 
morning they spoke most of what was long past princess 
mary spoke of her childhood of her mother her father 
and her and natasha who with a lack of understanding 
had turned away from that life of devotion and the 
of christian self now feeling herself to princess mary by 
affection learned to love her past too and to understand 
a side of life to her she did not think 
of applying and self to her own life for she 
was accustomed to other joys but she understood and loved 
in another those for princess mary listening to natasha of 
childhood and early youth there also opened out a new 
and side of life in life and its enjoyment  
just as before they never mentioned him so as not 
to lower  they thought their by words but this 
silence about him had the effect of making them gradually 
begin to forget him without being conscious of it  
natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak 
that they all talked about her health and this pleased 
her but sometimes she was suddenly by fear not only 
of death but of weakness and of good looks and 
she examined her bare arm carefully surprised at its and 
in the morning noticed her drawn and as it seemed 
to her piteous face in her glass it seemed to 
her that things must be so and yet it was 
sad  one day she went quickly upstairs and found 
herself out of she immediately a reason for going down 
and then her strength ran upstairs again the result  
another time when she called her voice trembled so she 
called again she could hear coming her in the deep 
chest tones in which she had been to sing and 
listened attentively to herself  she did not know and 
would not have believed it but beneath the of that 
covered her soul and seemed to her delicate young of 
grass were already which taking root would so with their 
living the that her down that it would soon no 
longer be seen or noticed the wound had to from 
within  at the end of princess mary left for 
moscow and the count on natasha going with her to 
consult the doctors      chapter iv 
  after the at where kutuzov had been unable 
to hold back his in their anxiety to and cut 
off the and so on the farther movement of the 
french and of the russians who them continued as far 
as without a battle the flight was so that the 
russian army the french could not keep up with them 
cavalry and horses broke down and the information received of 
the movements of the french was never  the men 
in the russian army were so worn out by this 
at the rate of twenty a day that they could 
not go any  to the degree of of the 
russian army it is only necessary to clearly the meaning 
of the fact that while not losing more than five 
thousand killed and after and less than a hundred prisoners 
the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand 
strong reached with only fifty thousand  the of the 
russian was just as to our army as the flight 
of the french was to the only difference was that 
the russian army moved with no such threat of as 
over the french and that the were left behind in 
hands while the russians left behind were among their own 
people the chief cause of the of napoleon army was 
the of its movement and a of this is the 
of the russian army  kutuzov as far as was 
in his power instead of trying to check the movement 
of the french as was desired in petersburg and by 
the russian army his whole here as he had done 
at and to it on while the movement of our 
army  but besides this since the and enormous of 
the army by the of the had become evident another 
reason for the and itself to kutuzov the aim of 
the russian army was to the french the road the 
french would take was and so the closer our on 
their heels the greater distance they had to only by 
following at some distance could one cut across the path 
of the french all the suggested by our meant fresh 
movements of the army and a of its the only 
aim was to those to that end kutuzov was during 
the whole from moscow to or but so that he 
never once from it  kutuzov felt and knew by 
or science but with the whole of his russian being 
every russian felt that the french were that the was 
flying and must be driven out but at the same 
time he like the soldiers realized all the of this 
march the of which was for such a time of 
the year  but to the especially the foreign ones 
in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves to 
somebody and for some reason to a king or a 
seemed that now any battle must be horrible and the 
very time to fight and conquer somebody kutuzov merely shrugged 
his shoulders when one after another they of to be 
made with those soldiers and half within a month and 
without a battle had to half their number and who 
at the best if the flight continued would have to 
go a greater distance than they had already before they 
reached the  this to distinguish themselves to to and 
to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians on 
the french army  so it was at where they 
expected to find one of the three french and instead 
on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men despite all kutuzov 
to avoid that and to his the of the broken 
of french soldiers by worn russians continued at for three 
days  wrote a disposition  first will march to 
so and so and as usual nothing happened in accord 
with the disposition prince of from a hill over the 
french that were running past and demanded which did not 
arrive the french the russians dispersed and hid themselves in 
the forest by night making their way round as best 
they could and continued their flight  who said he 
did not want to know anything about the affairs of 
his and could never be found when he was wanted 
 as he himself was fond of with the french 
sent their wasted time and did not do what he 
was ordered to do       
 without fear and without reproach    give 
you that he said up to the and pointing out 
the french to the cavalry  and the cavalry with 
spurs and on horses that could scarcely move with much 
effort to the to them is to say to a 
crowd of with cold and the that had been to 
them threw down its arms and as it had long 
been anxious to do  at they took twenty thousand 
prisoners several hundred and a stick called a  staff 
and as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased 
with their they much not having taken napoleon or at 
least a or a hero of some sort and one 
another and especially kutuzov for having failed to do so 
 these men carried away by their were but of 
the most melancholy law of necessity but considered themselves and 
imagined that they were a most noble and honorable deed 
they kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of 
the he had prevented their napoleon that he thought of 
nothing but his and would not from the linen because 
he was comfortable there that at he checked the because 
on learning that napoleon was there he had quite lost 
his head and that it was that he had an 
understanding with napoleon and had been by him and so 
on and so on  not only did his carried 
away by their talk in this way but and history 
have napoleon as grand while kutuzov is described by as 
a weak old and by russians as something sort of 
only because he had a russian name    
  chapter v   in  and  
kutuzov was of the emperor was dissatisfied with him and 
in a history recently written by order of the highest 
it is said that kutuzov was a court frightened of 
the name of napoleon and that by his at and 
the he the russian army of the glory of complete 
over the french        
  history of the year  the character of 
kutuzov and      reflections on the 
of the at      by  
 such is the fate not of great men  
whom the russian mind does not but of those rare 
and always who the will of their will to it 
the hatred and of the crowd such men for the 
higher  for russian strange and terrible to say napoleon 
most insignificant of history who never anywhere even in exile 
showed human dignity is the object of and enthusiasm he 
is grand but kutuzov man who from the beginning to 
the end of his in  never once by word 
or deed from to an example exceptional in history of 
self and a present consciousness of the future importance of 
what was seems to them something and and when speaking 
of him and of the year  they always seem 
a little ashamed  and yet it is difficult to 
imagine an character whose was so to a single aim 
and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more 
worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole 
people still more difficult would it be to find an 
in history of the aim of an being so completely 
accomplished as that to which all kutuzov were in  
 kutuzov never talked of  looking down from the 
of the he offered for the or of what he 
intended to or had accomplished in general he said nothing 
about himself adopted no always appeared to be the simplest 
and most ordinary of men and said the simplest and 
most ordinary things he wrote to his daughters and to 
madame de read liked the society of pretty women with 
officers and soldiers and never those who tried to prove 
anything to him when count at the bridge up to 
kutuzov with for having the of moscow and said  
was it you promised not to moscow without a battle 
kutuzov replied  i shall not moscow without a battle 
though moscow was then already when coming to him from 
the emperor said that ought to be appointed chief of 
the kutuzov replied  i was just saying so myself 
though a moment before he had said quite the contrary 
what did it matter to him then alone amid a 
crowd understood the whole tremendous of what was did it 
matter to him whether the of moscow to him or 
to himself still less could it matter to him who 
was appointed chief of the  not merely in these 
but continually did that old man by experience of life 
had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving 
as their expression are not what move people quite meaningless 
words that happened to enter his head  but that 
man so of his words did not once during the 
whole time of his utter one word with the single 
aim toward which he moved the whole war obviously in 
spite of himself in very circumstances he expressed his real 
thoughts with the conviction that he would not be understood 
beginning with the battle of from which time his with 
those about him began he alone said that the battle 
of was a and repeated this both and in his 
and reports up to the time of his death he 
alone said that the of moscow is not the of 
russia in reply to of peace he said there can 
be no peace for such is the people will he 
alone during the of the french said that all our 
are everything is being accomplished of itself better than we 
could desire that the must be offered  bridge that 
neither the the nor the were necessary that we must 
keep some force to reach the with and that he 
would not sacrifice a single russian for ten  and 
this as he is described to us who lies to 
to please the emperor he alone the emperor in that 
to carry the war the is and  nor do 
words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of 
the his actions the all to one and the same 
end  to all his strength for with the french 
 to them and  to drive them out of 
russia as far as possible the sufferings of our people 
and of our army  this kutuzov whose was  
and time this of gave battle at the for it 
with solemnity this kutuzov who before the battle of began 
said that it would be lost he alone in to 
everyone else declared till his death that was a despite 
the assurance of that the battle was lost and despite 
the fact that for an army to have to retire 
after winning a battle was he alone during the whole 
that which were then should not be fought and that 
a new war should not be nor the of russia 
 it is easy now to understand the of these 
only we from to the of the that only in 
the heads of a the and now lie before us 
 but how did that old man alone in to 
the general opinion so truly the importance of the people 
of the that in all his he was never once 
to it  the of that extraordinary power of the 
meaning of the then lay in the feeling which he 
possessed in full and strength  only the of the 
fact that he possessed this feeling the people in so 
strange a manner contrary to the wish to him old 
man in be their in the war and only that 
feeling placed him on that highest human from which he 
the commander in chief devoted all his not to and 
men but to and showing pity on them  that 
simple modest and therefore truly great figure could not be 
in the of a hero of men history has  
to a lackey no man can be great for a 
lackey has his own of greatness     
 chapter vi   the of was the first 
day of what is called the battle of toward evening 
much and many made by who did not go to 
their proper places and after adjutants had been sent about 
with it had become plain that the was everywhere in 
flight and that there could and would be no battle 
kutuzov left and went to his had that day been 
transferred  the day was clear and kutuzov to on 
his plump little white horse followed by an enormous of 
who whispered among themselves behind his back all along the 
road groups of french prisoners captured that day  were 
seven thousand of them were crowding to warm themselves at 
near an immense crowd of tattered prisoners with talk and 
wrapped and in anything they had been able to get 
hold of were standing in the road beside a long 
row of french at the of the commander in chief 
the of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on 
kutuzov who wearing a white cap with a red band 
and a that on his round shoulders moved slowly along 
the road on his white horse one of the was 
to him where the and prisoners had been captured  
kutuzov seemed and did not listen to what the general 
was saying he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied 
look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners 
who a specially wretched appearance most of them were by 
and and nearly all had red and eyes  one 
group of the french stood close to the road and 
two of them one of whom had his face covered 
with were a piece of with their hands there was 
something horrible and in the glance they threw at the 
and in the expression with which after a glance at 
kutuzov the with the immediately turned away and went on 
with what he was doing  kutuzov looked long and 
at these two soldiers he puckered his face screwed up 
his eyes and pensively swayed his head at another spot 
he noticed a russian patting a frenchman on the shoulder 
saying something to him in a friendly manner and kutuzov 
with the same expression on his face again swayed his 
head   were you saying he asked the general 
who continuing his report the commander in chief attention to 
some captured from the french and standing in front of 
the regiment   the said kutuzov evidently himself with 
difficulty from the thoughts that him  he looked about 
him thousands of eyes were looking at him from all 
sides awaiting a word from him  he stopped in 
front of the regiment deeply and closed his eyes one 
of his to the soldiers carrying the to and the 
commander in chief with them kutuzov was silent for a 
few and then with evident to the duty by his 
position raised his head and began to speak a of 
officers him he looked attentively around at the circle of 
officers several of them   thank you all he 
said addressing the soldiers and then again the officers in 
the around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard 
 thank you all for your hard and faithful service 
the is complete and russia will not forget you honor 
to you forever  he paused and looked around  
 its head lower it he said to a who 
had lowered the french he was holding before the  
lower that it he added addressing the men with a 
movement of his   thousands of voices  while 
the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his and 
bowed his head and his eye lit up with a 
and apparently gleam   see said he when the 
shouts had ceased and all at once his voice and 
the expression of his face changed it was no longer 
the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man 
who wanted to tell his comrades something very important  
there was a stir among the of officers and in 
the ranks of the soldiers who moved that they might 
hear better what he was going to say   
see i know it hard for you but it can 
be helped bear up it won be for long now 
we see our visitors off and then we rest the 
won forget your service it is hard for you but 
still you are at home while they see what they 
have come to said he pointing to the prisoners  
off than our while they were strong we didn spare 
ourselves but now we may even pity them they are 
human too isn it so  he looked around and 
in the direct wondering fixed upon him he read sympathy 
with what he had said his face grew and with 
an old man smile which drew the corners of his 
lips and eyes into a of wrinkles he ceased speaking 
and bowed his head as if in   after 
all who asked them here serves them right the he 
cried suddenly lifting his head  and his he off 
at a for the first time during the whole and 
left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and 
shouting   kutuzov words were hardly understood by the 
no one could have repeated the field solemnly and then 
changing into an old man talk but the hearty of 
that speech the feeling of with pity for the foe 
and consciousness of the of our cause exactly expressed by 
that old man good was not merely understood but lay 
in the soul of every and found expression in their 
joyous and long shouts afterwards when one of the addressed 
kutuzov asking whether he wished his to be sent for 
kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob being evidently greatly 
moved      chapter vii   
when the reached their night place on the of the 
last day of the it was already growing all day 
it had been calm and with lightly falling snow and 
toward evening it began to clear through the falling snow 
a and sky showed itself and the grew  an 
infantry regiment which had left three thousand strong but now 
only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive 
that night at its place village on the the who 
met the regiment announced that all the were full of 
and dead and members of the staff there was only 
one for the commander  the commander up to his 
the regiment passed through the village and its arms in 
front of the last  like some huge many animal 
the regiment began to prepare its and its food one 
part of it dispersed and knee through the snow into 
a forest to the right of the village and immediately 
the sound of and the of branches and merry voices 
could be heard from there another section amid the and 
horses which were standing in a group was busy getting 
out and and the horses a third section through the 
village arranging for the staff officers carrying out the french 
that were in the and away dry wood and from 
the for the or to serve for  some fifteen 
men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wall 
of a the of which had already been removed  
 then all together cried the voices and the huge 
surface of the wall with snow and with was seen 
swaying in the of the night the lower cracked more 
and more and at last the wall fell and with 
it the men who had been pushing it loud coarse 
laughter and joyous shouts ensued   then catch hold 
in hand up the that it where are you to 
  all together but wait a moment boys with 
a song  all stood silent and a soft pleasant 
voice began to sing at the end of the third 
as the last note died away twenty voices out at 
once  that it all together away boys but despite 
their the hardly moved and in the silence that followed 
the heavy breathing of the men was audible   
you of the company that you are a hand will 
you you may want us one of these days  
some twenty men of the company who were on their 
way into the village joined the and the wall which 
was about thirty feet long and seven feet high moved 
forward along the village street swaying pressing upon and the 
shoulders of the men   along falling what are 
you stopping for there now  merry words of  
 are you up to suddenly came the voice of 
a major who came upon the men who were their 
burden  are here the general himself is in that 
and you you i give it to you shouted he 
the first man who came in his way a blow 
on the back  you make less noise  the 
men became silent the who had been struck and his 
face which had been till it by his falling against 
the   how that devil out he made my 
face all said he in a frightened whisper when the 
major had passed on   you like it said 
a laughing voice and their tones the men moved forward 
 when they were out of the village they began 
talking again as loud as before their talk with the 
same  in the which the men had passed the 
chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over 
their tea about the of the day and the suggested 
for tomorrow it was to make a march to the 
left cut off the  and him  by the 
time the soldiers had the to its place the were 
on all sides ready for the wood the snow was 
and black of soldiers to and fro all over the 
occupied space where the snow had been trodden down  
and were all around everything was done without any orders 
being given of wood were brought for the night were 
up for the officers were being and and put in 
order  the wall the men had brought was set 
up in a by the company as a from the 
north up by and a was built before it they 
beat the called the had supper and settled down round 
the for the night their some smoking pipes and some 
themselves to the out of their     
 chapter viii   one would have thought that 
under the almost wretched the russian soldiers were in at 
that time warm and without a over their heads in 
the snow with of and without even full  did 
not always keep up with the would have a very 
sad and  on the contrary the army had never 
under the best material a more cheerful and animated this 
was because all who began to grow depressed or who 
lost strength were out of the army day by day 
all the physically or morally weak had long since been 
left behind and only the flower of the army and 
mentally  more men behind the of the company than 
anywhere else two major were sitting with them and their 
than others for leave to sit by their they demanded 
of   what has become of you you son 
of a are you lost or have the you some 
more wood shouted a red and red man screwing up 
his eyes and because of the smoke but not moving 
back from the fire  you go and some wood 
said he to another  this red man was neither 
a nor a but being he ordered about those than 
himself the they called  a thin little fellow with 
a sharp nose rose and was about to go but 
at that instant there came into the light of the 
fire the slender handsome figure of a young carrying a 
of wood   it here fine  they up 
the wood pressed it down on the fire at it 
with their and it with the of their making the 
and the men drew nearer and lit their pipes the 
handsome young who had brought the wood setting his arms 
began his cold feet rapidly and on the spot where 
he stood   the is cold but clear it 
well that i a he sang to after each syllable 
  out your will fly off shouted the red 
man noticing that the sole of the was hanging  
a fellow you are for dancing  the stopped pulled 
off the piece of and threw it on the fire 
  enough friend said he and having sat down 
took out of his a of blue french and wrapped 
it round his foot  the that them he added 
out his feet toward the fire   soon be 
us new ones they say that when we finished hammering 
them we to receive   that son of a 
has behind after all it seems said one major  
 had an eye on him this long while said 
the other   he a poor sort of  
 in the third company they say nine men were 
missing yesterday   it all very well but when 
a man feet are how can he walk   
don talk nonsense said a major   you want 
to be doing the same said an old turning to 
the man who had spoken of feet   you 
know said the sharp man they called in a and 
voice raising himself at the other side of the fire 
 plump man gets thin but for a thin one 
it death take me now i got no strength left 
he added with resolution turning to the major  them 
to send me to hospital i all over i be 
able to keep up   do that do replied 
the major quietly  the said no more and the 
talk went on   a lot of those were 
taken today and the fact is that not one of 
them had what you might call real on said a 
starting a new  were no more than make  
 have taken their they were the for the colonel 
and carried them out it was to see them boys 
put in the  they turned them over one seemed 
still and would you believe it he something in their 
  they a clean the first man went on 
 was white white as some of them are such 
fine fellows you might think they were   what 
do you think they make soldiers of all there  
 they don understand our talk at all said the 
with a smile  asked him whose subject he was 
and he in his own way a queer lot  
 it strange friends continued the man who had wondered 
at their  at were saying that when they began 
the dead the battle was you know those dead had 
been lying there for nearly a month and says the 
 lie as white as paper clean and not as 
much smell as a of smoke   it from 
the cold asked someone   a clever fellow from 
the cold indeed why it was hot if it had 
been from the cold ours would not have either  
he says  up to ours and they are all 
and so he says  tie our faces up with 
and turn our heads away as we them off we 
can hardly do it but he says  white as 
paper and not so much smell as a of  
all were silent   must be from their food 
said the major  used to the same food as 
the  no one him   near where the 
battle was said the men were all called up from 
ten around and they for twenty days and still didn 
finish the dead away and as for the he says 
  was a real battle said an old  
the only one worth but since that it only been 
  do you know the day before yesterday we 
ran at them and my word they didn let us 
get near before they just threw down their and went 
on their knees  they say that only one case 
they say took  himself twice but he didn know 
the right he him and him good he into a 
in his hands and away and there no way of 
him either   a first when i come to 
look at you   indeed it the real truth 
  he fell into my hands when i caught 
him i him in the ground with an stake to 
him down what a lot of men he   
we going to end it he won come here again 
remarked the old  the conversation and the soldiers began 
settling down to sleep   at the stars it 
wonderful how they you would think the women had spread 
out their linen said one of the men gazing with 
at the way   a sign of a good 
next year   shall want some more wood  
 warm your back and your gets that queer  
   are you pushing for is the fire 
only for you look how he  in the silence 
that ensued the of those who had could be heard 
others turned over and themselves now and again exchanging a 
few words from a a hundred off came a sound 
of general merry laughter   at them there in 
the company said one of the soldiers  what a 
lot of them there are  one of the men 
got up and went over to the company   
having such fun said he coming back  have turned 
up one quite and the other an awful he  
 i go across and have a look  and 
several of the men went over to the company  
    chapter ix   the company 
was at the very edge of the forest a huge 
was in the midst of the snow up the branches 
of heavy with  about they heard the sound of 
steps in the snow of the forest and the of 
dry branches   bear said one of the men 
 they all raised their heads to listen and out 
of the forest into the bright stepped two human to 
one another  these were two who had been hiding 
in the forest they came up to the fire uttering 
something in a language our soldiers did not understand one 
was than the other he wore an officer hat and 
seemed quite exhausted on approaching the fire he had been 
going to sit down but fell the other a short 
with a shawl tied round his head was he raised 
his companion and said something pointing to his mouth the 
soldiers the spread a on the ground for the man 
and brought some and for both of them  the 
exhausted french officer was and the man with his head 
wrapped in the shawl was his  when had drunk 
some and finished his of he suddenly became unnaturally merry 
and to the soldiers who could not understand him refused 
food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent 
beside the looking at the russian soldiers with red and 
vacant eyes occasionally he a long and then again became 
silent pointing to his shoulders tried to on the soldiers 
the fact that was an officer and ought to be 
a russian officer who had come up to the fire 
sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take 
a french officer into his to warm him and when 
the returned and said that the colonel wished the officer 
to be brought to him was told to go he 
rose and tried to walk but and would have had 
not a standing by held him up   won 
do it again eh said one of the soldiers winking 
and turning to   you fool why talk that 
you are real came from all sides addressed to the 
 they lifted him on the arms of two soldiers 
and carried him to the put his arms around their 
while they carried him and began   you fine 
fellows my kind kind friends these are men oh my 
kind friends and he leaned his head against the shoulder 
of one of the men like a child  meanwhile 
was sitting in the best place by the fire by 
the soldiers  a short frenchman with and eyes was 
wearing a woman cloak and had a shawl tied woman 
fashion round his head over his cap he was evidently 
tipsy and was a french song in a broken voice 
with an arm thrown round the the soldiers simply held 
their sides as they watched him   then now

to eat   him some it takes a long 
time to get filled up after  they gave him 
some more and with a laugh set to work on 
his third all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they 
watched him the older men who thought it to themselves 
with such nonsense continued to lie at the opposite side 
of the fire but one would occasionally himself on an 
elbow and glance at with a smile   are 
men too said one of them as he wrapped himself 
up in his coat  on its own root  
 o how it is tremendous that means a hard 
 they all grew silent the stars as if knowing 
that no one was looking at them began to themselves 
in the dark sky now flaring up now now they 
were busy something and to one another    
  chapter x   the french army away 
at the uniform rate of a and that crossing of 
the about which so much has been written was only 
one in its and not at all the of the 
if so much has been and still is written about 
the on the french side this is only because at 
the broken bridge across that river the their army had 
been were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a that 
remained in every memory and on the russian side merely 
because in petersburg from the seat of war plan  
one of had been to catch napoleon in a trap 
at the river everyone himself that all would happen to 
plan and therefore that it was just the crossing of 
the that destroyed the french army in the of the 
crossing were much less to the french and men lost 
had been as the show  the sole importance of 
the crossing of the lies in the fact that it 
plainly and the of all the for off the and 
the of the only possible line of one kutuzov and 
the general of the army demanded simply to follow the 
up the french crowd fled at a continually speed and 
all its energy was to reaching its goal it fled 
like a animal and it was impossible to block its 
path this was shown not so much by the it 
made for crossing as by what took place at the 
when the broke down soldiers people from moscow and women 
with children who were with the french all on by 
forward into boats and into the ice water and did 
not  that impulse was the condition of and of 
was bad as long as they remained with their own 
people each might hope for help from his fellows and 
the definite place he held among them but those who 
while remaining in the same would be on a lower 
to a in the of life the french did not 
need to be of the fact that half the prisoners 
whom the russians did not know what to do of 
cold and despite their desire to save them they felt 
that it could not be the most russian those to 
the french even the in the russian service do nothing 
for the prisoners the french perished from the to which 
the russian army was itself exposed it was impossible to 
take and clothes from our and soldiers to give to 
the french who though not or or guilty were simply 
unnecessary some russians even did that but they were  
certain lay behind the french but in front there was 
hope their had been there was no save in flight 
and on that the whole strength of the french was 
concentrated  the farther they fled the more wretched became 
the of the especially after the on which  of 
the petersburg plan special had been placed by the russians 
and the grew the of the russian who one another 
and kutuzov most of all that the of the petersburg 
plan would be to kutuzov led to and more and 
more strongly expressed the and were of course expressed in 
a form making it impossible for him to ask he 
was to they did not talk seriously to him when 
to him or asking for his they appeared to be 
a but they behind his back and tried to him 
at every turn  because they could not understand him 
all these people assumed that it was to talk to 
the old man that he would never the of their 
that he would answer with his phrases  they thought 
were mere phrases about a  bridge about the impossibility 
of crossing the with a crowd of and so they 
had heard all that before and all he said it 
was necessary to or that the men had no so 
simple while what they was so and clever that it 
was evident that he was old and stupid and that 
they though not in power were of  after the 
with the army of the brilliant and petersburg hero this 
mood and the gossip of the staff reached their kutuzov 
saw this and merely and shrugged his shoulders only once 
after the affair of the did he get angry and 
write to  separately to the emperor the following letter 
  account of your of ill health will your 
excellency please be so good as to set off for 
on of this and there further commands and from his 
imperial majesty  but after the grand joined the army 
he had taken part in the beginning of the but 
had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov now 
having come to the army he kutuzov of the emperor 
at the poor success of our forces and the of 
their the emperor intended to join the army personally in 
a few days time  the old man experienced in 
court as well as in military affairs same kutuzov who 
in august had been commander in chief against the sovereign 
wishes and who had removed the grand and heir from 
the army on his own and contrary to the emperor 
will had decided on the of moscow now realized at 
once that his day was over that his part was 
played and that the power he was to hold was 
no longer his and he understood this not merely from 
the attitude of the court he saw on the one 
hand that the military business in which he had played 
his part was ended and felt that his was accomplished 
and at the same time he began to be conscious 
of the weariness of his aged body and of the 
necessity of rest  on the twenty of kutuzov entered 
 as he called it twice during his career kutuzov 
had been of in that wealthy town which had not 
been he found old friends and associations besides the of 
life of which he had so long been and he 
suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and 
as far as the that around him allowed himself in 
the quiet life to which he had been accustomed as 
if all that was taking place and all that had 
still to be done in the of history did not 
him at all  one of the most  and 
 who had first wanted to effect a in and 
then in but never wished to go where he was 
sent noted for the boldness with which he spoke to 
the emperor and who considered kutuzov to be under an 
obligation to him because when he was sent to make 
peace with in  of kutuzov and found that peace 
had already been concluded he to the emperor that the 
of that peace was really kutuzov this was the first 
to meet kutuzov at the where the latter was to 
stay in naval uniform with a and holding his cap 
under his arm he kutuzov a report and the of 
the town the contemptuously attitude of the younger men to 
the old man in his was expressed in the highest 
degree by the behavior of who knew of the that 
were being against kutuzov  when speaking to kutuzov mentioned 
that the with china that had been captured from him 
at had been and would be restored to him  
 mean to that i have nothing to eat out 
of on the contrary i can supply you with everything 
even if you want to give dinner parties warmly replied 
who tried by every word he spoke to prove his 
own and therefore imagined kutuzov to be animated by the 
same desire  kutuzov shrugging his shoulders replied with his 
subtle smile  meant merely to say what i said 
 contrary to the emperor wish kutuzov detained the greater 
part of the army at those about him said that 
he became and physically during his stay in that town 
he attended to army affairs reluctantly left everything to his 
and while awaiting the emperor arrival led a dissipated life 
 having left petersburg on the of with his prince 
and others emperor reached on the and in his drove 
straight to the in spite of the severe some hundred 
and staff officers in full uniform stood in front of 
the as well as a of honor of the semenov 
regiment  a courier who to the in in a 
with three horses shouted  and rushed into the to 
inform kutuzov who was waiting in the hall porter little 
 a minute later the old man large stout figure 
in full uniform his chest covered with orders and a 
scarf drawn round his out into the porch he put 
on his hat with its to the sides and holding 
his gloves in his hand and with an effort sideways 
down the steps to the of the street took in 
his hand the report he had prepared for the emperor 
 there was running to and fro and another up 
and then all eyes were turned on an approaching in 
which the of the emperor and could already be  
from the habit of fifty years all this had a 
physically agitating effect on the old general he carefully and 
hastily felt himself all over readjusted his hat and pulling 
himself together drew himself up and at the very moment 
when the emperor having from the lifted his eyes to 
him him the report and began speaking in his ingratiating 
voice  the emperor with a glance scanned kutuzov from 
head to foot frowned for an instant but immediately himself 
went up to the old man his arms and embraced 
him and this embrace too to a long related to 
his had its usual effect on kutuzov and he gave 
a sob  the emperor greeted the officers and the 
semenov and again pressing the old man hand went with 
him into the  when alone with the field the 
emperor expressed his at the of the and at the 
made at and the and him of his intentions for 
a future abroad kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark the 
same look with which he had listened to the emperor 
commands on the field of seven years before settled on 
his face now  when kutuzov came out of the 
study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with 
his heavy waddling he was by someone voice saying  
 serene  kutuzov raised his head and looked for 
a long while into the eyes of count who stood 
before him holding a silver on which lay a small 
object kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of 
him  suddenly he seemed to remember a scarcely perceptible 
smile flashed across his face and low and respectfully he 
took the object that lay on the it was the 
order of st george of the first class   
   chapter xi   next day the 
field gave a dinner and ball which the emperor by 
his presence kutuzov had received the order of st george 
of the first class and the emperor showed him the 
highest but everyone knew of the imperial with him the 
were observed and the emperor was the first to set 
that example but everybody understood that the old man was 
and good when kutuzov to a custom of catherine day 
ordered the that had been captured to be lowered at 
the emperor feet on his entering the ballroom the emperor 
made a face and muttered something in which some people 
caught the words  old  the emperor with kutuzov 
was specially at by the fact that kutuzov evidently could 
not or would not understand the importance of the coming 
 when on the following morning the emperor said to 
the officers assembled about him  have not only russia 
you have europe they all understood that the war was 
not ended  kutuzov alone would not see this and 
expressed his opinion that no fresh war could the position 
or add to the glory of russia but could only 
spoil and lower the position that russia had gained he 
tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of fresh 
spoke of the already endured by the people of the 
of and so  this being the field frame of 
mind he was naturally regarded as merely a and to 
the war  to avoid unpleasant with the old man 
the natural method was to do what had been done 
with him at and with at the beginning of the 
russian the to the emperor himself thus the ground from 
under the commander in chief feet without the old man 
by him of the change  with this object his 
staff was gradually and its real strength removed and transferred 
to the emperor and received fresh everyone spoke loudly of 
the field great weakness and health  his health had 
to be bad for his place to be taken away 
and given to another and in fact his health was 
poor  so naturally simply and gradually as he had 
come from to the in petersburg to the and then 
to the army when he was there when his part 
was played out kutuzov place was taken by a new 
and necessary  the war of  besides its dear 
to every russian heart was now to another a  
the movement of from west to east was to be 
succeeded by a movement of from east to west and 
for this fresh war another was necessary having qualities and 
views differing from kutuzov and animated by different  alexander 
i was as necessary for the movement of the from 
east to west and for the of as kutuzov had 
been for the and glory of russia  kutuzov did 
not understand what europe the balance of power or napoleon 
meant he could not understand it for the of the 
russian people after the had been destroyed and russia had 
been and raised to the of her glory there was 
nothing left to do as a russian nothing remained for 
the of the war but to die and kutuzov died 
     chapter xii   as 
generally happens pierre did not feel the full of the 
and strain he had as until after they were over 
after his he reached and on the third day there 
when preparing to go to he fell ill and was 
laid up for three months he had what the doctors 
 but despite the fact that the doctors treated him 
him and gave him to drink he  scarcely any 
was left on pierre mind by all that happened to 
him from the time of his rescue till his illness 
he remembered only the dull gray weather now and now 
distress and in his feet and side he remembered a 
general of the and sufferings of people and of being 
by the curiosity of officers and who him he also 
remembered his difficulty in a and horses and above all 
he remembered his to think and feel all that time 
on the day of his rescue he had seen the 
body of petya rostov that same day he had learned 
that prince andrew after the battle of for more than 
a month had recently died in the rostovs house at 
and who told him this news also mentioned helene death 
that pierre had heard of it long before all this 
at the time seemed merely strange to pierre he felt 
he could not its just then he was only anxious 
to get away as quickly as possible from places where 
people were one another to some where he could himself 
rest and think over all the strange new he had 
learned but on reaching he immediately fell ill when he 
came to himself after his illness he saw in on 
him two of his and who had come from moscow 
and also his cousin the eldest princess who had been 
living on his at and hearing of his rescue and 
illness had come to look after him  it was 
only gradually during his that pierre lost the he had 
become accustomed to during the last few months and got 
used to the idea that no one would him to 
go anywhere tomorrow that no one would deprive him of 
his warm bed and that he would be sure to 
get his dinner tea and supper but for a long 
time in his he still saw himself in the of 
in the same way little by little he came to 
understand the news he had been told after his rescue 
about the death of prince andrew the death of his 
wife and the of the french  a joyous feeling 
of freedom complete freedom natural to man which he had 
first experienced at the first halt outside moscow pierre soul 
during his he was surprised to find that this inner 
freedom which was of now had as it were an 
setting of liberty he was alone in a strange town 
without no one demanded anything of him or sent him 
anywhere he had all he wanted the thought of his 
wife which had been a continual to him was no 
longer there since she was no more   how 
good how splendid said he to himself when a laid 
table was moved up to him with savory beef tea 
or when he lay down for the night on a 
soft clean bed or when he remembered that the french 
had gone and that his wife was no more  
how good how splendid  and by old habit he 
asked himself the question  and what then what am 
i going to do and he immediately gave himself the 
answer  i shall live ah how splendid  the 
very question that had tormented him the thing he had 
continually to find aim of life longer for him now 
that search for the aim of life had not merely 
felt that it no longer for him and could not 
present itself again and this very of an aim gave 
him the complete joyous sense of freedom which his happiness 
at this time  he could not see an aim 
for he now had faith faith in any kind of 
rule or words or ideas but faith in an ever 
ever god he had him in he set himself that 
search for an aim had been simply a search for 
god and suddenly in his he had learned not by 
words or but by direct feeling what his nurse had 
told him long ago that god is here and everywhere 
in his he had learned that in god was greater 
more and than in the of the recognized by the 
he felt like a man who after his eyes to 
see into the far distance finds what he at his 
very feet all his life he had looked over the 
heads of the men around him when he should have 
merely looked in front of him without his eyes  
in the past he had never been able to find 
that great something he had only felt that it must 
exist somewhere and had looked for it in everything near 
and he had only what was and he had himself 
with a mental and looked into space where hiding itself 
in distance had seemed to him great and merely because 
it was not clearly seen and such had life politics 
and seemed to him but even then at moments of 
weakness as he had them his mind had to those 
and he had there seen the same and now however 
he had learned to see the great and in everything 
and therefore see it and enjoy its naturally threw away 
the through which he had till now gazed over men 
heads and regarded the ever great and life around him 
and the closer he looked the more and happy he 
became that dreadful question  for which had destroyed all 
his mental no longer for him to that question  
for a simple answer was now always ready in his 
soul  there is a god that god without whose 
will not one hair from a man head   
   chapter xiii   in pierre had 
hardly changed at all in appearance he was just what 
he used to be as before he was absent and 
seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but 
with something special of his own the difference between his 
former and present self was that when he did not 
what lay before him or was said to him he 
had puckered his forehead as if to distinguish something at 
a distance at present he still forgot what was said 
to him and still did not see what was before 
his eyes but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible 
and smile at what was before him and listened to 
what was said though evidently seeing and hearing something quite 
different he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy 
man and so people had been inclined to avoid him 
now a smile at the joy of life always played 
round his lips and sympathy for others shone in his 
eyes with a look as to whether they were as 
as he was and people felt pleased by his presence 
 he had talked a great deal grew when he 
talked and listened now he was carried away in conversation 
and knew how to listen so that people told him 
their most intimate secrets  the princess who had never 
liked pierre and had been particularly to him since she 
had felt herself under to him after the old count 
death now after staying a short time in she had 
come intending to show pierre that in spite of his 
she considered it her duty to nurse him to her 
surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him 
pierre did not in any way her approval he merely 
studied her with interest she had felt that he regarded 
her with indifference and irony and so had into herself 
as she did with others and had shown him only 
the side of her nature but now he seemed to 
be trying to understand the most intimate places of her 
heart and at first but afterwards gratefully she let him 
see the kindly sides of her character  the most 
man could not have into her confidence more of the 
best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them 
yet pierre simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the 
human qualities of the embittered hard and  her own 
way proud princess   he is a very very 
kind man when he is not under the influence of 
bad people but of people such as myself thought she 
 his too and their own way noticed the change 
that had taken place in pierre they considered that he 
had become much  when he had helped him and 
wished him good night often lingered with his in his 
hands and clothes over his arm to see whether he 
would not start a talk and pierre noticing that wanted 
a generally kept him there   tell me now 
how did you get food he would ask  and 
would begin talking of the of moscow and of the 
old count and would stand for a long time holding 
the clothes and talking or sometimes listening to pierre stories 
and then would go out into the hall with a 
pleasant sense of with his and affection for him  
the doctor who attended pierre and him every day though 
he considered it his duty as a doctor to as 
a man whose every moment was of value to suffering 
would sit for hours with pierre telling him his favorite 
and his on the of his in general and especially 
of the ladies   a pleasure to talk to 
a man like that he is not like our he 
would say  there were several prisoners from the french 
army in and the doctor brought one of them a 
young italian to see pierre  this officer began visiting 
pierre and the princess used to make fun of the 
tenderness the italian expressed for him  the italian seemed 
happy only when he could come to see pierre talk 
with him tell him about his past his life at 
home and his love and out to him his against 
the french and especially against napoleon   all russians 
are in the least like you it is to fight 
such a nation he said to pierre  who have 
so from the french do not even feel toward them 
 pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian 
merely by the best side of his nature and taking 
a pleasure in so doing  during the last days 
of pierre stay in his old acquaintance count who had 
introduced him to the in  came to see him 
was married to a russian who had a large in 
and he occupied a post in the department in that 
town  hearing that bezukhov was in though they had 
never been intimate came to him with the of friendship 
and that people who meet in a desert generally express 
for one another felt dull in and was pleased to 
meet a man of his own circle and as he 
of interests  but to his surprise soon noticed that 
pierre had much behind the times and had as he 
expressed it to himself into and egotism   are 
letting yourself go my dear fellow he said  but 
for all that found it now than it had been 
to be with pierre and came to see him every 
day to pierre as he looked at and listened to 
it seemed strange to think that he had been like 
that himself but a short time before  was a 
married man with a family busy with his family affairs 
his wife affairs and his official duties he regarded all 
these as to life and considered that they were all 
because their aim was the welfare of himself and his 
family military political and interests continually his attention and pierre 
without trying to change the other views and without him 
but with the quiet joyful and amused smile now habitual 
to him was interested in this strange though very familiar 
 there was a new feature in pierre relations with 
with the princess with the doctor and with all the 
people he now met which gained for him the general 
good will this was his of the impossibility of changing 
a man by words and his of the of everyone 
thinking feeling and seeing things each from his own point 
of this peculiarity of each which used to and pierre 
now became a of the sympathy he felt for and 
the interest he took in other people the difference and 
sometimes complete between men opinions and their lives and between 
one man and another pleased him and drew from him 
an amused and gentle smile  in practical matters pierre 
unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had 
lacked all questions especially for money to which as an 
wealthy man he was very exposed produced in him a 
state of hopeless agitation and  give or not to 
give he had asked himself  have it and he 
it but someone else it still more who it most 
and perhaps they are both in the old days he 
had been unable to find a way out of all 
these surmises and had given to all who asked as 
long as he had anything to give he had been 
in a state of with regard to every question his 
property when one person one thing and another something else 
 now to his surprise he found that he no 
longer felt either doubt or about these questions there was 
now within him a judge who by some rule to 
him decided what should or should not be done  
he was as indifferent as to money matters but now 
he felt certain of what ought and what ought not 
to be done the first time he had to his 
new judge was when a french a colonel came to 
him and after talking a great deal about his concluded 
by making what to a demand that pierre should give 
him four thousand to send to his wife and children 
pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort and was 
afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used 
to appear so difficult at the same time that he 
refused the colonel demand he made up his mind that 
he must have to when leaving to the italian officer 
to accept some money of which he was evidently in 
need a further to pierre of his own more settled 
on practical matters was by his decision with regard to 
his wife and to the of his in and near 
moscow  his head came to him at and pierre 
up with him his income the burning of moscow had 
cost him to the head about two million rubles  
to console pierre for these the head gave him an 
showing that despite these his income would not be but 
would even be if he refused to pay his wife 
which he was under no obligation to meet and did 
not his moscow house and the country house on his 
moscow which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year 
and brought in nothing   of course that true 
said pierre with a cheerful smile  don need all 
that at all by being i have become much  
but in came from moscow and gave him an account 
of the state of things there and spoke of the 
an had made of the cost of the town and 
country speaking of this as of a settled matter about 
the same time he received from prince vasili and other 
petersburg speaking of his wife and pierre decided that the 
which had so pleased him were wrong and that he 
must go to petersburg and his wife affairs and must 
in moscow why this was necessary he did not know 
but he knew for certain that it was necessary his 
income would be by three but he felt it must 
be done  was going to moscow and they agreed 
to travel together  during the whole time of his 
in pierre had experienced a feeling of joy freedom and 
life but when during his he found himself in the 
open world and saw of new faces that feeling was 
his he felt like a on everyone the post the 
on the and in the a new for him the 
presence and remarks of who continually the and poverty of 
russia and its with europe only pierre pleasure where saw 
pierre saw an extraordinary strength and strength which in that 
space amid the the life of this peculiar and people 
he did not and even seemed to agree with him 
apparent being the simplest way to avoid that could lead 
to nothing he smiled joyfully as he listened to him 
     chapter xiv   it 
would be difficult to explain why and whose has been 
destroyed are hurrying some from the of and others back 
to the or why they one another and fight and 
it would be difficult to explain what the russians after 
the of the french to to the place that had 
been moscow but when we watch the round their the 
energy and immense number of the insects prove that despite 
the of the something which though is the real strength 
of the still and though in moscow in the month 
of there was no government and no or was still 
the moscow it had been in august all was destroyed 
except something yet powerful and  the of those who 
from all sides to moscow after it had been of 
the were most and and at first for the most 
part and one motive only they all had in common 
a desire to get to the place that had been 
called moscow to apply their there  within a week 
moscow already had fifteen thousand in a twenty thousand and 
so on by the of  the number ever and 
what it had been in   the first russians 
to enter moscow were the of wintzingerode from the and 
who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in 
its the russians who entered moscow finding it it in 
their turn they continued what the french had of came 
to moscow to carry off to the what had been 
in the and the the carried off what they could 
to their and the seized all they could find in 
other and moved it to their own that it was 
their property  but the first were followed by a 
second and a third and with became more and more 
difficult and assumed more definite  the french found moscow 
but with all the of regular life with branches of 
and with and and these were lifeless but still there 
were the most part still with there were and and 
wealthy filled with government and the longer the french remained 
the more these of town life perished until finally all 
was into one confused lifeless scene of  the more 
the by the french continued the more both the wealth 
of moscow and the strength of its was destroyed but 
by the russians with which the of the city began 
had an opposite effect the longer it continued and the 
greater the number of people taking part in it the 
more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its 
regular life restored  besides the very people some drawn 
by curiosity some by official duties some by self of 
all kinds and into moscow as blood to the heart 
 within a week the who came with empty to 
carry off were stopped by the and made to the 
out of the town other having heard of their comrades 
came to town bringing and and beat down one another 
to below what they had been in former days of 
for high pay arrived in moscow every day and on 
all sides were being new built and old ones began 
in and were opened in the resumed the in many 
that had not been property that had been government set 
up their tables and their of in small rooms the 
higher and the police the of left behind by the 
french the of in which much property had been left 
brought there from other of the of taking everything to 
the in the others that as the french had gathered 
things from different into this or that house it would 
be to allow its to keep all that was found 
there they the police and them made out at ten 
times their value for government that had perished in the 
fire and demanded relief and count wrote    
  chapter xv   at the end of 
pierre went to moscow and stayed in an of his 
house which had not been he called on count and 
on some who were back in moscow and he intended 
to leave for petersburg two days later everybody was the 
everything was with life in the but city everyone was 
pleased to see pierre everyone wished to meet him and 
everyone him about what he had seen pierre felt particularly 
well disposed toward them all but was now on his 
for fear of himself in any way to all questions 
put to him important or quite as where would he 
live was he going to when was he going to 
petersburg and would he mind taking a for someone replied 
 perhaps or  think so and so on  
he had heard that the rostovs were at but the 
thought of natasha occurred to him if it did it 
was only as a pleasant memory of the past he 
felt himself not only free from social but also from 
that feeling which it seemed to him he had in 
himself  on the third day after his arrival he 
heard from the that princess mary was in moscow the 
death sufferings and last days of prince andrew had often 
occupied pierre thoughts and now to him with fresh having 
heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and 
living in her house had not been street he drove 
that same evening to see her  on his way 
to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew of 
their friendship of his with him and especially of the 
last one at   it possible that he died 
in the frame of mind he was then in is 
it possible that the meaning of life was not to 
him before he died thought pierre he recalled and his 
death and began to compare these two men so different 
and yet so in that they had both lived and 
both died and in the love he felt for both 
of them  pierre drove up to the house of 
the old prince in a most serious mood the house 
had the fire it showed signs of but its general 
was the old footman who met pierre with a stern 
face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that 
the of the old prince had not disturbed the order 
of things in the house him that the princess had 
gone to her own apartments and that she received on 
  me perhaps she will see me said pierre 
  sir said the man  step into the 
portrait gallery  a few minutes later the footman returned 
with who brought word from the princess that she would 
be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse 
her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her  
in a rather low room lit by one sat the 
princess and with her another person dressed in black pierre 
remembered that the princess always had lady but who they 
were and what they were like he never knew or 
remembered  must be one of her he thought glancing 
at the lady in the black dress  the princess 
rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand 
  she said looking at his altered face after 
he had kissed her hand  this is how we 
meet again he spoke of you even at the very 
last she went on turning her eyes from pierre to 
her companion with a that surprised him for an instant 
  was so glad to hear of your safety 
it was the first piece of good news we had 
received for a long time  again the princess glanced 
round at her companion with even more in her manner 
and was about to add something but pierre interrupted her 
  imagine knew nothing about him said he  
thought he had been killed all i know i heard 
at second hand from others i only know that he 
fell in with the rostovs what a strange  pierre 
spoke rapidly and with animation he glanced once at the 
companion face saw her attentive and kindly fixed on him 
and as often happens when one is talking felt somehow 
that this companion in the black dress was a good 
kind excellent creature who would not his conversing with princess 
mary  but when he mentioned the rostovs princess mary 
face expressed still greater embarrassment she again glanced rapidly from 
pierre face to that of the lady in the black 
dress and said   you really not recognize her 
 pierre looked again at the companion pale delicate face 
with its black eyes and peculiar mouth and something near 
to him long forgotten and more than sweet looked at 
him from those attentive eyes   no it can 
be he thought  stern thin pale face that looks 
so much older it cannot be she it merely me 
of her but at that moment princess mary said  
and with difficulty effort and like the opening of a 
door grown on its a smile appeared on the face 
with the attentive eyes and from that opening door came 
a of which pierre with a happiness he had long 
forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking 
at that moment it him seized him and him completely 
when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was 
natasha and he loved her  at that moment pierre 
to her to princess mary and above all to himself 
a secret of which he himself had been unaware he 
flushed joyfully yet with painful distress he tried to hide 
his agitation but the more he tried to hide it 
the more clearly than any words could have done he 
to himself to her and to princess mary that he 
loved her   it only the of it thought 
pierre but as soon as he tried to continue the 
conversation he had with princess mary he again glanced at 
natasha and a still his face and a still agitation 
of mingled joy and fear seized his soul he became 
confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of 
what he was saying  pierre had failed to notice 
natasha because he did not at all expect to see 
her there but he had failed to recognize her because 
the change in her since he last saw her was 
immense she had grown thin and pale but that was 
not what made her she was at the moment he 
entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone 
with a suppressed smile of the joy of life now 
when he first entered and glanced at her there was 
not the least of a smile only her eyes were 
kindly attentive and sadly  pierre was not reflected by 
any on natasha part but only by the pleasure that 
just perceptibly lit up her whole face    
  chapter xvi    has come to 
stay with me said princess mary  count and countess 
will be here in a few days the countess is 
in a dreadful state but it was necessary for natasha 
herself to see a doctor they on her coming with 
me   is there a family free from sorrow 
now said pierre addressing natasha  know it happened the 
very day we were i saw him what a delightful 
boy he was  natasha looked at him and by 
way of answer to his words her eyes widened and 
lit up   can one say or think of 
as a said pierre  why had such a splendid 
boy so full of life to die   in 
these days it would be hard to live without faith 
remarked princess mary   yes that is really true 
pierre hastily interrupted her   is it true natasha 
asked looking attentively into pierre eyes   can you 
ask why said princess mary  thought alone of what 
 natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again 
looked inquiringly at pierre   because pierre continued  
one who that there is a god us can bear 
a such as hers and yours  natasha had already 
opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped pierre hurriedly 
turned away from her and again addressed princess mary asking 
about his friend last days  pierre had now almost 
vanished but at the same time he felt that his 
freedom had also completely gone he felt that there was 
now a judge of his every word and whose more 
to him than that of all the rest of the 
world as he spoke now he was considering what his 
words would make on natasha he did not say things 
to please her but he was saying he regarded from 
her  princess mary as is usual in such telling 
of the condition in which she had found prince andrew 
but pierre face quivering with his questions and his eager 
expression gradually compelled her to go into which she feared 
to for her own sake   yes and so 
pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his 
whole body and eagerly listened to her story  yes 
so he grew and with all his soul he had 
always one thing be perfectly good he could not be 
afraid of death the he had he had any not 
of his making so he did what a happy thing 
that he saw you again he added suddenly turning to 
natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears 
 natasha face she frowned and lowered her eyes for 
a moment she for an instant whether to speak or 
not   that was happiness she then said in 
her quiet voice with its deep chest notes  me 
it certainly was happiness she paused  he he he 
said he was wishing for it at the very moment 
i entered the room  natasha voice broke she blushed 
pressed her clasped hands on her knees and then herself 
with an evident effort lifted her head and began to 
speak rapidly   knew nothing of it when we 
started from moscow i did not to ask about him 
then suddenly sonya told me he was with us i 
had no idea and could not imagine what state he 
was in all i wanted was to see him and 
be with him she said and breathing quickly  and 
not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell 
what she had never yet mentioned to anyone she had 
lived through during those three of their and life at 
 pierre listened to her with lips and eyes fixed 
upon her full of tears as he listened he did 
not think of prince andrew nor of death nor of 
what she was telling he listened to her and felt 
only pity for her for what she was suffering now 
while she was speaking  princess mary frowning in her 
effort to hold back her tears sat beside natasha and 
heard for the first time the story of those last 
days of her brother and natasha love  evidently natasha 
to tell that painful yet joyful tale  she spoke 
mingling most with the intimate secrets of her soul and 
it seemed as if she could never finish several times 
she repeated the same thing twice  voice was heard 
outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in 
to say good night   that all said natasha 
 she got up quickly just as nicholas entered almost 
ran to the door which was by struck her head 
against it and rushed from the room with a either 
of or sorrow  pierre gazed at the door through 
which she had and did not understand why he suddenly 
felt all alone in the world  princess mary roused 
him from his by drawing his attention to her who 
had entered the room  at that moment of tenderness 
young nicholas face which his father affected pierre so much 
that when he had kissed the boy he got up 
quickly took out his handkerchief and went to the window 
he wished to take leave of princess mary but she 
would not let him go   natasha and i 
sometimes don go to sleep till after two so please 
don go i will order supper go downstairs we will 
come immediately  before pierre left the room princess mary 
told him  is the first time she has talked 
of him like that      chapter 
xvii   pierre was shown into the large lit 
dining room a few minutes later he heard footsteps and 
princess mary entered with natasha natasha was calm though a 
severe and grave expression had again settled on her face 
they all three of them now experienced that feeling of 
awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and talk it 
is impossible to go back to the same conversation to 
talk of trifles is awkward and yet the desire to 
speak is there and silence seems like affectation they went 
silently to table the footmen drew back the chairs and 
pushed them up again pierre his cold table napkin and 
to break the silence looked at natasha and at princess 
mary they had evidently both formed the same resolution the 
eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a that besides 
sorrow life also has joy   you take count 
asked princess mary and those words suddenly the of the 
past  tell us about yourself said she  such 
about you   replied pierre with the smile of 
irony now habitual to him  even tell me i 
myself never of mary me to her house and kept 
telling me what had happened or ought to have happened 
to me also me how i ought to tell of 
my in general i have noticed that it is very 
easy to be an interesting man  am an interesting 
man now people invite me out and tell me all 
about myself  natasha smiled and was on the point 
of speaking   have been told princess mary interrupted 
her  you lost two millions in moscow is that 
true   i am three times as rich as 
before returned pierre  though the position was now altered 
by his decision to pay his wife and to his 
pierre still that he had become three times as rich 
as before   i have certainly gained is freedom 
he began seriously but did not continue noticing that this 
was too   are you building   says 
i must   me you did not know of 
the countess death when you decided to remain in moscow 
asked princess mary and immediately blushed noticing that her question 
following his mention of freedom to his words a meaning 
he had perhaps not intended   answered pierre evidently 
not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to 
his words  heard of it in and you cannot 
imagine how it me we were not an he added 
quickly glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity 
as to how he would speak of his wife  
her death me when two people they are always both 
in and one own suddenly serious when the other is 
no longer and then such a death without friends and 
without i am very very sorry for her he concluded 
and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval 
on natasha face   and so you are once 
more an bachelor said princess mary  pierre suddenly flushed 
crimson and for a long time tried not to look 
at natasha when he to glance her way again her 
face was cold stern and he even   did 
you really see and speak to napoleon as we have 
been told said princess mary  pierre laughed   
not once everybody seems to imagine that being taken means 
being napoleon not only did i never see him but 
i heard nothing about him was in much lower company 
 supper was over and pierre who at first declined 
to speak about his was gradually led on to do 
so   it true that you remained in moscow 
to kill napoleon natasha asked with a slight smile  
guessed it then when we met at the do you 
remember  pierre that it was true and from that 
was gradually led by princess mary questions and especially by 
natasha into giving a account of his  at first 
he spoke with the amused and irony now with him 
toward everybody and especially toward himself but when he came 
to describe the horrors and sufferings he had he was 
carried away and began speaking with the suppressed of a 
man in strong he has lived through  princess mary 
with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now 
at natasha in the whole she saw only pierre and 
his goodness natasha on her elbow the expression of her 
face constantly changing with the watched pierre with an attention 
that never herself experiencing all that he described not only 
her look but her and the questions she put showed 
pierre that she understood just what he wished to it 
was clear that she understood not only what he said 
but also what he wished to but could not express 
in words the account pierre gave of the with the 
child and the woman for whom he was was this 
 was an awful sight some in the one was 
out before my eyes and there were women who had 
their things off and their earrings out he flushed and 
grew confused  a arrived and all the men those 
who were not that is and i among them  
 am sure you not telling us everything i am 
sure you did something said natasha and added  fine 
 pierre continued when he spoke of the execution he 
wanted to pass over the horrible but natasha that he 
should not anything  pierre began to tell about but 
paused by this time he had from the table and 
was pacing the room natasha following him with her eyes 
then he added   you can understand what i 
learned from that man simple fellow   yes go 
on said natasha  is he   killed him 
almost before my eyes  and pierre his voice continually 
went on to tell of the last days of their 
of illness and his death  he told of his 
as he had never yet recalled them he now as 
it were saw a new meaning in all he had 
gone through now that he was telling it all to 
natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when 
women listen to him clever women who when listening either 
try to remember what they hear to their minds and 
when opportunity to it or who wish to it to 
some thought of their own and their own clever prepared 
in their little mental the pleasure given by real women 
with a capacity to and the very best a man 
shows of himself natasha without knowing it was all attention 
she did not lose a word no single in pierre 
voice no look no of a muscle in his face 
nor a single gesture she caught the word in its 
flight and took it straight into her open heart the 
secret meaning of all pierre mental  princess mary understood 
his story and with him but she now saw something 
else that all her attention she saw the of love 
and happiness between natasha and pierre and the first thought 
of this filled her heart with  it was three 
o in the morning the footmen came in with sad 
and stern faces to change the candles but no one 
noticed them  pierre finished his story natasha continued to 
look at him with bright attentive and animated eyes as 
if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps 
left pierre in and happy glanced occasionally at her and 
tried to think what to say next to introduce a 
fresh subject princess mary was silent it occurred to none 
of them that it was three o and time to 
go to bed   speak of and sufferings remarked 
pierre  if at this moment i were asked  
you rather be what you were before you were taken 
or go through all this again then for heaven sake 
let me again have and we imagine that when we 
are thrown out of our usual all is lost but 
it is only then that what is new and good 
while there is life there is happiness there is much 
much before us i say this to you he added 
turning to natasha   yes she said answering something 
quite different  too should wish nothing but to it 
all from the beginning  pierre looked at her  
 and nothing more said natasha   not true 
not true cried pierre  am not to for being 
and wishing to live you either  suddenly natasha bent 
her head covered her face with her hands and began 
to cry   is it natasha said princess mary 
  nothing she smiled at pierre through her tears 
 night it is time for bed  pierre rose 
and took his leave   princess mary and natasha 
met as usual in the they talked of what pierre 
had told them princess mary did not express her opinion 
of pierre nor did natasha speak of him   
good night mary said natasha  you know i am 
often afraid that by not speaking of him  meant 
prince andrew  fear of not doing to our we 
forget him  princess mary deeply and the of natasha 
remark but she did not express in words   
it possible to forget said she   did me 
so much good to tell all about it today it 
was hard and painful but good very good said natasha 
 am sure he really loved him that is why 
i told him was it all right she added suddenly 
blushing   tell pierre oh yes what a splendid 
man he is said princess mary   you know 
mary natasha suddenly said with a smile such as princess 
mary had not seen on her face for a long 
time  has somehow grown so clean and fresh if 
he had just come out of a russian do you 
understand out of a isn it true   replied 
princess mary  has greatly   a short coat 
and his hair just as if well just as if 
he had come straight from the papa used to  
 understand why he  andrew  no one so 
much as him said princess mary   and yet 
he is quite different they say men are friends when 
they are quite different that must be true really he 
is quite unlike him everything   but he wonderful 
  good night said natasha  and the same 
smile lingered for a long time on her face as 
if it had been forgotten there     
 chapter xviii   it was a long time 
before pierre could fall that night he up and down 
his room now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem 
and frowning now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and and now 
smiling  he was thinking of prince andrew of natasha 
and of their love at one moment of her past 
then himself for that feeling it was already six in 
the morning and he still up and down the room 
  what to be done if it cannot be 
what to be done evidently it has to be so 
said he to himself and hastily he got into bed 
happy and agitated but free from or   and 
impossible as such happiness seems i must do everything that 
she and i may be man and wife he told 
himself  a few days pierre had decided to go 
to petersburg on the when he on the thursday came 
to ask him about for the   to petersburg 
what is petersburg who is there in petersburg he asked 
though only to himself  yes long ago before this 
happened i did for some reason mean to go to 
petersburg he reflected  but perhaps i shall go what 
a good fellow he is and how attentive and how 
he everything he thought looking at old face  what 
a pleasant smile he has   do you still 
not wish to accept your freedom pierre asked him  
 the good of freedom to me your excellency we 
lived under the late count of heaven be his we 
have lived under you too without ever being   
your children   children will live just the same 
with such one can live   what about my 
said pierre  i suddenly marry it might happen he 
added with an involuntary smile   i may take 
the liberty your excellency it would be a good thing 
  easy he thinks it thought pierre  doesn 
know how terrible it is and how dangerous too soon 
or too late it is terrible   what are 
your orders are you starting tomorrow asked   i 
put it off for a bit i tell you later 
you must forgive the trouble i have put you to 
said pierre and seeing smile he thought  how strange 
it is that he should not know that now there 
is no petersburg for me and that that must be 
settled first of all but probably he knows it well 
enough and is only shall i have a talk with 
him and see what he thinks pierre reflected  another 
time  at pierre told the princess his cousin that 
he had been to see princess mary the day before 
and had there met do you think natasha rostova  
the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that 
than if he had seen anna   you know 
her asked pierre   have seen the princess she 
replied  heard that they were arranging a match for 
her with young rostov it would be a very good 
thing for the rostovs they are said to be  
 i mean do you know natasha rostova   
heard about that affair of hers at the time it 
was a great pity   she either doesn understand 
or is thought pierre  not say anything to her 
either  the princess too had prepared for pierre  
 kind they all are thought pierre  is surprising 
is that they should trouble about these things now when 
it can no longer be of interest to them and 
all for me  on the same day the chief 
of police came to pierre inviting him to send a 
to the to things that were to be returned to 
their that day   this man too thought pierre 
looking into the face of the chief of police  
a fine good officer and how kind fancy about such 
trifles now and they say he is not and takes 
what nonsense besides why he take that the way he 
was brought up and everybody does it but what a 
kind pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks 
at me  pierre went to princess mary to dinner 
 as he drove through the past the that had 
been down he was surprised by the beauty of those 
the of the and of the of the town out 
and concealing one another reminded him of the and the 
the he met and their the the for new with 
the women and the all looked at him with cheerful 
beaming eyes that seemed to say  there he is 
let see what will come of it  at the 
entrance to princess mary house pierre felt doubtful whether he 
had really been there the night before and really seen 
natasha and talked to her  i imagined it perhaps 
i shall go in and find no one there but 
he had hardly entered the room before he felt her 
presence with his whole being by the of his sense 
of freedom she was in the same black dress with 
soft folds and her hair was done the same way 
as the day before yet she was quite different had 
she been like this when he entered the day before 
he could not for a moment have failed to recognize 
her  she was as he had known her almost 
as a child and later on as prince andrew a 
bright light shone in her eyes and on her face 
was a friendly and expression  pierre with them and 
would have spent the whole evening there but princess mary 
was going to and pierre left the house with her 
 next day he came early and stayed the whole 
evening though princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to 
see their visitor and though all pierre interest was now 
in that house by the evening they had talked over 
everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to 
another and broke off he stayed so long that princess 
mary and natasha exchanged glances evidently wondering when he would 
go pierre noticed this but could not go he felt 
uneasy and but sat on because he simply could not 
get up and take his leave  princess mary no 
end to this rose first and of a began to 
say good night   you are going to petersburg 
tomorrow she asked   i am not going pierre 
replied hastily in a surprised tone and as though offended 
 no to petersburg tomorrow i won say good yet 
i will call round in case you have any for 
me said he standing before princess mary and turning red 
but not taking his  natasha gave him her hand 
and went out princess mary on the other hand instead 
of going away into an armchair and looked sternly and 
at him with her deep radiant eyes the weariness she 
had plainly shown before had now quite passed off with 
a deep and long sigh she seemed to be prepared 
for a talk  when natasha left the room pierre 
and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement 
he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary   
i wanted to tell you said he answering her look 
as if she had spoken  help me what am 
i to do can i hope princess my dear friend 
listen i know it all i know i am not 
worthy of her i know it impossible to speak of 
it now but i want to be a brother to 
her no not that i don i can  he 
paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands 
  he went on with an evident effort at 
self and  don know when i began to love 
her but i have loved her and her alone all 
my life and i love her so that i cannot 
imagine life without her i cannot to her at present 
but the thought that perhaps she might be my wife 
and that i may be missing that that is terrible 
tell me can i hope tell me what i am 
to do dear princess he added after a pause and 
touched her hand as she did not reply   
am thinking of what you have told me answered princess 
mary  is what i will say you are right 
that to speak to her of love at present  
princess mary stopped she was going to say that to 
speak of love was impossible but she stopped because she 
had seen by the change in natasha two days before 
that she would not only not be hurt if pierre 
spoke of his love but that it was the very 
thing she wished for   speak to her now 
do said the princess all the same   what 
am i to do   it to me said 
princess mary  know  pierre was looking into princess 
mary eyes   well he said   know 
that she will love you princess mary herself  before 
her words were out pierre had sprung up and with 
a frightened expression seized princess mary hand   makes 
you think so you think i may hope you think 
  i think so said princess mary with a 
smile  to her parents and leave it to me 
i will tell her when i can i wish it 
to happen and my heart tells me it will  
 it cannot be how happy i am but it 
can be how happy i am no it can be 
pierre kept saying as he kissed princess mary hands  
 to petersburg that will be best and i will 
write to you she said   petersburg go there 
very well i go but i may come again tomorrow 
 next day pierre came to say good natasha was 
less animated than she had been the day before but 
that day as he looked at her pierre sometimes felt 
as if he was and that neither he nor she 
any longer that nothing but happiness  it possible no 
it can be he told himself at every look gesture 
and word that filled his soul with joy  when 
on saying good he took her thin slender hand he 
could not help holding it a little longer in his 
own   it possible that this hand that face 
those eyes all this treasure of feminine so strange to 
me now is it possible that it will one day 
be mine forever as familiar to me as i am 
to myself no that impossible   count she said 
aloud  shall look forward very much to your return 
she added in a whisper  and these simple words 
her look and the expression on her face which accompanied 
them formed for two months the subject of and happy 
for pierre  shall look forward very much to your 
return yes yes how did she say it yes  
shall look forward very much to your return oh how 
happy i am what is to me how happy i 
am said pierre to himself      
chapter xix   there was nothing in pierre soul 
now at all like what had it during his of 
helene  he did not to himself with a feeling 
of shame the words he had spoken or say  
why did i not say that and  made me 
say  vous on the contrary he now repeated in 
every word that he or natasha had spoken and every 
of her face and smile and did not wish to 
diminish or add anything but only to it again and 
again there was now not a of doubt in his 
mind as to whether what he had was right or 
wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes his mind  it 
all a isn princess mary mistaken am i not too 
and self i believe all this suddenly princess mary will 
tell her and she will be sure to smile and 
say  strange he must be himself doesn he know 
that he is a man just a man while i 
i am something different and higher  that was the 
only doubt often pierre he did not now make any 
the happiness before him appeared so that if only he 
could it it would be the end of all things 
everything ended with that  a joyful of which he 
had thought himself incapable possessed him the whole meaning of 
life for him alone but for the whole world to 
him in his love and the of being loved by 
her at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied 
with one thing only future happiness sometimes it seemed to 
him that other people were all as pleased as he 
was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by 
to be busy with other interests in every word and 
gesture he saw to his happiness he often surprised those 
he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which 
seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them 
and when he realized that people might not be aware 
of his happiness he pitied them with his whole heart 
and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that 
all that occupied them was a mere of attention  
when it was suggested to him that he should enter 
the civil service or when the war or any general 
political affairs were discussed on the that everybody welfare on 
this or that of he would listen with a and 
smile and surprise people by his strange but at this 
time he saw everybody those who as he imagined understood 
the real meaning of life  is what he was 
feeling and those who evidently did not understand it the 
bright light of the that shone within himself and at 
once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything 
that was good and worthy of being loved  when 
with the affairs and papers of his dead wife her 
memory in him no feeling but pity that she had 
not known the he now knew prince vasili who having 
obtained a new post and some fresh was particularly proud 
at this time seemed to him a pathetic kindly old 
man much to be pitied  often in pierre recalled 
this period of all the views he formed of men 
and circumstances at this time remained true for him always 
he not only did not them subsequently but when he 
was in doubt or at he to the views he 
had held at this time of his and they always 
correct   may have appeared strange and queer then 
he thought  i was not so mad as i 
seemed on the contrary i was then and had more 
than at any other time and understood all that is 
worth understanding in life because because i was happy  
pierre in not waiting as he used to do to 
which he  qualities in people before them his heart 
was now with love and by people without cause he 
discovered causes for them      chapter 
xx   after pierre that first evening when natasha 
had said to princess mary with a gaily smile  
looks just yes just as if he had come out 
of a russian a short coat and with his hair 
something and to herself but in natasha soul  everything 
her face walk look and voice was suddenly altered to 
her own surprise a power of life and hope of 
happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction from that 
evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened 
to her she no longer of her position did not 
say a word about the past and no longer feared 
to make happy for the future she spoke little of 
pierre but when princess mary mentioned him a long light 
once more in her eyes and her lips curved with 
a strange smile  the change that took place in 
natasha at first surprised princess mary but when she understood 
its meaning it her  she have loved my brother 
so little as to be able to forget him so 
soon she thought when she reflected on the change but 
when she was with natasha she was not vexed with 
her and did not reproach her the power of life 
that had seized natasha was so evidently and by her 
that in her presence princess mary felt that she had 
no right to reproach her even in her heart  
 natasha gave herself up so fully and to this 
new feeling that she did not try to hide the 
fact that she was no longer sad but bright and 
cheerful  when princess mary returned to her room after 
her talk with pierre natasha met her on the  
 has spoken yes he has spoken she repeated  
and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg 
forgiveness for her joy settled on natasha face   
wanted to listen at the door but i knew you 
would tell me  and touching as the look with 
which natasha gazed at her seemed to princess mary and 
sorry as she was to see her agitation these words 
her for a moment she remembered her brother and his 
love   what to be done she can help 
it thought the princess  and with a sad and 
rather stern look she told natasha all that pierre had 
said on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha 
was   petersburg she repeated as if unable to 
understand  but noticing the expression on princess mary face 
she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began 
to cry   said she  me what i 
should do i am afraid of being bad you tell 
me i will do tell me   love him 
  whispered natasha   why are you crying 
i am happy for your sake said princess mary who 
because of those tears quite natasha joy   won 
be just yet think what fun it will be when 
i am his wife and you marry nicholas   
i have asked you not to speak of that let 
us talk about you  they were silent   
why go to petersburg natasha suddenly asked and hastily replied 
to her own question  no no he must yes 
mary he must      first  
       chapter i  
 seven years had passed the sea of history had 
within its and seemed to have become calm but the 
forces that move  because the of their motion are 
to us continued to  though the surface of the 
sea of history seemed the movement of went on as 
as the flow of time groups of people formed and 
the coming and of and of was in course of 
 the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from 
to as it was in its were not by the 
waves from one to another as before they now seemed 
to on one spot the at the head of who 
reflected the movement of the by wars and now reflected 
the movement by political and and  the call this 
of the   in with this period they sternly 
the who in their opinion what they describe as the 
all the well people of that period from alexander and 
napoleon to madame de and the rest pass before their 
stern seat and are or to whether they to progress 
or to  to their accounts a took place at 
that time in russia also and the chief was alexander 
i the same man who to them was the chief 
cause of the movement at the of his being the 
of russia  there is no one in russian now 
from to learned who does not throw his little stone 
at alexander for things he did wrong at this period 
of his   ought to have acted in this 
way and in that way in this case he did 
well and in that case badly he behaved at the 
beginning of his and during  but acted badly by 
giving a to the alliance power to golitsyn and and 
afterwards and he also acted badly by himself with the 
active army and the semenov regiment  it would take 
a to all the the to him on their knowledge 
of what is good for  what do these mean 
 do not the very actions for which the praise 
alexander i  at the beginning of his his with 
napoleon the he in  and the of  flow 
from the same circumstances of his education and life made 
his what it was and from which the actions for 
which they him  alliance the of and the of 
 and later also  in what does the of 
those lie  it lies in the fact that an 
character like alexander i standing on the highest possible of 
human power with the light of history upon him a 
character exposed to those of all the intrigues and self 
from power a character who at every moment of his 
life felt a responsibility for all that was in europe 
and not a but a live character who like every 
man had his and toward goodness beauty and truth this 
character not in  do not him of that not 
the same of the welfare of fifty years ago as 
a present who from his youth has been occupied with 
learning that is with and and with taking notes from 
them  but even if we that fifty years ago 
alexander i was mistaken in his of what was good 
for the people we must that the who alexander will 
also after the of some time turn out to be 
mistaken in his of what is good for this is 
all the more natural and because watching the movement of 
history we see that every year and with each new 
opinion as to what is good for mankind so that 
what once seemed good ten years later seems bad and 
and what is more we find at one and the 
same time quite views as to what is bad and 
what is good in history some people regard giving a 
to and the alliance as in alexander while others regard 
it as  the of alexander or of napoleon cannot 
be called or for it is impossible to say for 
what it was or if that somebody this is only 
because it does not agree with his understanding of what 
is good whether the of my father house in moscow 
or the glory of the russian arms or the of 
the petersburg and other or the freedom of or the 
greatness of russia or the balance of power in europe 
or a certain kind of culture called  appear to 
me to be good or bad i must admit that 
besides these things the of every character has other more 
general to me  but let us that what is 
called science can all and an unchanging of good and 
bad by which to try and let us say that 
alexander could have done everything differently let us say that 
with from those who him and who to know the 
aim of the movement of he might have arranged matters 
to the program his present would have given him freedom 
equality and progress  i think the ground let us 
that this program was possible and had then been and 
that alexander had acted on it what would then have 
become of the of all those who the that then 
in the government that in the opinion of the was 
good and their would not have there would have been 
no life there would have been nothing  if we 
admit that human life can be by reason the of 
life is destroyed      chapter ii 
  if we as the do that great men 
lead to the attainment of certain greatness of russia or 
of france the balance of power in europe the of 
the ideas of the revolution general progress or anything else 
it is impossible to explain the of history without the 
of and  if the aim of the wars at 
the beginning of the century had been the of russia 
that aim might have been accomplished without all the wars 
and without the if the aim was the of france 
that might have been without the revolution and without the 
empire if the aim was the of ideas the press 
could have accomplished that much better than if the aim 
was the progress of it is easy to see that 
there are other of more than by the of wealth 
and of human lives  why did it happen in 
this and not in some other way  because it 
happened so  the situation it says history  but 
what is what is  the words and do not 
any really thing and therefore cannot be those words only 
a certain of understanding of i do not know why 
a certain i think that i cannot know it so 
i do not try to know it and i talk 
about i see a force the of ordinary human i 
do not understand why this and i talk of  
to a of the the each evening into a special 
to and that twice as fat as the others must 
seem to be a and it must appear an astonishing 
of with a whole of extraordinary that this who instead 
of getting into the general every evening goes into a 
special where there are this very with fat is killed 
for meat  but the need only to suppose that 
all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment 
of their they need only admit that what happens to 
them may also have their and they will at once 
a and in what happened to the that was even 
if they do not know for what purpose they are 
they will at least know that all that happened to 
the did not happen and will no longer need the 
of or  only by our to a purpose immediately 
to us and admitting the purpose to be our may 
we the of in the lives of and the cause 
of the effect they produce  with ordinary human and 
then the words and become  we need only confess 
that we do not know the purpose of the and 
that we know only the is the first in france 
then in in africa in prussia in austria in and 
in russia that the movements from the west to the 
east and from the east to the west form the 
and purpose of these and not only shall we have 
no need to see exceptional ability and in napoleon and 
alexander but we shall be unable to consider them to 
be anything but like other men and we shall not 
be to have to for an of those small which 
made these people what they were but it will be 
clear that all those small were  by a to 
knowledge of the purpose we shall clearly that just as 
one cannot imagine a or for any single plant better 
to it than those it so it is impossible to 
imagine any two people more completely down to the for 
the purpose they had to fulfill than napoleon and alexander 
with all their      chapter iii 
  the and essential of the of the beginning 
of the century lies in the movement of the of 
the from west to east and afterwards from east to 
west the of that movement was the movement from west 
to east for the of the west to be able 
to make their movement to moscow it was necessary  
that they should form themselves into a military group of 
a size able to endure a with the military group 
of the east  that they should all and and 
 that during their military movement they should have at 
their head a man who could justify to himself and 
to them the and which would have to be committed 
during that movement  and beginning with the french revolution 
the old large group was destroyed as well as the 
old and and step by step a group was formed 
of larger with new and and a man was produced 
who would stand at the head of the coming movement 
and bear the responsibility for all that had to be 
done  a man without without without without a name 
and not even a frenchman what seem the among all 
the french parties and without joining any one of them 
is forward to a prominent position  the of his 
the weakness and of his the of his and the 
and self of this man him to the head of 
the army the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the 
army sent to his to fight and his own childish 
and self secure him military so called him everywhere the 
into which he with the of france to his his 
to avoid his path are he is not received into 
the russian service and the appointment he seeks in comes 
to nothing during the war in he is several times 
on the of and each time is in an manner 
to the russian those which might have destroyed his not 
appear upon the scene till he is no longer there 
 on his return from he finds the government in 
paris in a process of in which all those who 
are in it are out and destroyed and by an 
escape from this dangerous position itself in the form of 
an and expedition to africa again so him malta without 
a his most reckless are with success the which subsequently 
did not let a single boat pass his army to 
it in africa a whole of are committed against the 
almost and the men who commit these especially their assure 
themselves that this is this is glory caesar and alexander 
the great and is therefore good  this of glory 
and not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does 
but in on every one to it an to this 
man and his had for its in africa he does 
the plague does not touch him the of prisoners is 
not to him as a his and from africa leaving 
his comrades in distress is set down to his and 
again the twice him slip past when by the he 
has committed so he paris the of the government which 
a year earlier might have him has reached its extreme 
and his presence there now as a free from party 
can only serve to him though he himself has no 
plan he is quite ready for his new role  
he had no plan he was afraid of everything but 
the parties at him and demanded his  he alone 
his of glory and developed in and his self his 
boldness in and in lying alone could justify what had 
to be done  he is for the place that 
him and so almost apart from his will and despite 
his his lack of a plan and all his he 
is drawn into a that at power and the is 
with success  he is pushed into a meeting of 
the in alarm he wishes to considering himself lost he 
to fall into a and says things that should have 
him but the once proud and of france feeling that 
their part is played out are even more than he 
and do not say the words they should have said 
to him and their power  millions of give him 
power and all men as if by to that power 
the of the of france who to him the character 
of i of russia who recognizes his government a against 
him which not only to him but his power the 
duc d in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to 
kill him the more than in any other way that 
he had the right since he had the might that 
though he all his to prepare an expedition against england 
 would have him he never out that intention but 
unexpectedly upon and the who without a battle and give 
him the at and by all men not only the 
french but all europe england which does not take part 
in the about to happen their former horror and of 
his now recognize his the he has given himself and 
his of and glory which seems excellent and to them 
all  as if themselves and preparing for the coming 
movement the forces toward the east several times in  
  and  gaining strength and growing in  
the group of people that had formed in france into 
one group with the of europe the strength of the 
of the man who at the head of the movement 
with the size of the group during the ten period 
this man had formed relations with all the heads of 
europe the discredited of the world can no to the 
of glory and one after another they to display their 
before him the king of prussia his wife to the 
great man mercy the emperor of austria considers it a 
favor that this man a daughter of the into his 
bed the the of all that the nations hold for 
the of the great man it is not napoleon who 
himself for the of his role so much as all 
those round him who prepare him to take on himself 
the whole responsibility for what is and has to happen 
there is no step no or he which in the 
of those around him is not at once as a 
great deed the most fete the can for him is 
a of and not only is he great but so 
are his his his and his everything is done to 
deprive him of the remains of his reason and to 
prepare him for his terrible part and when he is 
ready so too are the forces  the and its 
final goal that city is taken the russian army than 
the had in the former war from to but suddenly 
instead of those and that which had so led him 
by an of to the goal an of occur the 
cold in his head at to the which set moscow 
on fire and the instead of and become evident  
the turn back again and all the are now not 
for napoleon but always against him  a is then 
accomplished from east to west with a resemblance to the 
movement from west to east from east to west to 
the contrary movements of   and  the great 
movement there is the same into a group of enormous 
the same of the people of europe to the movement 
the same midway and the same as the goal is 
approached  paris the goal is reached the government and 
army are destroyed napoleon himself is no longer of any 
account all his actions are evidently and mean but again 
an the napoleon whom they regard as the cause of 
their sufferings of power and his and his exposed he 
should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years 
and one year later but by some strange no one 
this his part is not yet ended the man who 
ten years before and a year later was considered an 
is sent to an island two days sail from france 
which for some reason is to him as his and 
guards are given to him and millions of money are 
paid him      chapter iv  
 the of nations to into its the waves of 
the great movement and on the calm surface are formed 
in which the who imagine that they have the to 
 but the sea again suddenly disturbed the think that 
their are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural 
forces they war between their sovereigns the position seems to 
them but the they feel to be rising does not 
come from the they expect it again from the same 
point as before the last of the movement from the 
west a which serves to solve the apparently difficulties and 
the military movement of that period of history  the 
man who had france returns to france alone without any 
and without soldiers any might him but by strange no 
one does so and all the man they the day 
before and will again a month later  this man 
is still to justify the final act  that act 
is performed  the last role is played the actor 
is to and wash off his and paint he will 
not be wanted any more  and some years pass 
during which he a comedy to himself in on his 
island his actions by intrigues and lies when the is 
no longer and displaying to the whole world what it 
was that people had mistaken for strength as long as 
an unseen hand his actions  the manager having brought 
the to a close and the actor shows him to 
us   what you believed in this is he 
do you now see that it was not he but 
i who moved you  but by the force of 
the movement it was long before people understood this  
still greater and is seen in the life of alexander 
i the man who stood at the head of the 
from east to west  what was for him who 
others stood at the head of that movement from east 
to west  what was was a sense of and 
a sympathy with affairs but a sympathy not dulled by 
interests a superiority over those sovereigns of the day who 
with him a and attractive and a against napoleon and 
all this was found in alexander i all this had 
been prepared by so in his life his education his 
early the who him and by and and  during 
the war he was because he was not but as 
soon as the necessity for a general war itself he 
appeared in his place at the given moment and the 
nations of europe led them to the goal  the 
goal is reached after the final war of  alexander 
all possible power how does he use it  alexander 
i of europe the man who from his early years 
had only for his people welfare the of the in 
his that he seemed to the power and therefore to 
have the of bringing about the welfare of his the 
time when napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and 
of how he would have made mankind happy had he 
retained power i having his and feeling the hand of 
god upon him suddenly recognizes the of that power away 
from it and gives it into the hands of men 
whom he saying only   us not us but 
name i too am a man like the rest of 
you let me live like a man and think of 
my soul and of god  as the sun and 
each of is a complete in itself and yet at 
the same time only a part of a whole too 
immense for man to so each has within himself his 
own and yet has them to serve a general purpose 
to man  a settling on a flower has a 
child and the child is afraid of bees and declares 
that bees exist to people a the from the of 
a flower and says it to the of flowers a 
seeing the from flowers and carry it to the says 
that it to another who has studied the life of 
the more says that the dust to the young bees 
and a queen and that it to its race a 
notices that the flying with the of a male flower 
to a the latter and in this the purpose of 
the another the of plants notices that the in this 
work and may say that in this lies the purpose 
of the but the purpose of the is not exhausted 
by the first the second or any of the the 
human mind can the higher the human in the of 
these the more obvious it that the purpose is our 
 all that is to man is the relation of 
the life of the to other of life and so 
it is with the purpose of and nations   
   chapter v   natasha to bezukhov 
which took place in  was the last happy in 
the family of the old rostovs count ilya rostov died 
that same year and as always happens after the father 
death the family group broke up  the of the 
previous year the burning of moscow and the flight from 
it the death of prince andrew natasha despair petya death 
and the old countess fell blow after blow on the 
old count head he seemed to be unable to understand 
the meaning of all these and bowed his old head 
in a sense as if expecting and inviting further which 
would finish him he seemed now frightened and and now 
unnaturally animated and  the for natasha occupied him for 
a while he ordered and and obviously tried to appear 
cheerful but his was not as it used to be 
on the contrary it evoked the of those who knew 
and liked him  when pierre and his wife had 
left he grew very quiet and began to complain of 
a few days later he fell ill and took to 
his bed he realized from the first that he would 
not get up again despite the doctor the countess passed 
a in an armchair by his without every time she 
gave him his he sobbed and silently kissed her hand 
on his last day sobbing he asked her and his 
absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property 
being the chief of which he was conscious after receiving 
and he quietly died and next day a of who 
came to pay their last to the filled the house 
by the rostovs all these who had so often and 
danced at his house and had so often laughed at 
him now said with a common feeling of self and 
as if themselves  he may have been he was 
a most worthy man you don meet such men and 
which of us has not of his own  it 
was just when the count affairs had become so that 
it was impossible to say what would happen if he 
lived another year that he unexpectedly died  nicholas was 
with the russian army in paris when the news of 
his father death reached him he at once his and 
without waiting for it to be took leave of and 
went to moscow the state of the count affairs became 
quite obvious a month after his death surprising everyone by 
the immense of small the of which no one had 
suspected the to the value of the property  friends 
and relations nicholas to the but he regarded such a 
as a on his father memory which he held and 
therefore would not hear of and the together with the 
obligation to pay the  the who had so long 
been silent by a but powerful influence on them while 
he lived by the count careless good nature all to 
their at once as always happens in such up as 
to which should get paid first and those who like 
held notes given them as now became the most of 
the nicholas was allowed no and no peace and those 
who had seemed to pity the old man cause of 
their  they were the young heir who had the 
and was obviously not guilty of them  not one 
of the nicholas tried succeeded the was by for half 
its value and half the still remained nicholas thirty thousand 
rubles offered him by his brother bezukhov to pay off 
he regarded as for value received and to avoid being 
for the as the he the government service  he 
could not the army where he would have been made 
colonel at the next for his mother now clung to 
him as her one hold on life and so despite 
his to remain in moscow among people who had known 
him before and despite his of the civil service he 
a post in moscow in that service the uniform of 
which he was so fond and moved with his mother 
and sonya to a small house on the  natasha 
and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and 
had no clear idea of nicholas circumstances having money from 
his brother nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from 
him his position was the more difficult because with his 
of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep 
himself his mother and sonya but had to his mother 
from knowledge of their poverty the countess could not of 
life without the luxurious she had been used to from 
childhood and unable to how hard it was for her 
son kept now a carriage  they did not keep 
to send for a friend now some of food for 
herself or wine for her son or money to buy 
a present as a surprise for natasha or sonya or 
for nicholas himself  sonya kept house attended on her 
aunt read to her put up with her and secret 
ill and helped nicholas to their poverty from the old 
countess nicholas felt himself indebted to sonya for all she 
was doing for his mother and greatly her patience and 
devotion but tried to keep from her  he seemed 
in his heart to reproach her for being too and 
because there was nothing to reproach her with she had 
all that people are for but little that could have 
made him love her he felt that the more he 
her the less he loved her he had taken her 
at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom 
and now behaved as if all that had passed between 
them had been long forgotten and could never in any 
case be  nicholas position became worse and worse the 
idea of putting something aside out of his a not 
only did he not save anything but to comply with 
his mother he even some small he could see no 
way out of this situation the idea of marrying some 
rich woman which was suggested to him by his female 
relations was to him the other way out mother death 
entered his head he wished for nothing and for nothing 
and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern 
satisfaction in an of his position he tried to avoid 
his old with their and offensive of he all distraction 
and and even at home did nothing but play cards 
with his mother silently up and down the room and 
smoke one pipe after another he seemed carefully to within 
himself the gloomy mood which alone him to endure his 
position      chapter vi   
at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow 
from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs 
were and how  son has himself for his mother 
as people were saying   never expected anything else 
of him said princess mary to herself feeling a joyous 
sense of her love for him her friendly relations with 
all the rostovs which had made her almost a member 
of the family she thought it her duty to go 
to see them but her relations with nicholas in she 
was shy about doing so making a great effort she 
did however go to call on them a few after 
her arrival in moscow  nicholas was the first to 
meet her as the countess room could only be reached 
through his but instead of being greeted with pleasure as 
she had expected at his first glance at her his 
face assumed a cold proud expression she had not seen 
on it before he inquired about her health led the 
way to his mother and having sat there for five 
minutes left the room  when the princess came out 
of the countess room nicholas met her again and with 
solemnity and accompanied her to the anteroom to her remarks 
about his mother health he made no reply  that 
to you leave me in peace his looks seemed to 
say   does she come here what does she 
want i can bear these ladies and all these said 
he aloud in sonya presence evidently unable to his vexation 
after the princess carriage had   nicholas how can 
you talk like that cried sonya hardly able to her 
 is so kind and mamma is so fond of 
her  nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid 
speaking of the princess any more but after her visit 
the old countess spoke of her several times a day 
 she sang her that her son must call on 
her expressed a wish to see her often but yet 
always became ill when she began to talk about her 
 nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke 
of the princess but his silence her   is 
a very and excellent young woman said she  you

be seeing somebody and i think it must be dull 
for you only seeing us   i don in 
the least want to mamma   used to want

have got some or other in your head you hide 
everything from me   at all mamma   
i were asking you to do something disagreeable now i 
only ask you to return a call one would think 
mere politeness it well i have asked you and now 
i won interfere any more since you have secrets from 
your mother   then i go if you wish 
it   doesn matter to me i only wish 
it for your sake  nicholas bit his mustache and 
laid out the cards for a patience trying to his 
mother attention to another topic  the same conversation was 
repeated next day and the day after and the day 
after that  after her visit to the rostovs and 
her unexpectedly reception by nicholas princess mary to herself that 
she had been right in not wishing to be the 
first to call   expected nothing else she told 
herself calling her pride to her  have nothing to 
do with him and i only wanted to see the 
old lady who was always kind to me and to 
whom i am under many  but she could not 
herself with these reflections a feeling to her when she 
thought of her visit though she had firmly not to 
call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole 
matter she felt herself all the time in an awkward 
position and when she asked herself what distressed her she 
had to admit that it was her relation to rostov 
his cold polite manner did not express his feeling for 
her  knew that but it something and until she 
could what that something was she felt that she could 
not be at ease  one day in when sitting 
in the to her lessons she was that rostov had 
called with a firm resolution not to herself and not 
show her agitation she sent for mademoiselle and went with 
her to the drawing room  her first glance at 
nicholas face told her that he had only come to 
fulfill the of politeness and she firmly to maintain the 
tone in which he addressed her  they spoke of 
the countess health of their friends of the latest war 
news and when the ten minutes by had elapsed after 
which a visitor may rise nicholas got up to say 
good  with mademoiselle help the princess had the conversation 
very well but at the very last moment just when 
he rose she was so tired of talking of what 
did not interest her and her mind was so full 
of the question why she alone was so little happiness 
in life that in a fit of absent she sat 
still her eyes gazing fixedly before her not noticing that 
he had  nicholas glanced at her and wishing to 
appear not to notice her made some remark to mademoiselle 
and then again looked at the princess she still sat 
with a look of suffering on her gentle face he 
suddenly felt sorry for her and was conscious that he 
might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed 
he wished to help her and say something pleasant but 
could think of nothing to say   princess said 
he  she started flushed and deeply   i 
beg your she said as if waking up  you 
going already count well then good oh but the for 
the countess   a moment i it said mademoiselle 
and she left the room  they both sat silent 
with an glance at one another   princess said 
nicholas at last with a sad smile  doesn seem 
long ago since we first met at but how much 
water has since then in what distress we all seemed 
to be then yet i would give much to bring 
back that time but there no bringing it back  
princess mary gazed into his eyes with her own ones 
as he said this she seemed to be trying to 
the meaning of his words which would explain his feeling 
for her   yes said she  you have 
no reason to regret the past count as i understand 
your present life i think you will always it with 
satisfaction because the self that it now   cannot 
accept your praise he interrupted her hurriedly  the contrary 
i continually reproach myself but this is not at all 
an interesting or cheerful subject  his face again resumed 
its former and cold expression but the princess had caught 
a of the man she had known and loved and 
it was to him that she now spoke   
thought you would allow me to tell you this she 
said  had come so near to you and to 
all your family that i thought you would not consider 
my sympathy but i was mistaken and suddenly her voice 
trembled  don know why she continued herself  you 
used to be different and   are a thousand 
reasons why laying special emphasis on the why  you 
princess he added softly  it is hard   
that why that why a voice whispered in princess mary 
soul  it was not only that gay kind and 
frank look not only that handsome that i loved in 
him i his noble resolute self spirit too she said 
to herself  he is poor now and i am 
rich yes that the only reason yes were it not 
for that and his former tenderness and looking now at 
his kind face she suddenly understood the cause of his 
  why count why she almost cried moving closer 
to him  tell me you must tell me  
he was silent   don understand your why count 
she continued  it hard for me i confess it 
for some reason you wish to deprive me of our 
former friendship and that me there were tears in her 
eyes and in her voice  have had so little 
happiness in life that every is hard for me to 
bear excuse me good and suddenly she began to cry 
and was hurrying from the room   for god 
sake he exclaimed trying to stop her   she 
turned round for a few they gazed silently into one 
another eyes what had seemed impossible and suddenly became possible 
and very near      chapter vii 
  in the winter of  nicholas married princess 
mary and moved to bald hills with his wife his 
mother and sonya  within four years he had paid 
off all his remaining without any of his wife property 
and having received a small on the death of a 
cousin he paid his to pierre as well  in 
another three years by  he had so managed his 
affairs that he was able to buy a small adjoining 
bald hills and was to buy back being his pet 
 having started from necessity he soon grew so devoted 
to it that it became his favorite and almost his 
sole occupation nicholas was a plain he did not like 
especially the english ones then coming into vogue he laughed 
at on the raising of products and the of and 
did not make a of any particular part of the 
work on his he always had before his mind eye 
the as a whole and not any particular part of 
it the chief thing in his eyes was not the 
in the soil nor the in the air nor nor 
special but that most important by which and were made 
when nicholas first began and began to understand its different 
branches it was the who especially his attention the seemed 
to him not merely a but also a judge of 
and an end in himself at first he watched the 
serfs trying to understand their and what they considered good 
and bad and only pretended to direct them and give 
orders while in learning from them their their manner of 
speech and their of what was good and bad only 
when he had understood the and had learned to talk 
their language to the meaning of their words and felt 
to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs 
that is to perform toward them the duties demanded of 
him and nicholas produced very brilliant  by some of 
on taking up the of the estates he at once 
appointed as village elder and the very men the serfs 
would themselves have had they had the right to choose 
and these never changed hands before the of before entering 
into the and  he ironically called it he found 
out how many cattle the had and the number by 
all possible means he kept the families together in the 
groups possible not allowing the family groups to into separate 
households he was hard alike on the the and the 
weak and tried to get them expelled from the  
he was as of the and reaping of the and 
as of his own and few had their crops and 
so early and so well or got so good a 
return as did nicholas  he having anything to do 
with the serfs  as he called them everyone said 
he spoiled them by his when a decision had to 
be taken regarding a especially if one had to be 
he always felt and everybody in the house but when 
it was possible to have a instead of a land 
he did so without the least he never felt any 
in with the he knew that his every decision would 
be by them all with very few  he did 
not allow himself either to be hard on or a 
man or to make things easy for or reward anyone 
merely because he felt inclined to do so he could 
not have said by what he what he should or 
should not do but the was quite firm and definite 
in his own mind  often speaking with vexation of 
some or he would say  can one do with 
our russian and imagined that he could not bear them 
 yet he loved  russian and their way of 
life with his whole soul and for that very reason 
had understood and the one way and manner of which 
produced good  countess mary was of this of her 
husband and that she could not it but she could 
not understand the joys and he from that world to 
her so and she could not understand why he was 
so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at 
and spending the whole morning in the or on the 
floor he returned from the or or reaping to have 
tea with her she did not understand why he spoke 
with such and of the of the and well who 
with his family had all night or of the fact 
that his  were already before anyone else had his 
in she did not understand why he stepped out from 
the window to the and smiled under his mustache and 
so joyfully when warm steady rain began to fall on 
the dry and of the young or why when the 
wind carried away a threatening cloud during the he would 
return from the flushed and with a smell of and 
in his hair and rubbing his hands would say  
one more day and my and the will all be 
under  still less did she understand why he kindhearted 
and always ready to her wishes should become almost desperate 
when she brought him a from some men or women 
who had to her to be some work why he 
that kind nicholas should refuse her angrily asking her not 
to interfere in what was not her business she felt 
he had a world apart which he loved passionately and 
which had she had not  sometimes when trying to 
understand him she spoke of the good work he was 
doing for his serfs he would be vexed and reply 
 in the least it never entered my head and 
i do that for their good that all and old 
talk that doing good to one what i want is 
that our children should not have to go begging i 
must put our affairs in order while i am that 
all and to do that order and are essential that 
all about it said he his vigorous  of course 
he added  if the is and and has only 
one horse he can do no good either for himself 
or for me  and all nicholas did was just 
because he refused to allow himself to think that he 
was doing good to others for sake his means rapidly 
serfs from estates came to beg him to buy them 
and long after his death the memory of his was 
preserved among the serfs  was a the affairs first 
and then his own of course he was not to 
be with either a word he was a real  
    chapter viii   one matter 
connected with his sometimes nicholas and that was his quick 
together with his old hussar habit of making free use 
of his at first he saw nothing in this but 
in the second year of his his of that form 
of suddenly changed  once in summer he had sent 
for the village elder from a man who had succeeded 
to the post when died and who was of and 
nicholas went out into the porch to question him and 
immediately after the elder had given a few the sound 
of and were heard on returning to nicholas went up 
to his wife who sat with her head bent low 
over her embroidery frame and as usual began to tell 
her what he had been doing that morning among other 
things he spoke of the elder countess mary turned red 
and then pale but continued to sit with head bowed 
and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply  
 an insolent he cried growing hot again at the 
mere of him  he had told me he was 
drunk and did not see but what is the matter 
with you mary he suddenly asked  countess mary raised 
her head and tried to speak but hastily looked down 
again and her lips puckered   is the matter 
my  the looks of the plain countess mary always 
when she was in tears she never cried from or 
vexation but always from sorrow or pity and when she 
wept her radiant eyes an  the moment nicholas took 
her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began 
to cry   i saw it he was to 
but why do you nicholas and she covered her face 
with her hands  nicholas said nothing he flushed crimson 
left her side and up and down the room he 
understood what she was weeping about but could not in 
his heart at once agree with her that what he 
had regarded from childhood as quite an was wrong  
it just old or is she right he asked himself 
before he had solved that point he glanced again at 
her face filled with love and and he suddenly realized 
that she was right and that he had long been 
against himself   he said softly going up to 
her  will never happen again i give you my 
word never he repeated in a voice like a boy 
asking for forgiveness  the tears still from the countess 
eyes she took his hand and kissed it   
when did you break your she asked to change the 
subject looking at his finger on which he wore a 
ring with a of head   was the same 
affair oh mary don me of it and again he 
flushed  give you my word of honor it occur 
again and let this always be a to me and 
he pointed to the broken ring  after that when 
in with his village elders or the blood rushed to 
his face and his began to nicholas would turn the 
broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes 
before the man who was making him angry but he 
did forget himself once or twice within a and then 
he would go and confess to his wife and would 
again promise that this should really be the very last 
time   you must me he would say  
deserve it   should go go away at once 
if you don feel strong enough to control yourself she 
would reply sadly trying to her husband  among the 
of the nicholas was respected but not liked he did 
not himself with the interests of his own class and 
some thought him proud and others thought him stupid the 
whole summer from spring to he was busy with the 
work on his farm in he gave himself up to 
hunting with the same business like home for a month 
or even two with his hunt in winter he his 
other or spent his time reading the he read were 
chiefly and on these he spent a certain sum every 
year he was collecting as he said a serious library 
and he made it a rule to read through all 
the he he would sit in his study with a 
grave air reading task he first upon himself as a 
duty but which afterwards became a habit him a special 
kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with 
serious matters in winter except for business he spent most 
of his time at home making himself one with his 
family and entering into all the of his children relations 
with their mother the between him and his wife grew 
closer and closer and he discovered fresh in her  
from the time of his sonya had lived in his 
house before that nicholas had told his wife all that 
had passed between himself and sonya himself and her he 
had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to 
his cousin she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done 
sonya felt herself to toward her and imagined that her 
wealth had nicholas choice she could not find with sonya 
in any way and tried to be fond of her 
but often felt ill toward her which she could not 
 once she had a talk with her friend natasha 
about sonya and about her own toward her   
know said natasha  have read the a great deal 
is a passage in them that just fits sonya  
 asked countess mary surprised   him that shall 
be given and from him that not shall be taken 
away you remember she is one that not why i 
don know perhaps she egotism i don know but from 
her is taken away and everything has been taken away 
sometimes i am sorry for her i very much wanted 
nicholas to marry her but i always had a sort 
of that it would not come off she is a 
flower you know some sometimes i am sorry for her 
and sometimes i think she doesn feel it as you 
or i would  though countess mary told natasha that 
those words in the must be understood differently yet looking 
at sonya she agreed with natasha it really seemed that 
sonya did not feel her position trying and had grown 
quite to her lot as a flower she seemed to 
be fond not so much of as of the family 
as a whole like a cat she had attached herself 
not to the people but to the home she waited 
on the old countess and spoiled the children was always 
ready to the small for which she had a and 
all this was from her with gratitude  the country 
seat at bald hills had been though not on the 
same scale as under the old prince  the under 
circumstances were more than simple the immense house on the 
old stone foundations was of wood only inside it had 
bare deal and was with very simple hard tables and 
chairs made by their own out of their own the 
house was and had rooms for the house serfs and 
apartments for visitors whole families of the rostovs and relations 
sometimes came to bald hills with sixteen horses and of 
and stayed for months besides that four times a year 
on the name days and of the as many as 
a hundred visitors would there for a day or two 
the rest of the year life its with its ordinary 
and its and out of the produce of the  
    chapter ix   it was 
the of st nicholas the of  natasha had been 
staying at her brother with her husband and children since 
early pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his 
own for three as he said but had remained there 
nearly seven and was expected back every minute  besides 
the bezukhov family nicholas old friend the general vasili was 
staying with the rostovs this of  on the which 
was his name day when the house would be full 
of visitors nicholas knew he would have to his for 
a tail coat and put on with pointed and drive 
to the new he had built and then receive visitors 
who would come to congratulate him them and talk about 
the of the but he considered himself to spend the 
of that day in his usual way he examined the 
accounts of the village in which belonged to his wife 
wrote two business and walked over to the cattle and 
before dinner having taken against the general to be expected 
on the because it was a great saint day he 
returned to dinner and without having time for a private 
talk with his wife sat down at the long table 
laid for twenty persons at which the whole household had 
assembled at that table were his mother his mother old 
lady companion his wife their three children with their governess 
and tutor his wife with his tutor sonya natasha her 
three children their governess and old michael the late prince 
who was living on in at bald hills  countess 
mary sat at the other end of the table when 
her husband took his place she concluded from the manner 
in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed 
back the tumbler and standing before him that he was 
out of as was sometimes the case when he came 
in to dinner straight from the farm before the countess 
mary well knew that mood of his and when she 
herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited 
till he had had his and then began to talk 
to him and make him admit that there was no 
cause for his ill but today she quite forgot that 
and was hurt that he should be angry with her 
without any reason and she felt unhappy she asked him 
where he had been he replied she again inquired whether 
everything was going well on the farm her unnatural tone 
made him and he replied hastily   i not 
mistaken thought countess mary  is he cross with me 
she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with 
her and wished to end the conversation she knew her 
remarks sounded unnatural but could not refrain from asking some 
more questions  to the conversation at table soon became 
general and lively and she did not talk to her 
husband when they left the table and went as usual 
to thank the old countess countess mary held out her 
hand and kissed her husband and asked him why he 
was angry with her   always have such strange 
fancies i didn even think of being angry he replied 
 but the word always seemed to her to  
i am angry but i won tell you why  
nicholas and his wife lived together so that even sonya 
and the old countess who felt and would have liked 
them to could find nothing to reproach them with but 
even they had their moments of occasionally and it was 
always just after they had been together they suddenly had 
a feeling of and which occurred most frequently during countess 
mary and this was such a time   said 
nicholas loudly and with apparent  seemed to countess mary 
that he did it on purpose to her  have 
been on my feet since six this morning tomorrow i 
shall have to suffer so today i go and rest 
 and without a word to his wife he went 
to the little sitting room and lay down on the 
sofa   always the way thought countess mary  
to everyone except me i see i see that i 
am to him especially when i am in this condition 
she looked down at her figure and in the glass 
at her pale sallow face in which her eyes now 
looked larger than ever  and everything her shouting and 
laughter natasha talk and especially a quick glance sonya gave 
her  sonya was always the first excuse countess mary 
found for feeling  having sat with her visitors without 
understanding anything of what they were saying she softly left 
the room and went to the nursery  the children 
were playing at  to moscow in a carriage made 
of chairs and her to go with them she sat 
down and played with them a little but the thought 
of her husband and his her she got up and 
on with difficulty went to the small sitting room  
 he is not i have an with him she 
said to herself little andrew her eldest boy his mother 
followed her on she did not notice him   
dear i think he is was so tired said sonya 
meeting her in the large sitting room  seemed to 
countess mary that she her path everywhere  may him 
 countess mary looked round saw little andrew following her 
felt that sonya was right and for that very reason 
flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something she 
made no reply but to avoid sonya to andrew to 
follow her quietly and went to the door sonya went 
away by another door from the room in which nicholas 
was came the sound of his even breathing every slightest 
tone of which was familiar to his wife as she 
listened to it she saw before her his handsome forehead 
his mustache and his whole face as she had so 
often seen it in the of the night when he 
nicholas suddenly moved and his and at that moment little 
andrew shouted from outside the door  mamma standing here 
countess mary turned pale with and made signs to the 
boy he grew silent and quiet ensued for a moment 
terrible to countess mary she knew how nicholas being then 
through the door she heard nicholas his again and stirring 
and his voice said crossly   can get a 
moment peace mary is that you why did you bring 
him here   only came in to look and 
did not notice forgive me  nicholas and said no 
more countess mary moved away from the door and took 
the boy back to the nursery five minutes later little 
black three natasha her father pet having learned from her 
brother that papa was and mamma was in the sitting 
room ran to her father by her mother the dark 
little girl boldly opened the door went up to the 
sofa with steps of her little legs and having examined 
the position of her father who was with his back 
to her rose on and kissed the hand which lay 
under his head nicholas turned with a tender smile on 
his face   natasha came countess mary frightened whisper 
from the door  wants to sleep   mamma 
he doesn want to sleep said little natasha with conviction 
 laughing  nicholas lowered his legs rose and took 
his daughter in his arms   in mary he 
said to his wife  she went in and sat 
down by her husband   did not notice him 
following me she said timidly  just looked in  
holding his little girl with one arm nicholas glanced at 
his wife and seeing her guilty expression put his other 
arm around her and kissed her hair   i 
kiss mamma he asked natasha  natasha smiled   
she pointing with a gesture to the spot where nicholas 
had placed the kiss   don know why you 
think i am cross said nicholas to the question he 
knew was in his wife mind   have no 
idea how unhappy how lonely i feel when you are 
like that it always seems to me   don 
talk nonsense you ought to be ashamed of yourself he 
said gaily   seems to be that you can 
love me that i am so plain always and now 
in this   how absurd you are it is 
not beauty that it love that makes us see beauty 
it is only and women of that kind who are 
loved for their beauty but do i love my wife 
i don love her but i don know how to 
put it without you or when something comes between us 
like this i seem lost and can do anything now 
do i love my finger i don love it but 
just try to cut it off   not like 
that myself but i understand so you not angry with 
me   angry he said smiling and getting up 
and smoothing his hair he began to the room  
 you know mary what i been thinking he began 
immediately thinking aloud in his wife presence now that they 
had made it up  he did not ask if 
she was ready to listen to him he did not 
care a thought had occurred to him and so it 
belonged to her also and he told her of his 
intention to pierre to stay with them till spring  
countess mary listened till he had finished made some remark 
and in her turn began thinking aloud her thoughts were 
about the children   can see the woman in 
her already she said in french pointing to little natasha 
 reproach us women with being here is our i 
say  wants to sleep but she says  he 
laughing and she was right said countess mary with a 
happy smile   yes and nicholas taking his little 
daughter in his strong hand lifted her high placed her 
on his shoulder held her by the legs and the 
room with her there was an expression of happiness on 
the faces of both father and daughter   you 
know you may be you are too fond of this 
one his wife whispered in french   but what 
am i to do i try not to show  
at that moment they heard the sound of the door 
and footsteps in the hall and anteroom as if someone 
had arrived   has come   am sure 
it is pierre i will go and see said countess 
mary and left the room  in her nicholas allowed 
himself to give his little daughter a round the room 
out of he took the laughing child quickly from his 
shoulder and pressed her to his heart his reminded him 
of dancing and looking at the child round happy little 
face he thought of what she would be like when 
he was an old man taking her into society and 
dancing the with her as his old father had danced 
with his daughter   is he it is he 
nicholas said countess mary the room a few minutes later 
 our natasha has come to life you should have 
seen her and how he caught it for having stayed 
away so long well come along now quick quick it 
time you two were she added looking smilingly at the 
little girl who clung to her father  nicholas went 
out holding the child by the hand  countess mary 
remained in the sitting room   should never never 
have believed that one could be so happy she whispered 
to herself a smile lit up her face but at 
the same time she and her deep eyes expressed a 
quiet sadness as though she felt through her happiness that 
there is another sort of happiness in this life and 
of which she thought at that instant    
  chapter x   natasha had married in 
the early spring of  and in  already had 
three daughters besides a son for whom she had and 
whom she was now she had grown and so that 
it was difficult to recognize in this woman the lively 
natasha of former days her features were more and had 
a calm soft and serene expression in her face there 
was none of the ever animation that had there and 
its now her face and body were often all that 
one saw and her soul was not visible at all 
all that struck the eye was a strong handsome and 
woman the old fire very in her face now that 
happened only when as was the case that day her 
husband returned home or a child was or when she 
and countess mary spoke of prince andrew  never mentioned 
him to her husband who she imagined was of prince 
andrew memory or on the rare when something happened to 
her to sing a practice she had quite since her 
at the rare moments when the old fire did in 
her handsome fully developed body she was even more attractive 
than in former days  since their natasha and her 
husband had lived in moscow in petersburg on their near 
moscow or with her mother that is to say in 
nicholas house the young countess was not often seen in 
society and those who met her there were not pleased 
with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable not 
that natasha liked did not know whether she liked it 
or not she even thought that she did not with 
her her the of her children and sharing every moment 
of her husband life she had on her time which 
could be satisfied only by society all who had known 
natasha before her wondered at the change in her as 
at something extraordinary only the old countess with her had 
realized that all natasha had been to her need of 
children and a husband she herself had once exclaimed at 
not so much in fun as in her mother was 
now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had 
never understood natasha and she kept saying that she had 
always known that natasha would make an wife and mother 
  she her love of her husband and children 
all bounds said the countess  that it even absurd 
 natasha did not follow the rule by clever especially 
by the french which says that a girl should not 
let herself go when she should not her should be 
even more of her appearance than when she was unmarried 
and should her husband as much as she did before 
he became her husband natasha on the contrary had at 
once all her of which her had been an powerful 
part she gave it up just because it was so 
she took no with her manners or with delicacy of 
speech or with her or to show herself to her 
husband in her most becoming or to avoid him by 
being too she acted in to all those she felt 
that the had taught her to use would now be 
merely in the eyes of her husband to whom she 
had from the first moment given herself up entirely is 
with her whole soul leaving no corner of it from 
him she felt that her with her husband was not 
by the that had him to her but by something 
else but firm as the between her own body and 
soul  to out her curls put on fashionable dresses 
and sing to her husband would have seemed as strange 
as to herself to attract herself to herself for others 
might perhaps have been agreeable did not know she had 
no time at all for it the chief reason for 
no time either to to dress or to choosing her 
words was that she really had no time to spare 
for these things  we know that man has the 
of becoming completely in a subject however trivial it may 
be and that there is no subject so trivial that 
it will not grow to if one attention is devoted 
to it  the subject which natasha attention was her 
family that is her husband whom she had to keep 
so that he should belong entirely to her and to 
the home and the children whom she had to bear 
bring into the world nurse and bring up  and 
the deeper she not with her mind only but with 
her whole soul her whole being into the subject that 
her the larger did that subject grow and the and 
more did her appear so that she concentrated them on 
that one thing and yet was unable to all that 
she considered necessary  there were then as now conversations 
and about women rights the relations of husband and wife 
and their freedom and rights though these were not yet 
questions as they are now but these topics were not 
merely to natasha she did not understand them  these 
questions then as now only for those who see nothing 
in but the pleasure married people get from one another 
that is only the of and not its whole which 
lies in the family  and questions of that kind 
which are like the question of how to get the 
greatest from one dinner did not then and do not 
now exist for those for whom the purpose of a 
dinner is the it and the purpose of is the 
family  if the purpose of dinner is to the 
body a man who eats two at once may perhaps 
get more enjoyment but will not his purpose for his 
will not the two  if the purpose of is 
the family the person who wishes to have many or 
husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure but in that case 
will not have a family  if the purpose of 
food is and the purpose of is the family the 
whole question itself into not more than one can and 
not having more or husbands than are for the family 
is one wife or one husband natasha a husband a 
husband was given her and he gave her a family 
and she not only saw no need of any other 
or better husband but as all the of her soul 
were intent on serving that husband and family she could 
not imagine and saw no interest in how it would 
be if things were different  natasha did not care 
for society in general but the more the society of 
her relatives mary and her brother her mother and sonya 
she the company of those to whom she could come 
from the nursery in her gown and with joyful face 
show a instead of a green on baby napkin and 
from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect 
that baby was much better  to such an had 
natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and 
did her hair her ill words and her jealousy was 
of sonya of the governess and of every woman pretty 
or plain habitual of to those about her the general 
opinion was that pierre was under his wife which was 
really true from the very first days of their married 
life natasha had announced her pierre was greatly surprised by 
his wife to him a perfectly one that every moment 
of his life belonged to her and to the family 
his wife astonished him but they also flattered him and 
he to them  pierre in the fact that he 
not only dared not flirt with but dared not even 
speak smilingly to any other woman did not dine at 
the club as a did not spend money on a 
whim and did not absent himself for any length of 
time except on business which his wife his intellectual which 
she did not in the least understand but to which 
she great importance to make up for this at home 
pierre had the right to his life and that of 
the whole family exactly as he chose at home natasha 
placed herself in the position of a slave to her 
husband and the whole household went on when he was 
occupied is was reading or in his study pierre had 
but to show a for anything to get just what 
he liked done always he had only to express a 
wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill 
it  the household was to pierre orders that is 
by his wishes which natasha tried to guess their way 
of life and place of their and natasha the children 
were all not merely with regard to pierre expressed wishes 
but to what natasha from the thoughts he expressed in 
conversation his wishes to be and she the of his 
wishes quite and having once arrived at them clung to 
them when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she 
would fight him with his own  thus in a 
time of trouble ever to him after the of their 
first child who was delicate when they had to change 
the nurse three times and natasha fell ill from despair 
pierre one day told her of with which he quite 
agreed that to have a nurse is unnatural and when 
her next baby was born despite the of her mother 
the doctors and even of her husband himself were all 
to her her baby herself a thing then of and 
considered on having her own way and after that all 
her herself  it very often happened that in a 
moment of irritation husband and wife would have a but 
long afterwards pierre to his surprise and would find in 
his wife ideas and actions the very thought against which 
she had but of everything that in the excitement of 
the he had added when expressing his opinion  after 
seven years of pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness 
that he was not a bad man and he felt 
this because he saw himself reflected in his wife he 
felt the good and bad within himself mingled and but 
only what was really good in him was reflected in 
his wife all that was not quite good was and 
this was not the result of but was a direct 
and      chapter xi   
two months when pierre was already staying with the rostovs 
he had received a letter from prince asking him to 
come to petersburg to on some important questions that were 
being discussed there by a society of which pierre was 
one of the  on reading that letter  always 
read her husband natasha herself suggested that he should go 
to petersburg though she would feel his very she immense 
importance to all her husband intellectual and abstract interests though 
she did not understand them and she always being a 
to him in such matters to pierre timid look of 
inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him 
to go but to a definite for his return he 
was given four leave of  ever since that leave 
of had more than a before natasha had been in 
a constant state of alarm and  now a general 
on the list and much dissatisfied with the present state 
of affairs had arrived during that he looked at natasha 
with sorrow and surprise as at a bad of a 
person once dear a dull look random and talk about 
the nursery was all he saw and heard from his 
former  natasha was sad and all that time especially 
when her mother her brother sonya or countess mary in 
their to console her tried to excuse pierre and suggested 
reasons for his delay in returning   all nonsense 
all which lead to nothing and all those natasha declared 
of the very affairs in the immense importance of which 
she firmly believed  and she would go to the 
nursery to nurse petya her only boy no one else 
could tell her anything so comforting or so as this 
little three creature when he lay at her breast and 
she was conscious of the movement of his lips and 
the of his little nose that creature said  are 
angry you are you would like to pay him out 
you are afraid here am i and i am he 
and that was it was more than true  during 
that of anxiety natasha to the baby for so often 
and over him so much that she him and he 
fell ill she was terrified by his illness and yet 
that was just what she while to him she bore 
the anxiety about her husband more easily  she was 
her boy when the sound of pierre was heard at 
the front door and the old nurse how to please 
her the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming 
face   he come natasha asked quickly in a 
whisper afraid to move she should rouse the baby  
 come ma whispered the nurse  the blood rushed 
to natasha face and her feet moved but she could 
not jump up and run out the baby again opened 
his eyes and looked at her  here he seemed 
to be saying and again his lips  her breast 
natasha him a little him to the nurse and went 
with steps toward the door but at the door she 
stopped as if her conscience her for having in her 
joy left the child too soon and she glanced round 
the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the over the 
of his   ma don go she whispered smiling 
with the kind of familiarity that up between a nurse 
and her  natasha ran with light footsteps to the 
anteroom  who had come out of the study into 
the dancing room with his pipe now for the first 
time recognized the old natasha a of brilliant joyful light 
from her face   come she exclaimed as she 
ran past and felt that he too was delighted that 
pierre whom he did not much care for had returned 
 on reaching the natasha saw a tall figure in 
a coat his scarf  he it really he he 
has come she said to herself and rushing at him 
embraced him pressed his head to her breast and then 
pushed him back and gazed at his happy face covered 
with  it is he happy and  then all 
at once she remembered the of she had experienced for 
the last and the joy that had lit up her 
face vanished she frowned and pierre with a of and 
angry words   it all very well for you 
you are pleased you had a good time but what 
about me you might at least have shown consideration for 
the children i am and my milk was spoiled petya 
was at death door but you were yourself yes  
pierre knew he was not to for he could not 
have come sooner he knew this outburst was and would 
blow over in a minute or two above all he 
knew that he himself was bright and happy he wanted 
to smile but dared not even think of doing so 
he made a piteous frightened face and bent down  
 could not on my honor but how is petya 
  right now come along i wonder you not 
ashamed if only you could see what i was like 
without you how i   are well   
come she said not letting go of his arm and 
they went to their rooms  when nicholas and his 
wife came to look for pierre he was in the 
nursery holding his baby son who was again on his 
huge right palm and him a bright smile was fixed 
on the baby broad face with its open mouth the 
was long since over and there was bright joyous on 
natasha face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and 
child   have you talked everything well over with 
prince she asked     see he it 
up  meant the baby head  how he did 
me you seen the princess is it true she in 
love with that   just fancy  at that 
moment nicholas and countess mary came in pierre with the 
baby on his hand stooped kissed them and replied to 
their but in spite of much that was interesting and 
had to be discussed the baby with the little cap 
on its head evidently all his attention   sweet 
said countess mary looking at and playing with the baby 
 nicholas she added turning to her husband  can 
understand how it is you don see the of these 
  don and can replied nicholas looking coldly at 
the baby  of come along pierre   yet 
he such an affectionate father said countess mary her husband 
 only after they are a year old or so 
  pierre them splendidly said natasha  says his 
hand is just made for a baby seat just look 
  not for this pierre suddenly exclaimed with a 
laugh and the baby he gave him to the nurse 
     chapter xii   as 
in every large household there were at bald hills several 
perfectly distinct which into one whole though each retained its 
own and made to the others every joyful or sad 
that took place in that house was important to all 
these but each had its own special reasons to rejoice 
or over that of the others  for pierre return 
was a joyful and important and they all felt it 
to be so  the most of their because they 
judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but 
by their acts and way of life glad of pierre 
return because they knew that when he was there count 
nicholas would going every day to attend to the and 
would be in better and and also because they would 
all receive handsome for the  the children and their 
governesses were glad of pierre return because no one else 
drew them into the social life of the household as 
he did he alone could play on the clavichord that 
 only piece to which as he said all possible 
could be danced and they felt sure he had brought 
for them all  young nicholas now a lad of 
fifteen delicate and intelligent with curly light hair and beautiful 
eyes was delighted because uncle pierre as he called him 
was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection no 
one had into him this love for pierre whom he 
saw only occasionally countess mary who had brought him up 
had done her to make him love her husband as 
she loved him and little nicholas did love his uncle 
but loved him with just a of pierre however he 
adored he did not want to be an hussar or 
a of st george like his uncle nicholas he wanted 
to be learned and kind like pierre in pierre presence 
his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and 
was when pierre spoke to him he did not miss 
a single word he uttered and would afterwards with or 
by himself and the meaning of everything pierre had said 
pierre past life and his to   which young 
nicholas had formed a picture from some words he had 
his in moscow his  whom he had heard from 
pierre his love for natasha  whom the lad was 
also particularly fond and especially pierre friendship with the father 
whom nicholas could not remember this made pierre in his 
eyes a hero and a saint  from broken remarks 
about natasha and his father from the with which pierre 
spoke of that dead father and from the tenderness with 
which natasha spoke of him the boy who was only 
just beginning to guess what love is the that his 
father had loved natasha and when dying had left her 
to his friend but the father whom the boy did 
not remember appeared to him a who could not be 
and of whom he never thought without a heart and 
tears of sadness and so the boy also was happy 
that pierre had arrived  the guests pierre because he 
always helped to and any company he was in  
the grown members of the family not to mention his 
wife were pleased to have back a friend whose presence 
made life run more smoothly and  the old ladies 
were pleased with the he brought them and especially that 
natasha would now be herself again  pierre felt the 
different of these and made to all their expectations  
though the most absent and of men pierre with the 
of a list his wife drew up had now everything 
not forgetting his mother brother nor the dress material for 
a present to nor for his wife in the early 
days of his it had seemed strange to him that 
his wife should expect him not to forget to procure 
all the things he to buy and he had been 
taken by her serious annoyance when on his first trip 
he forgot everything but in time he grew used to 
this demand knowing that natasha asked nothing for herself and 
gave him for others only when he himself had offered 
to them he now found an and childlike pleasure in 
this of for everyone in the house and never forgot 
anything if he now natasha censure it was only for 
too many and too things to her other  most 
people thought them but which to pierre were qualities of 
and of herself she now added  from the time 
that pierre began life as a family man on a 
footing heavy he had noticed to his surprise that he 
spent only half as much as before and that his 
affairs had been in of late chiefly because of his 
first wife to  life was because it was that 
most the kind of life that can be changed at 
any moment was no longer his nor did he wish 
for it he felt that his way of life had 
now been settled once for all till death and that 
to change it was not in his power and so 
that way of life  with a merry smiling face 
pierre was his   do you think of this 
said he a piece of like a  natasha who 
was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on 
her turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to 
the things he showed her   for excellent she 
felt the of the material  was a an i 
suppose  pierre told her the   dear natasha 
remarked  pleased the children will be and mamma too 
only you need not have me this she added unable 
to suppress a smile as she gazed at a gold 
set with of a kind then just coming into fashion 
  me she kept on telling me to buy 
it returned pierre   am i to wear it 
and natasha stuck it in her of hair  i 
take little into society perhaps they will be fashionable again 
by then well let go now  and collecting the 
they went first to the nursery and then to the 
old countess rooms  the countess was sitting with her 
companion playing grand as usual when pierre and natasha came 
into the drawing room with under their arms  the 
countess was now over was quite gray and wore a 
cap with a frill that her face her face had 
her upper lip had in and her eyes were  
after the of her son and husband in such she 
felt herself a being forgotten in this world and left 
without aim or object for her she ate drank or 
kept but did not live life gave her no new 
she wanted nothing from life but and that only death 
could give her but until death came she had to 
go on living that is to use her forces a 
peculiarity one in very young children and very old people 
was particularly evident in her her life had no a 
need to exercise her and was apparent she had to 
eat sleep think speak work give to her anger and 
so on merely because she had a a and a 
she did these things not under any impulse as people 
in the full of life do when behind the purpose 
for which they that of their remains she talked only 
because she physically to exercise her tongue and she cried 
as a child does because her nose had to be 
and so on what for people in their full is 
an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext  
thus in the morning if she had anything rich the 
day before felt a need of being angry and would 
choose as the pretext  she would begin to say 
something to her in a low tone from the other 
end of the room   seems a little warmer 
today my dear she would  and when replied  
yes they come she would angrily  how stupid and 
she is  another pretext would be her which would 
seem too dry or too or not rubbed fine enough 
after these fits of her face would grow and her 
maids knew by when would again be the and the 
countess face just as she to work off her so 
she had sometimes to exercise her still of thinking the 
pretext for that was a game of patience when she 
to cry the count would be the pretext when she 
wanted to be agitated nicholas and his health would be 
the pretext and when she felt a need to speak 
the pretext would be countess mary when her exercise which 
was usually toward seven o when she had had an 
after rest in a room the pretext would be the 
of the same stories over and over again to the 
same audience  the old lady condition was understood by 
the whole household though no one ever spoke of it 
and they all made every possible effort to her only 
by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between 
nicholas pierre natasha and countess mary was the common understanding 
of her condition expressed  but those glances expressed something 
more they said that she had played her part in 
life that what they now saw was not her whole 
self that we must all become like her and that 
they were glad to to her to restrain themselves for 
this once precious being as full of life as themselves 
but now so much to be pitied  said these 
glances  only the really heartless the stupid ones of 
that household and the little children failed to understand this 
and her      chapter xiii  
 when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room 
the countess was in one of her in which she 
the mental of playing patience and so by force of 
habit she greeted him with the words she always used 
when pierre or her son returned after an  time 
my dear high time we were all weary of waiting 
for you well thank god and received her with another 
remark  not the that precious my dear but that 
you give it to me an old woman it was 
evident that she was not pleased by pierre arrival at 
that moment when it her attention from the game  
she finished her game of patience and only then examined 
the they of a box for cards of splendid a 
bright tea cup with on it and with a and 
a gold snuffbox with the count portrait on the which 
pierre had had done by a in petersburg the countess 
had long wished for such a box but as she 
did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently 
at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the 
box for cards   you my dear you have 
me up said she as she always did  best 
of all you have brought yourself back i never saw 
anything like it you ought to give your wife a 
what are we to do with her she is like 
a mad woman when you are away doesn see anything 
doesn remember anything she went on repeating her usual phrases 
 anna she added to her companion  what a 
box for cards my son has brought us  the 
and was delighted with her dress material  though pierre 
natasha nicholas countess mary and had much to talk about 
that they could not discuss before the old countess that 
anything was from her but because she had dropped so 
far in many things that had they to converse in 
her presence they would have had to answer questions and 
to what they had already told her many times that 
so was dead and so was married which she would 
again be unable to remember they sat at tea round 
the samovar in the drawing room from habit and pierre 
answered the countess questions as to whether prince vasili had 
aged and whether countess mary had sent greetings and still 
thought of them and other matters that interested no one 
and to which she herself was indifferent  conversation of 
this kind interesting to no one yet continued all through 
all the grown members of the family were assembled near 
the round tea table at which sonya beside the samovar 
the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea 
and their voices were audible from the next room at 
tea all sat in their accustomed places nicholas beside the 
at a small table where his tea was to him 
the old gray  of the first with a quite 
gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent 
than ever lay on the armchair beside him whose curly 
hair mustache and had turned half gray sat beside countess 
mary with his general pierre sat between his wife and 
the old countess he spoke of what he knew might 
interest the old lady and that she could understand he 
told her of social and of the people who had 
formed the circle of her and had once been a 
real living and distinct group but who were now for 
the most part about the world and like herself were 
the last ears of the they had in earlier years 
but to the old countess those of hers seemed to 
be the only serious and real society natasha saw by 
pierre animation that his visit had been interesting and that 
he had much to tell them but not say it 
before the old countess not being a member of the 
family did not understand pierre and being as a much 
interested in what was in petersburg kept pierre to tell 
them about what had happened in the regiment then about 
and then about the society once or twice pierre was 
carried away and began to speak of these things but 
nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health 
of prince and countess mary   and all this 
and asked  that still going on   on 
pierre exclaimed  more than ever the society is the 
whole government now    is that mon cher 
asked the countess who had finished her tea and evidently 
a pretext for being angry after her  are you 
saying about the government i don understand   you 
know nicholas interposed knowing how to things into his mother 
language  alexander golitsyn has a society and in has 
great influence they say   and golitsyn remarked pierre 
 now the whole government and what a government they 
see everywhere and are afraid of everything   and 
how is prince alexander to he is a most man 
i used to meet him at mary said the countess 
in an offended tone and still more offended that they 
all remained silent she went on  everyone finds a 
society well and what is there in that and she 
rose  else got up too and with a severe 
expression back to her table in the sitting room  
the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds 
of the children voices and laughter from the next room 
evidently some excitement was going on there   finished 
little natasha rose above them all  pierre exchanged glances 
with countess mary and nicholas  he never lost sight 
of and smiled   delightful music said he  
 means that anna has finished her said countess mary 
  i go and see said pierre up  
know he added stopping at the door  i especially 
fond of that music it is always the first thing 
that tells me all is well when i was here 
today the nearer i got to the house the more 
anxious i grew as i entered the anteroom i heard 
of laughter and that meant that all was well  
 know i know that feeling said nicholas  i 
go there stockings are to be a surprise for me 
 pierre went to the children and the shouting and 
laughter grew still louder   anna pierre voice was 
heard saying  here into the middle of the room 
and at the word of command  two and when 
i say  you stand here and you in my 
arms now one two said pierre and a silence followed 
 and a cry of children voices filled the room 
 two they shouted  this meant two stockings which 
by a secret process known only to herself anna used 
to at the same time on the same and which 
when they were ready she always drew one out of 
the other in the children presence     
 chapter xiv   soon after this the children 
came in to say good night they kissed everyone the 
tutors and governesses made their bows and they went out 
only young nicholas and his tutor remained whispered to the 
boy to come downstairs   monsieur i will ask 
my aunt to let me stay replied nicholas bolkonski also 
in a whisper   please let me stay said 
he going up to his aunt  his face expressed 
entreaty agitation and countess mary glanced at him and turned 
to pierre   you are here he can tear 
himself away she said   will bring him to 
you monsieur good night said pierre giving his hand to 
the tutor and he turned to young nicholas with a 
smile  and i haven seen anything of one another 
yet how like he is growing mary he added addressing 
countess mary   my father asked the boy flushing 
crimson and looking up at pierre with bright ecstatic eyes 
 pierre nodded and went on with what he had 
been saying when the children had interrupted countess mary sat 
down doing natasha did not take her eyes off her 
husband nicholas and rose asked for their pipes smoked went 
to more tea from sonya sat weary but resolute at 
the samovar pierre the curly delicate boy sat with shining 
eyes in a corner starting every now and then and 
muttering something to himself and evidently experiencing a new and 
powerful as he turned his curly head with his thin 
neck exposed by his turn collar toward the place where 
pierre sat  the conversation turned on the gossip about 
those in power in which most people see the chief 
interest of home politics dissatisfied with the government on account 
of his own in the service heard with pleasure of 
the things done in petersburg which seemed to him stupid 
and made and sharp on what pierre told them  
 used to have to be a german one must 
dance with and madame and and the oh they should 
let that fine fellow bonaparte lose all this nonsense out 
of them fancy giving the command of the semenov to 
a fellow like that he cried  nicholas though free 
from to find with everything also thought that of the 
government was a very serious and matter and the fact 
that a had been appointed of this and general of 
that and that the emperor had said so and this 
so seemed to him very important and so he thought 
it necessary to take an interest in these things and 
to question pierre the questions put by these two kept 
the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about 
the higher government  but natasha knowing all her husband 
and ideas saw that he had long been wishing but 
had been unable to the conversation to another channel and 
express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of 
which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his 
new friend prince and she helped him by asking how 
his affairs with prince had gone   was it 
about asked nicholas   the same thing said pierre 
looking round at his  that things are going so 
badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so 
and that it is the duty of all men to 
it as far as they can   can men 
do nicholas inquired frowning slightly  can be done  
 this   into my study said nicholas  
natasha who had long expected to be to nurse her 
baby now heard the nurse calling her and went to 
the nursery countess mary followed her the men went into 
the study and little nicholas bolkonski followed them by his 
uncle and sat down at the table in a corner 
by the window   what would you do asked 
  some said nicholas   this began pierre 
not sitting down but pacing the room sometimes stopping short 
gesticulating and  position in petersburg is this the emperor 
does not look into anything he has himself to this 
 could not in anyone now  seeks only for 
peace and only these people  can give it him 
who at and everything and you will agree that if 
you did not look after your estates yourself but only 
wanted a quiet life the your was the more your 
object might be he said to nicholas    
    without faith or law   
 what does that lead up to said nicholas  
 everything is going to robbery in the law in 
the army nothing but and military the people are is 
suppressed all that is young and is everyone that this 
cannot go on everything is strained to such a degree 
that it will certainly break said pierre  those who 
the actions of any government have always said since began 
 told them just one thing in petersburg   
whom   you know whom said pierre with a 
meaning glance from under his brows  and all those 
to culture and is all very well of course the 
aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else 
is  at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of 
his his face and he went up to the boy 
  are you here   let him be 
said pierre taking nicholas by the arm and continuing  
is not enough i told them something else is when 
you stand expecting the string to at any moment when 
everyone is expecting the as many as possible must join 
hands as as they can to the general everything that 
is young and strong is being away and one is 
by women another by a third by or money and 
they go over to that no men such as you 
or i are left what i say is the of 
our society let the d be not alone but and 
as well  nicholas who had left his pushed up 
an armchair sat down in it and listened to pierre 
and frowning more and more   with what aim 
he cried  what position will you toward the government 
  the position of the society need not be 
secret if the government it not merely is it not 
to government but it is a society of true society 
of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word it 
is only to prevent some or other from my children 
and yours and from sending me off to some military 
we join hands only for the public welfare and the 
general safety   but it a secret society and 
therefore a and one which can only cause   
did the which europe  did not then to that 
russia had europe  any the is an alliance of 
it is love help it is what preached on the 
cross  natasha who had come in during the conversation 
looked joyfully at her husband it was not what he 
was saying that pleased her did not even interest her 
for it seemed to her that was all simple and 
that she had known it a long time  seemed 
so to her because she knew that it from pierre 
whole soul but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance 
that made her glad  the boy with the thin 
neck out from the turn collar everyone had forgotten at 
pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy every word 
of pierre into his heart and with a nervous movement 
of his fingers he broke the and his hands came 
upon on his uncle table   is not at 
all what you suppose but that is what the german 
was and what i am   my the is 
all well for the but i don understand it and 
can even it interposed in a loud and resolute voice 
 that here is and but the i don understand 
if we not satisfied let us have a of our 
own that all je       
   your man   pierre smiled natasha 
began to laugh but nicholas his brows still more and 
began to pierre that there was no prospect of any 
great change and that all the danger he spoke of 
only in his pierre the contrary and as his mental 
were greater and more nicholas felt himself this made him 
still for he was fully convinced not by but by 
something within him than reason of the of his opinion 
  will tell you this he said rising and 
trying with nervously fingers to up his pipe in a 
corner but finally the  can prove it to you 
you say that everything here is and that an is 
coming i don see it but you also say that 
our of is a matter and to that i reply 
 are my best friend as you know but if 
you formed a secret society and began against the government 
it what it may know it is my duty to 
obey the government and if ordered me to lead a 
against you and cut you down i should not an 
instant but should do it and you may about that 
as you like  an awkward silence followed these words 
natasha was the first to speak her husband and her 
brother her defense was weak and but she her object 
the conversation was resumed and no longer in the tone 
of nicholas last remark  when they all got up 
to go in to supper little nicholas bolkonski went up 
to pierre pale and with shining radiant eyes   
pierre you no if papa were would he agree with 
you he asked  and pierre suddenly realized what a 
special and powerful process of thought and feeling must have 
been going on in this boy during that conversation and 
all he had said he that the lad should have 
heard him he had however to give him an answer 
  i think so he said reluctantly and left 
the study  the lad looked down and seemed now 
for the first time to notice what he had done 
to the things on the table he flushed and went 
up to nicholas   forgive me i did that 
he said pointing to the broken and  nicholas started 
angrily   right all right he said the under 
the table  and evidently his vexation with difficulty he 
turned away from the boy   ought not to 
have been here at all he said    
  chapter xv   the conversation at supper 
was not about politics or but turned on the subject 
nicholas liked best of  started these and pierre was 
particularly agreeable and amusing about them the family on the 
most friendly terms  after supper nicholas having in his 
study and given to the who had been waiting for 
him went to the in his gown where he found 
his wife still at her table   are you 
mary nicholas asked  countess mary blushed she was afraid 
that what she was would not be understood or by 
her husband  she had wanted to what she was 
from him but at the same time was glad he 
had surprised her at it and that she would now 
have to tell him   nicholas she replied him 
a blue exercise book filled with her firm bold  
 nicholas repeated with a of irony and he took 
up the book  it was in french   
 today when  eldest boy up he did not 
wish to dress and mademoiselle sent for me he was 
and i tried but he only grew then i took 
the matter in hand i left him alone and began 
with nurse help to get the other children up telling 
him that i did not love him for a long 
time he was silent as if astonished then he jumped 
out of bed ran to me in his shirt and 
sobbed so that i could not calm him for a 
long time it was plain that what him most was 
that he had me afterwards in the evening when i 
gave him his he again began crying and kissing me 
one can do anything with him by tenderness   
 is a  nicholas inquired   have giving 
the elder ones every evening showing how they have behaved 
 nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing 
at him and continued to turn over the and read 
in the was set down everything in the children lives 
that seemed to their mother as showing their or suggesting 
general reflections on they were for the most part quite 
insignificant trifles but did not seem so to the mother 
or to the father either now that he read this 
about his children for the first time  under the 
 was entered   was at table papa said 
he was to have no pudding he had none but 
looked so and at the others while they were i 
think that by children of sweets only their greediness must 
tell nicholas this   nicholas put down the book 
and looked at his wife the radiant eyes gazed at 
him questioningly would he or of her there could be 
no doubt not only of his approval but also of 
his for his wife  perhaps it need not be 
done so thought nicholas or even done at all but 
this continual effort of which the sole aim was the 
children welfare delighted him had nicholas been able to his 
he would have found that his steady tender and proud 
love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder 
at her and at the lofty world almost his reach 
in which she had her being  he was proud 
of her intelligence and goodness recognized his own beside her 
in the world and all the more that she with 
such a soul not only belonged to him but was 
part of himself   quite quite my said he 
with a significant look and after a short pause he 
added  i behaved badly today you weren in the 
study we began and i i lost my but he 
is impossible such a child i don know what would 
become of him if natasha didn keep him in hand 
have you any idea why he went to petersburg they 
have formed   i know said countess mary  
told me   then you know nicholas went on 
growing hot at the mere of their  wanted to 
me that it is every man duty to go against 
the government and that the of and duty i am 
sorry you weren there they all fell on me and 
natasha natasha is absurd how she over him and yet 
there need only be a and she has no words 
of her own but only his added nicholas to that 
which us to judge those and to us he forgot 
that what he was saying about natasha could have been 
word for word to himself in relation to his wife 
  i have noticed that said countess mary  
 i told him that duty and the were above 
everything he started goodness knows what a pity you were 
not there would you have said   i see 
it you were quite right and i told natasha so 
pierre says everybody is suffering and being and that it 
is our duty to help our of course he is 
right there said countess mary  he that we have 
other duties nearer to us duties indicated to us by 
god himself and that though we might ourselves to we 
must not our children   that it that just 
what i said to him put in nicholas who he 
really had said it  they on their own love 
of one and all this in the presence of young 
nicholas who had gone into my study and broke all 
my things   nicholas do you know i am 
often about little nicholas said countess mary  is such 
an exceptional boy i am afraid i him in favor 
of my own we all have children and relations while 
he has no one he is constantly alone with his 
thoughts   i don think you need reproach yourself 
on his account all that the mother could do for 
her son you have done and are doing for him 
and of course i am glad of it he is 
a fine lad a fine lad this evening he listened 
to pierre in a sort of and fancy we were 
going in to supper i looked and he had broken 
everything on my table to and he told me of 
it himself at once i never knew him to tell 
an a fine lad a fine lad repeated nicholas who 
at heart was not fond of nicholas bolkonski but was 
always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad 
  i am not the same as his own 
mother said countess mary  feel i am not the 
same and it me a wonderful boy but i am 
afraid for him it would be good for him to 
have   it won be for long next summer 
i take him to petersburg said nicholas  pierre always 
was a and always will be he continued returning to 
the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him 
 what business is it of mine what goes on 
there is bad and all that what business was it 
of mine when i married and was so deep in 
that i was with and had a mother who could 
not see or understand it and then there are you 
and the children and our affairs is it for my 
own pleasure that i am at the farm or in 
the from morning to night no but i know i 
must work to my mother to you and not to 
leave the children such as i was  countess mary 
wanted to tell him that man does not live by 
alone and that he attached too much importance to these 
matters but she knew she must not say this and 
that it would be to do so she only took 
his hand and kissed it he took this as a 
sign of approval and a of his thoughts and after 
a few minutes continued to think aloud   know 
mary today  was his  back from the and 
told me they are already eighty thousand rubles for the 
forest  and with an eager face nicholas began to 
speak of the of before long and added  ten 
years of life and i shall leave the children in 
an excellent position  countess mary listened to her husband 
and understood all that he told her she knew that 
when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes 
ask her what he had been saying and be vexed 
if he noticed that she had been thinking about something 
else but she had to force herself to attend for 
what he was saying did not interest her at all 
she looked at him and did not think but felt 
about something different she felt a tender love for this 
man who would never understand all that she understood and 
this seemed to make her love for him still and 
added a touch of passionate tenderness besides this feeling which 
her and her from following the of her husband thoughts 
that had no connection with what he was saying through 
her mind she thought of her her husband account of 
the boy agitation while pierre was speaking struck her and 
of his gentle character to her mind and while thinking 
of her she thought also of her own children she 
did not compare them with him but her feeling for 
them with her feeling for him and felt with regret 
that there was something in her feeling for young nicholas 
 sometimes it seemed to her that this difference from 
the difference in their but she felt herself to toward 
him and promised in her heart to do better and 
to the impossible this life to love her husband her 
children little nicholas and all her neighbors as loved mankind 
countess mary soul always toward the the and the absolute 
and could therefore never be at peace a stern expression 
of the lofty secret suffering of a soul by the 
body appeared on her face nicholas gazed at her  
god what will become of us if she as i 
always fear when her face is like that thought he 
and placing himself before the he began to say his 
evening      chapter xvi   
natasha and pierre left alone also began to talk as 
only a husband and wife can talk that is with 
extraordinary and understanding and expressing each other thoughts in contrary 
to all of without or and in a quite peculiar 
way natasha was so used to this kind of talk 
with her husband that for her it was the sign 
of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a 
line of when he began anything or talking and and 
she led on by his example began to do the 
same she knew that they were on the of a 
 from the moment they were alone and natasha came 
up to him with wide happy eyes and quickly his 
head pressed it to her bosom saying  you are 
all mine mine you won escape that moment this conversation 
began contrary to all the of and contrary to them 
because quite different were talked about at one and the 
same time this of many topics did not prevent a 
clear understanding but on the contrary was the sign that 
they fully understood one another  just as in a 
when all is uncertain and except the feeling that the 
so in this intercourse contrary to all of reason the 
words themselves were not and clear but only the feeling 
that them  natasha spoke to pierre about her brother 
life and of how she had and lacked life during 
his own and of how she was than ever of 
mary and how mary was in every way better than 
herself in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging mary 
superiority but at the same time by saying it she 
made a demand on pierre that he should all the 
same her to mary and to all other women and 
that now especially after having seen many women in petersburg 
he should tell her so  pierre answering natasha words 
told her how it had been for him to meet 
ladies at and balls in petersburg   have quite 
lost the of talking to ladies he said  was 
simply dull besides i was very busy  natasha looked 
at him and went on   is so splendid 
she said  she children it is as if she 
saw straight into their yesterday for was   like 
his father he is pierre interjected  natasha knew why 
he mentioned to nicholas the of his with his brother 
was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought 
of it   has the weakness of never with 
anything not generally but i understand that you value what 
up a fresh line said she repeating words pierre had 
once uttered   the chief point is that to 
nicholas ideas and are an a said pierre  he 
is collecting a library and has made it a rule 
not to buy a new book till he has read 
what he had already and and he added with a 
smile  know how much i he began to down 
what he had said but natasha interrupted him to show 
that this was unnecessary   you say ideas are 
an to him   and for me nothing else 
is serious all the time in petersburg i saw everyone 
as in a when i am taken up by a 
thought all else is mere   i so sorry 
i there when you met the children said natasha  
was most delighted i sure   pierre replied and 
went on with what was in his mind  says 
we ought not to think but i can help it 
besides when i was in petersburg i felt  can 
say this to you that the whole affair would go 
to without me was pulling his own way but i 
succeeded in them all and then my idea is so 
clear and simple you see i don say that we 
ought to this and that we may be mistaken what 
i say is  hands you who love the right 
and let there be but one of active prince is 
a fine fellow and clever  natasha would have had 
no doubt as to the greatness of pierre idea but 
one thing disconcerted her  a man so important and 
necessary to society be also my husband how did this 
happen she wished to express this doubt to him  
who could decide whether he is really than all the 
others she asked herself and passed in all those whom 
pierre most respected by what he had said there was 
no one he had respected so highly as   
you know what i am thinking about she asked  
would he have of you now do you think  
pierre was not at all surprised at this question he 
understood his wife line of thought   he repeated 
and pondered evidently sincerely trying to imagine opinion on the 
subject  would not have understood yet perhaps he would 
  love you natasha suddenly said    
he would not have said pierre after  he would 
have of is our family life he was always so 
anxious to find happiness and peace in everything and i 
should have been proud to let him see us there 
now talk of my but you believe what a special 
feeling i have for you after a   i 
should think natasha began   it not that i 
never leave off you and one couldn love more but 
this is something special yes of course he did not 
finish because their eyes meeting said the rest   
nonsense it is natasha suddenly exclaimed  and that the 
greatest happiness is at first on the contrary now is 
the best of all if only you did not go 
away do you remember how we and it was always 
my always mine and what we about don even remember 
  about the same thing said pierre with a 
smile    say it i can bear it 
natasha cried and her eyes coldly and  you see 
her she added after a pause   and if 
i had i have recognized her  they were silent 
for a while   do you know while you 
were talking in the study i was looking at you 
natasha began evidently anxious to the cloud that had come 
over them  are as like him as two the 
boy  meant her little son  it time to 
go to him the milk come but i sorry to 
leave you  they were silent for a few then 
suddenly turning to one another at the same time they 
both began to speak pierre began with self and enthusiasm 
natasha with a quiet happy smile having interrupted one another 
they both stopped to let the other continue   
what did you say go on go on   
you go on i was talking nonsense said natasha  
pierre finished what he had it was the to his 
complacent reflections on his success in petersburg at that moment 
it seemed to him that he was to give a 
new direction to the whole of russian society and to 
the whole world   only wished to say that 
ideas that have great are always simple ones my whole 
idea is that if people are and a power then 
must do the same now that simple enough   
  what were you going to say   
only nonsense   all the same   nothing 
only a said natasha smilingly still more  only wanted 
to tell you about petya today nurse was coming to 
take him from me and he laughed his eyes and 
clung to me i sure he thought he was hiding 
sweet there now he crying well good and she left 
the room   meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonski 
a little was burning as usual  boy was afraid 
of the dark and they could not him of it 
up on four and his nose sounds of little nicholas 
who had just up in a cold sat up in 
bed and gazed before him with wide eyes he had 
from a terrible he had that he and uncle pierre 
wearing such as were in his were leading a huge 
army the army was made up of white lines that 
filled the air like the that about in and which 
called de la in front was glory which was to 
those but rather he and pierre were along lightly and 
joyously nearer and nearer to their goal suddenly the that 
moved them began to and become and it grew difficult 
to move and uncle nicholas stood before them in a 
stern and threatening attitude   you done this he 
said pointing to some broken and  loved you but 
i have orders from and will kill the first of 
you who forward little nicholas turned to look at pierre 
but pierre was no longer there in his place was 
his father andrew his father had neither shape nor form 
but he and when little nicholas him he grew faint 
with love he felt himself powerless and his father and 
pitied him but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to 
them seized young nicholas and he   father he 
thought  there were two good of prince andrew in 
the house nicholas never imagined him in human form  
father has been with me and me he of me 
and of uncle pierre he may tell me i will 
do it his hand why should not the same sort 
of thing happen to me i know they want me 
to learn and i will learn but i shall have 
finished learning and then i will do something i only 
god that something may happen to me such as happened 
to men and i will act as they did i 
will do better everyone shall know me love me and 
be delighted with me and suddenly his bosom heaved with 
and he began to cry   you ill he 
heard voice asking   answered nicholas and lay back 
on his   is good and kind and i 
am fond of him he thought of  uncle pierre 
oh what a wonderful man he is and my father 
oh father father yes i will do something with which 
even he would be satisfied      
second      chapter i   
history is the life of nations and of to seize 
and put into words to describe the life of or 
even of a single nation impossible  the all employed 
one and the same method to describe and seize the 
apparently life of a people they described the of who 
the people and regarded the of those men as the 
of the whole nation  the question how did make 
nations act as they wished and by what was the 
will of these themselves the met by a which the 
nations to the will of a man and the will 
of that man so as to that were  for 
the these questions were solved by a in the direct 
of the in human affairs  modern history in theory 
both these  it would seem that having the of 
the in man to the and in a aim toward 
which nations are led modern history should study not the 
of power but the causes that produce it but modern 
history has not done this having in theory the held 
by the it still follows them in practice  instead 
of men with and by the will of god modern 
history has given us either with extraordinary or simply men 
of very kinds from to who lead the instead of 
the former appointed of the or nations which regarded as 
the progress of modern history has its own welfare of 
the french german or english people or in its highest 
the welfare and of in general by which is usually 
meant that of the occupying a small of a large 
 modern history has the of the without them by 
a new and the of the situation has the after 
they had apparently the of the and the  of 
the to reach the same by another road that is 
to recognize  nations by men and  the of 
a known aim to which these nations and at large 
are  at the of the of all the modern 
from to despite their and the apparent of their lie 
those two old  in the first place the the 
of who in his opinion have  considers only and 
ministers as being such men while another also learned men 
and it is assumed that the goal toward which is 
being led is known to the to one of them 
this goal is the greatness of the or french to 
another it is liberty equality and a certain kind of 
of a small corner of the world called europe  
in  a in paris it and is expressed by 
a movement of from west to east several times it 
and with a from the east in  it its 
extreme moscow and then with a from east to west 
to it as the first movement had done the nations 
of middle europe the movement the starting point of the 
first movement in the west  during that twenty period 
an immense number of were left were trade changed its 
direction millions of men were or were and millions of 
christian men the law of love of their fellows one 
another  what does all this mean why did it 
happen what made those people burn and their fellow men 
what were the causes of these what force made men 
act so these are the plain and most questions asks 
itself when it the and of that period  for 
a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind 
to the science of history whose aim is to nations 
and to know themselves  if history had retained the 
of the it would have said that god to reward 
or his people gave napoleon power and his will to 
the fulfillment of the and that reply would have been 
clear and complete one might believe or in the of 
napoleon but for anyone in it there would have been 
nothing unintelligible in the history of that period nor would 
there have been any  but modern history cannot give 
that reply science does not admit the of the as 
to the direct of the in human affairs and therefore 
history ought to give other  modern history to these 
questions says you want to know what this movement means 
what it and what force produced these then listen  
 xiv was a very proud and self man he 
had such and such and such and such ministers and 
he france badly his were weak men and they too 
france badly and they had such and such and such 
and such moreover certain men wrote some at that time 
at the end of the century there were a of 
men in paris who began to talk about all men 
being free and equal this people all over france to 
begin to at and one another they killed the king 
and many other people at that time there was in 
france a man of he conquered everybody everywhere is he 
killed many people because he was a great and for 
some reason he went to kill and killed them so 
well and was so and that when he returned to 
france he ordered everybody to obey him and they all 
him having become an emperor he again went out to 
kill people in austria and prussia and there too he 
killed a great many in russia there was an emperor 
alexander who decided to restore order in europe and therefore 
fought against napoleon in  he suddenly made friends with 
him but in  they again and again began many 
people napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and 
captured moscow then he suddenly ran away from moscow and 
the emperor alexander helped by the advice of and others 
europe to arm against the of its peace all napoleon 
suddenly became his and their forces against the fresh forces 
he raised the napoleon entered paris forced napoleon to and 
sent him to the island of not him of the 
of emperor and showing him every respect though five years 
before and one year later they all regarded him as 
an and a then louis xviii who till then had 
been the both of the french and the began to 
and napoleon tears before his old guards the throne and 
went into exile then the and  who managed to 
sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and 
the of france talked in vienna and by these conversations 
made the nations happy or unhappy suddenly the and nearly 
and were on the point of again their to kill 
one another but just then napoleon arrived in france with 
a and the french who had been him immediately all 
to him but the were angry at this and went 
to fight the french once more and they the napoleon 
and suddenly him as a sent him to the island 
of st and the exile from the france so dear 
to his heart died a death on that rock and 
his great to but in europe a occurred and the 
sovereigns once again all began to their  it would 
be a mistake to think that this is of the 
accounts on the contrary it is a very expression of 
the not meeting the questions which all the give from 
the of and the of separate to the of general 
and the new of the culture of that period  
the and of these from the fact that modern history 
like a man questions no one has asked  if 
the purpose of history be to give a description of 
the movement of and of the the first question the 
of a reply to which all the rest will be 
what is the power that to this modern history either 
that napoleon was a great or that louis xiv was 
very proud or that certain wrote certain  all that 
may be so and mankind is ready to agree with 
it but it is not what was asked all that 
would be interesting if we recognized a power on itself 
and always its nations through louis and but we do 
not such a power and therefore before speaking about louis 
and we ought to be shown the connection between these 
men and the movement of the nations  if instead 
of a power some other force has appeared it should 
be explained in what this new force for the whole 
interest of history lies precisely in that force  history 
seems to that this force is self and known to 
everyone but in spite of every desire to regard it 
as known anyone reading many cannot help whether this new 
force so understood by the themselves is really quite well 
known to everybody      chapter ii 
  what force the nations  and of separate 
nations understand this force as a power in and in 
their occur solely by the will of a napoleon and 
alexander or in general of the persons they describe the 
given by this kind of to the question of what 
force causes to happen are only as long as there 
is but one to each as soon as of different 
and begin to describe the same the they give immediately 
lose all meaning for this force is understood by them 
all not only differently but often in quite one says 
that an was produced by napoleon power another that it 
was produced by alexander a third that it was to 
the power of some other person besides this of that 
kind each other even in their statement as to the 
force on which the of some particular person was a 
says that napoleon power was on his and a says 
it was on his and of the people so the 
of this class by one another positions the understanding of 
the force which and no reply to history essential question 
 of history who deal with all the nations seem 
to recognize how is the of the force which they 
do not recognize it as a power in and but 
as the of a of forces in a war or 
the of a people a general looks for the cause 
of the not in the power of one man but 
in the of many persons connected with the  to 
this the power of as the of many forces can 
no longer it would seem be regarded as a force 
that itself yet in most still the of power as 
a force that itself and treat it as their cause 
in their an character is first the of his time 
and his power only the of forces and then his 
power is itself a force and others for at one 
time prove napoleon to be a of the revolution of 
the ideas of  and so and at another plainly 
say that the of  and other things they do 
not like were simply the of napoleon will and that 
the very ideas of  were in their by napoleon 
the ideas of the revolution and the general of the 
age produced napoleon power but napoleon power suppressed the ideas 
of the revolution and the general of the age  
this is not not only does it occur at every 
step but the accounts are all made up of a 
chain of such this because after entering the field of 
the stop halfway  to find forces equal to the 
or force the sum of the must equal the this 
condition is never observed by the and so to explain 
the forces they are to admit in addition to the 
another force the  the of  or the of 
the bourbons plainly that these were produced by the will 
of alexander but the this opinion of the to prove 
that the of  and the of the bourbons were 
to other things beside alexander will as the of madame 
de and others the evidently alexander power into the and 
the rest the sum of the that is the of 
madame de and the others evidently does not equal the 
the of millions of to the bourbons that madame de 
and others spoke certain words to one another only affected 
their relations but does not account for the of millions 
and therefore to explain how from these relations of the 
of millions of people is how forces equal to one 
a gave a equal to a thousand times a is 
again to fall back on power force he had to 
recognize it as the of the forces that is he 
has to admit an force on the and that is 
just what the do and they not only the but 
themselves  having no clear idea of the cause of 
rain say to whether they want rain or fine weather 
 wind has the away or  wind has brought 
up the and in the same way the sometimes when 
it them and fits in with their theory say that 
power is the result of and sometimes when they want 
to prove something else say that power  a third 
class of so of culture the path laid down by 
the who sometimes accept and ladies as forces take that 
force to be something quite different they see it in 
what is called culture mental  the of culture are 
quite in regard to their the of for if may 
be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one 
another in such and such why not explain them by 
the fact that such and such people wrote such and 
such of the immense number of every these the indication 
of intellectual and say that this indication is the cause 
but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of 
lies in intellectual only by a great can one admit 
that there is any connection between intellectual and the movement 
of and in no case can one admit that intellectual 
people actions for that is not by such as the 
very cruel of the french revolution resulting from the of 
the equality of man or the very cruel wars and 
executions resulting from the of love  but even admitting 
as correct all the with which these are filled that 
nations are by some force called an idea essential question 
still remains and to the former power of and to 
the influence of and other people introduced by the another 
force idea added the connection of which with the it 
is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so 
occurred with some effort one may even that napoleon together 
with other was the cause of an but how a 
book le contrat social had the effect of making begin 
to one another cannot be understood without an of the 
of this new force with the  some relation between 
all who live and so it is possible to find 
some connection between the intellectual of men and their movements 
just as such a connection may be found between the 
movements of and or anything else you please but why 
intellectual is considered by the of culture to be the 
cause or expression of the whole movement is hard to 
understand only the following can have led the to such 
a  that history is written by learned men and 
so it is natural and agreeable for them to think 
that the of their class the of the movement of 
all just as a is natural and agreeable to and 
soldiers  they do not express it that is merely 
because and soldiers do not write history and  that 
culture ideas are all indistinct under whose it is very 
easy to use words having a still less definite meaning 
and which can therefore be introduced into any theory  
but not to speak of the of of this kind 
 may possibly even be of use to someone for 
something the of culture to which all general more and 
more to are significant from the fact that after seriously 
and and political as causes of as soon as they 
have to describe an such as the of  for 
they describe it as resulting from an exercise of power 
say plainly that that was the result of napoleon will 
speaking so the of culture themselves and show that the 
new force they have does not account for what happens 
in history and that history can only be explained by 
a power which they apparently do not recognize   
   chapter iii   a is moving 
someone asks  it a says the devil it another 
man says the because its wheels go round a third 
that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke 
which the wind away  the is he has a 
complete to him someone would have to prove to him 
that there is no devil or another would have to 
explain to him that it is not the devil but 
a german who the only then as a result of 
the will they see that they are both wrong but 
the man who says that the movement of the wheels 
is the cause himself for having once to he ought 
to go on and explain further why the wheels go 
round and till he has reached the cause of the 
movement of the in the pressure of in the he 
has no right to stop in his search for the 
cause the man who explains the movement of the by 
the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the 
wheels do not supply an and has taken the first 
sign that to him and in his turn has offered 
that as an  the only that can explain the 
movement of the is that of a force with the 
movement observed  the only that can explain the movement 
of the is that of some force with the whole 
movement of the  yet to supply this take forces 
of different kinds all of which are with the movement 
observed some see it as a force in as the 
the devil in the others as a force resulting from 
several other forces like the movement of the wheels others 
again as an intellectual influence like the smoke that is 
away  so long as are written of separate whether 
or and not the of all absolutely all those who 
take part in an it is quite impossible to describe 
the movement of without the of a force men to 
direct their toward a certain end and the only such 
known to is that of power  this is the 
one handle by means of which the material of history 
as at present can be with and anyone who that 
handle off as did without finding some other method of 
treating material merely deprives himself of the one possible way 
of with it the necessity of the of power as 
an of is best by the and of culture themselves 
for they that but have to it at every step 
 in with inquiry the science of history up to 
now is like money in money and the and special 
are like paper money they can be used and can 
and fulfill their purpose without to anyone and even as 
long as no one asks what is the behind them 
you need only forget to ask how the will of 
and such as will be interesting and and may perhaps 
even a of but just as of the real value 
of paper money either because being easy to make too 
much of it gets made or because people try to 
it for gold so also the real value of such 
either because too many of them are written or because 
in his of heart someone by what force did napoleon 
do this is wants to the current paper money for 
the real gold of  the of and of the 
history of culture are like people who the of paper 
money decide to for it money made of metal that 
has not the gravity of gold it may indeed make 
but will do no more than that paper money may 
the but is by of base metal that have no 
value but merely as gold is gold only if it 
is not merely for but also for use so will 
be only when they can reply to history essential question 
what is power the give to that question while the 
of culture it and answer something quite different and as 
of gold can be used only among a group of 
people who agree to accept them as gold or among 
those who do not know the nature of gold so 
and of culture not answering essential question serve as for 
some of their own only in and among the of 
who have a taste for what they call  reading 
     chapter iv   having 
the of the as to the of the will of 
a nation to some man and the of that man 
will to the history cannot without take a single step 
till it has one of two things either a return 
to the former in the direct of the in human 
affairs or a definite of the meaning of the force 
and   a return to the first is impossible 
the has been destroyed and so it is essential to 
explain what is meant by power  napoleon ordered an 
army to be raised and go to war we are 
so accustomed to that idea and have become so used 
to it that the question why did six hundred thousand 
men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words seems 
to us he had the power and so what he 
ordered was done  this reply is quite if we 
believe that the power was given him by god but 
as soon as we do not admit that it essential 
to what is this power of one man over others 
 it cannot be the direct power of a strong 
man over a weak one on the or threat of 
force like the power of hercules nor can it be 
on the effect of force as in their some think 
who say that the leading in history are that is 
men with a special strength of soul and mind called 
this power cannot be on the of strength for not 
to mention such as napoleon about whose qualities opinions widely 
history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a 
who over millions of people had any particular qualities but 
on the contrary were generally morally than any of the 
millions they over  if the of power lies neither 
in the nor in the qualities of him who it 
it must evidently be looked for the relation to the 
people of the man who the power  and that 
is how power is understood by the science of that 
bank of history which to history understanding of power for 
true gold  power is the will of the people 
transferred by expressed or consent to their  in the 
of which of of how a state and power might 
be arranged were it possible for all that to be 
arranged it is all very clear but when to history 
that of power  the science of the state and 
power as the regarded fire as something absolutely but for 
history the state and power are merely just as for 
modern fire is not an but a  from this 
difference between the held by history and that held by 
it follows that can tell how in its opinion power 
should be and what power outside time but to history 
questions about the meaning of the of power in time 
it can answer nothing  if power be the will 
of the people transferred to their was a of the 
will of the people if not then why was napoleon 
i why was napoleon iii a when he was taken 
at boulogne and why later on were those whom he 
 do which sometimes only two or three people take 
part the will of the people to a new in 
relations is the will of the people also transferred to 
their was the will of the of the transferred to 
napoleon in  was the will of the russian people 
transferred to napoleon in  when our army in alliance 
with the french went to fight the  to these 
questions three are possible  either to  that the 
will of the people is always transferred to the or 
they have and that therefore every of a new power 
every against the power once appointed should be absolutely regarded 
as an of the real power or  that the 
will of the people is transferred to the under definite 
and known and to show that all and even of 
power result from a by the of the under which 
their power was to them or  that the will 
of the people is to the but that the are 
and and that the appearance of several their and their 
result solely from the greater or fulfillment by the of 
these on which the will of the people is transferred 
from some people to others  and these are the 
three in which the do explain the relation of the 
people to their  some and already to their to 
understand the question of the meaning of power seem to 
consider that the will of the people is transferred to 
persons and therefore when some single state they that particular 
power to be the one absolute and real power and 
that any other force this is not a power but 
a of power violence  their theory for and of 
history has the to and in the life of nations 
during which and with one another a will prove that 
the the and bonaparte were mere of the true power 
while a and a will prove the one that the 
and the other that the empire was the real power 
and that all the others were of power evidently the 
by these being can only young children  the of 
this of history another set of say that power on 
a of the will of the people to their and 
that have power only on carrying out the program that 
the will of the people has by to them but 
what this program in these do not say or if 
they do they continually one another  each to his 
of what constitutes a nation progress looks for these in 
the greatness wealth freedom or of of france or some 
other country but not to mention the as to the 
nature of this program even admitting that some one general 
program of these of history almost always that theory if 
the under which power is in the wealth freedom and 
of the people how is it that louis xiv and 
the terrible end their while louis xvi and i are 
by their people to this question reply that louis xiv 
contrary to the program on louis xvi but why did 
it not on louis xiv or on louis xv should 
it just on louis xvi and what is the time 
for such to these questions there are and can be 
no little does this explain why for several the will 
is not from certain and their and then suddenly during 
a period of fifty years is transferred to the to 
the to napoleon to alexander to louis xviii to napoleon 
again to x to louis to a government and to 
napoleon iii when explaining these of the people will from 
one to another especially in of relations and alliances the 
are to admit that some of these are not of 
the people will but are on on on or on 
the weakness of a diplomatist a or a party so 
that the greater part of the of history wars and 
by these not as the of free of the people 
will but as of the ill will of one or 
more that is once again as of power and so 
these also see and admit which are to the theory 
 these a who having noticed that some plants grow 
from seeds two should that all that does so by 
into two leaves and that the palm the and even 
the oak which into full and no longer two leaves 
are from the theory  of the third class that 
the will of the people is transferred to but that 
the are to us they say that have power only 
because they fulfill the will of the people which has 
been to them  but in that case if the 
force that nations lies not in the but in the 
nations themselves what have those  the these tell us 
express the will of the people the of the the 
of the people  but in that case the question 
whether all the of the serves as an expression of 
the people will or only some part of it if 
the whole of the serves as the expression of the 
people will as some suppose then all the of the 
court scandals in the of a napoleon or a catherine 
serve to express the life of the nation which is 
evident nonsense but if it is only some particular side 
of the of an which serves to express the people 
life as other so  believe then to which side 
of the of a the nation life we have first 
of all to know in what the nation life  
met by this difficulty of that class some most and 
general which can all and this to be the aim 
of movement the most usual adopted by almost all the 
are freedom equality progress and culture some as the goal 
of the movement of the study the men of whom 
the greatest number of have remained ministers and to the 
to which in their opinion these persons have or that 
but as it is in no way that the aim 
of does in freedom equality or and as the connection 
of the people with the and of is only on 
the that the will of the people is always transferred 
to the men whom we have noticed it happens that 
the of the millions who burn and one another never 
is expressed in the account of the of some people 
who did not burn practice or their fellow  history 
this at every turn is the of the of the 
west at the end of the century and their drive 
explained by the of louis xiv xv and xvi their 
and ministers and by the lives of napoleon and others 
 is the movement of the russian people to and 
expressed by of the morbid character of the terrible and 
by his with  is the movement of the at 
the time of the explained by the life and of 
the and the louis and their ladies for us that 
movement of the from west to east without with a 
crowd of and with peter the remains and yet more 
is the of that movement when a and aim for 
the of been clearly by and the to free the 
land but the people did not go for the cause 
which had them to go no longer the history of 
the and the can evidently not the life of the 
and the history of the and the has remained the 
history of and but the history of the life of 
the and their has remained  still less does the 
history of and explain to us the life of the 
 the history of culture explains to us the and 
of life and thought of a or a we learn 
that had a hot and said such and such things 
we learn that was and wrote such and such but 
we do not learn why after the the one another 
nor why during the french revolution they one another  
if we both these kinds of history as is done 
by the we shall have the history of and but 
not the history of the life of the   
   chapter v   the life of 
the nations is not in the lives of a few 
men for the connection between those men and the nations 
has not been found the theory that this connection is 
on the of the will of a people to certain 
is an by the experience of history  the theory 
of the of the will of the people to persons 
may perhaps explain much in the of and be essential 
for its but in its to history as soon as 
or civil wars occur is as soon as history theory 
explains nothing  the theory seems just because the act 
of of the people will cannot be for it never 
occurred  happens and whoever may stand at the head 
of affairs the theory can always say that such and 
such a person took the lead because the will was 
transferred to him  the this theory gives to questions 
are like the of a man who watching the movements 
of a of cattle and paying no attention to the 
of the in different of the field or to the 
of the should the direction the takes to what animal 
happens to be at its head   goes in 
that direction because the animal in front leads it and 
the will of all the other is in that this 
is what of the first class say who the of 
the people will   the leading the change this 
happens because the will of all the is transferred from 
one to another to whether the animal is or is 
not leading them in the direction by the whole such 
is the reply who that the will of the people 
is to under which they regard as known  this 
method of observation it often happens that the by the 
direction he himself those as who to the people change 
of direction are no longer in front but on one 
side or even in the   the in front 
are continually changing and the direction of the whole is 
constantly altered this is because in order to follow a 
given direction the their will to the that have our 
attention and to study the movements of the we must 
watch the movements of all the prominent moving on all 
sides of the so say the third class of who 
regard all persons from to as the expression of their 
age  the theory of the of the will of 
the people to persons is merely a of the question 
in other words  what causes power what is power 
power is the will of the people transferred to one 
person under what condition is the will of the people 
to one person on condition that that person the will 
of the whole people that is power is power in 
other words power is a word the meaning of which 
we do not understand   if the of human 
knowledge were to abstract then having to the of  
that science gives us would that power is merely a 
word and has no real but to understand man has 
besides abstract experience by which he his reflections and experience 
tells us that power is not merely a word but 
an  not to speak of the fact that no 
description of the of men can do without the of 
power the of power is both by history and by 
 whenever an a man or men appear by whose 
will the seems to have taken place napoleon iii a 
and the french go to the king of prussia and 
and an army napoleon i a and an army russia 
alexander i gives a command and the french to the 
bourbons experience shows us that it is always related to 
the will of one or of several men who have 
it  the in accord with the old habit of 
acknowledging in human affairs want to see the cause of 
in the expression of the will of someone with power 
but that is not either by reason or by experience 
 on the one side shows that the expression of 
a man will words only part of the general expressed 
in an as for in a war or a revolution 
and so without assuming an force cannot admit that words 
can be the cause of the movements of millions of 
men on the other hand even if we that words 
could be the cause of history shows that the expression 
of the will of does not in most produce any 
effect that is to say their commands are often not 
and sometimes the very opposite of what they order  
without admitting in the affairs of we cannot regard  
as the cause of  power from the of experience 
is merely the relation that between the expression of someone 
will and the execution of that will by others  
to explain the of that we must first establish a 
of the expression of will referring it to man and 
not to the  if the a command his will 
as history tells us the expression of that will is 
of time and is not by anything for the is 
not by an but speaking of commands that are the 
expression of the will of men in time and in 
relation to one another to explain the connection of commands 
with we must restore  the condition of all that 
takes place the of movement in time both of the 
and of the person who commands and  the of 
the connection between the person and those who his command 
     chapter vi   only 
the expression of the will of the not on time 
can to a whole of over a period of years 
or and only the of everything can by his sole 
will the direction of movement but man acts in time 
and himself takes part in what  the first condition 
that of time we see that no command can be 
without some order having been given the execution of the 
last command possible  no command ever or itself a 
whole of but each command follows from another and never 
to a whole of but always to one moment only 
of an  when for we say that napoleon ordered 
to go to war we in one expression a whole 
of commands one on another napoleon could not have an 
of russia and never did so today he ordered such 
and such papers to be written to vienna to and 
to petersburg tomorrow such and such and orders to the 
army the the and so on and so on of 
commands which formed a whole to a of which brought 
the french into russia  if his napoleon gave commands 
an of england and on no other so much time 
and effort and yet during his whole never once to 
that design but an expedition into russia with which country 
he considered it to be in alliance  conviction he 
expressed came about because his commands did not to the 
course of in the first case but did so in 
the latter  for an order to be certainly it 
is necessary that a man should order what can be 
but to know what can and what cannot be is 
impossible not only in the case of napoleon of russia 
in which millions but even in the simplest for in 
either case millions of may to prevent its execution every 
order is always one of an immense number all the 
impossible orders with the course of remain only the possible 
ones get up with a of commands to a of 
and are  our that an is by a command 
which it is to the fact that when the has 
taken place and out of thousands of others those few 
commands which were with that have been we forget about 
the others that were not because they could not be 
apart from that the chief of our in this matter 
is to the fact that in the accounts a whole 
of and such for as all those which led the 
french to russia is into one in accord with the 
result produced by that of and with this the whole 
of commands is also into a single expression of will 
 we say that napoleon wished to russia and it 
in in all napoleon we never find anything an expression 
of that wish but find a of orders or expressions 
of his will very and amid a long of orders 
of napoleon one for the of  was carried out 
because those orders differed in any way from the other 
orders but because they with the course of that led 
the french army into russia just as in work this 
or that figure comes out not because the color was 
laid on from this side or in that way but 
because it was laid on from all sides over the 
figure cut in the  so that the relation in 
time of the commands to the we find that a 
command can never be the cause of the but that 
a certain definite between the two  to understand in 
what this it is necessary to another condition of every 
command not from the but from a man which is 
that the man who gives the command himself takes part 
in the  this relation of the commander to those 
he commands is just what is called power this relation 
in the following  for common people always in certain 
in which of the difference of the set for the 
common the relation between those taking part in it is 
always the same  men in these always such relations 
toward one another that the larger number take a more 
direct and the number a less direct in the for 
which they have  of all the in which men 
for one of the most striking and definite is an 
army  every army is of lower of the service 
rank and whom there are always the greatest number of 
the next higher military rank and officers of whom there 
are and of still officers of whom there are still 
and so on to the highest military command which is 
concentrated in one person  a military may be quite 
to a of which the base with the of the 
rank and the next higher and section of the of 
the next higher of the army and so on to 
the the point of which will represent the commander in 
chief  the soldiers of whom there are the most 
form the lower section of the and its base the 
himself does the burning and and always orders for these 
actions from men above him he himself never gives an 
order the officers  whom there are perform the itself 
less frequently than the soldiers but they already give commands 
an officer still less often acts himself but commands still 
more frequently a general does nothing but command the indicates 
the and hardly ever a himself the commander in chief 
never takes direct part in the itself but only gives 
general orders the movement of the of the a relation 
of people to one another is seen in every of 
men for common trade and every  and so without 
particularly all the of a and of the ranks of 
an army or the ranks and positions in any or 
public business from the lowest to the highest we see 
a law by which men to take in such relations 
that the more they in the the less they can 
command and the more they are while the less their 
direct in the itself the more they command and the 
of them there are rising in this way from the 
lowest ranks to the man at the top who takes 
the least direct in the and his chiefly to  
this relation of the men who command to those they 
command is what constitutes the of the called power  
having restored the condition of time under which all occur 
we find that a command is only when it is 
related to a of the essential condition of relation between 
those who command and those who we find that by 
the very nature of the case those who command take 
the part in the itself and that their is to 
     chapter vii   when 
an is taking place people express their opinions and wishes 
about it and as the from the of many people 
some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure 
to be if but when one of the opinions expressed 
is that opinion gets connected with the as a command 
it  men are a each of them his opinion 
as to how and where to it they the away 
and it happens that this is done as one of 
them said he ordered it there we have command and 
power in their form the man who worked most with 
his hands could not think so much about what he 
was doing or on or command what would result from 
the common while the man who more would evidently work 
less with his hands on account of his greater  
when some larger of men direct their to a common 
aim there is a yet of those who because their 
is given to and take less part in the direct 
work  when a man alone he always has a 
certain set of reflections which as it seems to him 
his past justify his present and him in planning his 
future actions just the same is done by a of 
people allowing those who do not take a direct part 
in the to and surmises their  for reasons known 
or to us the french began to and kill one 
another and to the its in people that this was 
necessary for the welfare of france for liberty and for 
equality people ceased to kill one another and this was 
accompanied by its in the necessity for a of power 
to europe and so on men went from the west 
to the east their fellow men and the was accompanied 
by phrases about the glory of france the of england 
and so on history shows us that these of the 
have no common sense and are all as in the 
case of a man as the result of his rights 
and the of millions in russia for the humiliation of 
england but these have a very necessary in their own 
day  these release those who produce the from responsibility 
these are like the fixed in front of a to 
clear the snow from the in front they clear men 
from their path  without such there would be no 
reply to the simplest question that itself when each how 
is it that millions of men commit war commit murder 
and so on  with the present of political and 
social life in europe can any that is not or 
ordered by ministers or be imagined is there any which 
cannot find its in political in in the balance of 
power or in so that every that with some expressed 
wish and receiving a itself as the result of the 
will of one man or of several men  in 
direction a ship the flow of the waves it will 
always be of it to those on board the ship 
the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible 
motion  only by watching moment by moment the movement 
of that flow and it with the movement of the 
ship do we ourselves that every bit of it is 
by the forward movement of the ship and that we 
were led into by the fact that we ourselves were 
moving  we see the same if we watch moment 
by moment the movement of  is the condition of 
all that of movement in time and do not lose 
sight of the essential connection of persons with the  
when the ship in one direction there is one and 
the same of it when it frequently the of it 
also frequently but wherever it may turn there always will 
be the its movement  happens it always that just 
that was and wherever the ship may go the rush 
of water which neither nor its movement of it and 
at a distance seems to us not merely to move 
of itself but to the ship movement also   
only those expressions of the will of persons which as 
commands were related to have assumed that the on those 
commands but the themselves and the connection in which the 
persons stood to the people we have found that they 
and their orders were on the of this is that 
however many commands were the does not take place unless 
there are other causes for it but as soon as 
an it what it may out of all the continually 
expressed wishes of different people some will always be found 
which by their meaning and their time of are related 
as commands to the  at this we can reply 
and to these two essential questions of history   
what is power   what force the movement of 
the nations   power is the relation of a 
given person to other in which the more this person 
opinions and of the that is performed the less is 
his in that   the movement of nations is 
not by power nor by intellectual nor even by a 
of the two as have but by the of all 
the people who in the and who always in such 
a way that those taking the direct in the take 
on themselves the least responsibility and  morally the of 
power to cause the physically it is those who to 
the power but as the is without the the cause 
of the is neither in the one nor in the 
other but in the of the two  or in 
other words the of a cause is to the we 
are  in the last we reach the circle of 
final to which in every of thought man reason if 
it is not playing with the subject heat heat attract 
each other and one another  speaking of the of 
heat and and of we cannot say why this and 
we say that it is so because it is because 
it must be so and that it is a law 
the same to why war and revolution occur we do 
not know we only know that to produce the one 
or the other people in a certain in which they 
all take part and we say that this is so 
because it is or in other words that it is 
a law      chapter viii  
 if history only with the of this simple and 
obvious law would and we should have finished our but 
the law of history to man a of matter cannot 
tell us that it does not feel the law of 
or and that that law is but man who is 
the subject of history says plainly i am free and 
am therefore not subject to the law  the presence 
of the problem of man free will though is felt 
at every step of history  all seriously thinking have 
this question all the and of history and the path 
science has followed are solely to the lack of a 
of that question  if the will of every man 
were free that is if each man could act as 
he pleased all history would be a of  if 
in a thousand years even one man in a million 
could act that is as he chose it is evident 
that one single free act of that man in of 
the human would the of the of any for the 
whole of  if there be a single law the 
actions of men free will cannot exist for then man 
will is subject to that law  in this lies 
the problem of free will which from most times has 
occupied the best human minds and from most times has 
been in its whole tremendous  the problem is that 
regarding man as a subject of observation from point of 
or find a general law of necessity to which he 
 all that is subject but regarding him from within 
ourselves as what we are conscious of we feel ourselves 
to be free  this consciousness is a of self 
quite apart from and of reason through his reason man 
himself but only through consciousness does he know himself  
apart from consciousness of self no observation or of reason 
is  to understand observe and draw man must first 
of all be conscious of himself as living a man 
is only conscious of himself as a living being by 
the fact that he that is is conscious of his 
but his will the of his life recognizes  can 
but recognize as free  if himself man that his 
will is always by one and the same law  
he the necessity of taking food using his or anything 
else he cannot recognize this never direction of his will 
than as a of it were it not free it 
could not be a man will seems to him to 
be just because he is not conscious of it except 
as free  you say i am not free but 
i have lifted my hand and let it fall everyone 
that this reply is an of freedom  that reply 
is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject 
to reason  if the consciousness of freedom were not 
a separate and of self it would be subject to 
and to experience but in fact such does not exist 
and is  a of and to every man that 
he as an object of observation is subject to certain 
and man to them and never the of gravity or 
once he has become acquainted with them but the same 
of and to him that the complete freedom of which 
he is conscious in himself is impossible and that his 
every depends on his his character and the upon him 
yet man never to the of these and having learned 
from experiment and that a stone downwards a man this 
and always expects the law that he has learned to 
be  but learning just as certainly that his will 
is subject to he does not and cannot believe this 
 however often experiment and may show a man that 
under the same and with the same character he will 
do the same thing as before yet when under the 
same and with the same character he for the time 
the that always in the same way he as certainly 
convinced as before the experiment that he can act as 
he every man or however reason and experiment may prove 
to him that it is impossible to imagine two different 
of in precisely the same that without this  constitutes 
the of freedom he cannot imagine life he that however 
impossible it may be it is so for without this 
of freedom not only would he be unable to understand 
life but he would be unable to live for a 
single moment  he could not live because all man 
all his to life are only to increase freedom wealth 
and poverty and power and strength and weakness health and 
culture and work and and and are only greater or 
of freedom  a man having no freedom cannot be 
of except as of life  if the of freedom 
to reason to be a like the of two actions 
at one and the same instant of time or of 
an effect without a cause that only that consciousness is 
not subject to reason  this consciousness of freedom by 
experiment or recognized by all and felt by everyone without 
exception this consciousness without which no of man is possible 
constitutes the other side of the question  man is 
the of an all all and all god what is 
sin the of which from the consciousness of man freedom 
that is a question for  the actions of men 
are subject to general expressed in what is man responsibility 
to society the of which from the of freedom that 
is a question for  man actions from his character 
and the upon him what is conscience and the perception 
of right and wrong in actions that follows from the 
consciousness of freedom that is a question for  man 
in connection with the general life of subject to which 
that life but the same man apart from that connection 
to be free how should the past life of nations 
and of be regarded the result of the free or 
as the result of the of man that is a 
question for history  only in our self day of 
the of knowledge to that most powerful engine of the 
of matter the question of the freedom of will been 
put on a on which the question itself cannot exist 
in our time the of so people is the crowd 
of taken the work of the who deal with one 
side of the question for a of the whole problem 
 they say and write and that the soul and 
freedom do not exist for the life of man is 
expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are by the 
of the the soul and free will do not exist 
because at an period of time we from the they 
say this not at all that thousands of years ago 
that same law of necessity which with such they are 
now trying to prove by and was not merely by 
all the and all the but has never been they 
do not see that the role of the natural in 
this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for 
the of one side of it for the fact that 
from the point of of observation reason and the will 
are merely of the and that man following the general 
law may have developed from lower at some period of 
time only explains from a fresh side the truth thousands 
of years ago by all the and from the point 
of of reason man is subject to the law of 
necessity but it does not by a hair the of 
the question which has another opposite side on the consciousness 
of freedom  if men from the at an period 
of time that is as as that they were made 
from a of earth at a certain period of time 
 the first case the is the time in the 
second case it is the and the question of how 
man consciousness of freedom is to be with the law 
of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved 
by and for in a a or an we can 
observe only the muscular nervous but in man we observe 
consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous  the 
and their thinking they can solve this question are like 
set to one side of the of a who availing 
themselves of the of the chief of the work should 
in an of over the and still and should be 
delighted that from their point of as everything is now 
so and regular      chapter ix 
  for the of the question of free will 
or history has this over other branches of knowledge in 
which the question is with that for history this question 
does not to the of man free will but its 
in the past and under certain  in regard to 
this question history to the other as science to abstract 
science  the subject for history is not man will 
itself but our of it  and so for history 
the by the of free will and does not exist 
as it does for and history a of man life 
in which the of these two has already taken place 
 in life each each human is very clearly and 
understood without any sense of although each itself as free 
and  to solve the question of how freedom and 
necessity are and what constitutes the of these two the 
of history can and should follow a path contrary to 
that taken by other instead of first the of freedom 
and in themselves and then the of life under those 
history should a of the of freedom and themselves from 
the immense of of which it is and that always 
appear on these two elements  of the of many 
men or of an we may consider we always regard 
it as the result of man free will and of 
the law of  whether we speak of the of 
the and the of the or of the of napoleon 
iii or of someone an hour ago in choosing one 
direction out of several for his walk we are of 
any the degree of freedom and the actions of these 
people is clearly for us  our of the degree 
of freedom often to in the point of from which 
we regard the but every human to us as a 
certain of freedom and in every we we see a 
certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of and 
always the more freedom we see in any the less 
do we and the more the less freedom  the 
proportion of freedom to and to the point of from 
which the is regarded but their relation is always one 
of proportion  a man who at another and him 
or a mother exhausted by her baby who some food 
or a man to who on duty at the word 
of command a man less guilty that is less free 
and more subject to the law of necessity to one 
who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed 
and more free to one who does not know that 
the man was himself that the mother was that the 
was in the ranks and so on a man who 
committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived 
and in society seems less guilty and his more to 
the law of to someone who considers his after twenty 
years have elapsed than to one who examined it the 
day after it was committed and in the same way 
every of an or highly man less free and more 
to one who knows the mental condition of him who 
committed the and seems more free and less to one 
who does not know it in all these the of 
freedom is or and the of is or to the 
point of from which the is regarded so that the 
greater the of necessity the the of freedom and  
the common sense of mankind the science of and history 
itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom  
all without exception in which our of freedom and necessity 
is and on three   the relation to the 
world of the man who the   his relation 
to time   his relation to the causes leading 
to the  the first consideration is the of our 
perception of the man relation to the world and the 
greater or of our understanding of the definite position occupied 
by the man in relation to everything with him this 
is what makes it evident that a man is less 
free and more subject to necessity than one standing on 
dry ground and that makes the actions of a man 
connected with others in a or of one by family 
official or business duties seem certainly less free and more 
subject to necessity than those of a man living in 
and  if we consider a man alone apart from 
his relation to everything around him each of his seems 
to us free but if we see his relation to 
anything around him if we see his connection with anything 
a man who to him a book he the work 
on which he is engaged even with the air he 
or the light that on the things about him see 
that each of these circumstances has an influence on him 
and at least some side of his and the more 
we of these the more our of his freedom and 
the more our of the necessity that weighs on him 
 the second consideration is the more or less evident 
time relation of the man to the world and the 
of our perception of the place the man in time 
that is the ground which makes the fall of the 
first man resulting in the of the human race appear 
evidently less free than a man into today it is 
the reason why the life and of people who lived 
ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem 
to me as free as the life of a the 
of which are still to me  the degree of 
our of freedom or depends in this respect on the 
greater or of time between the of the and our 
of it  if i an act i performed a 
moment ago in the same circumstances as those i am 
in now my to me free but if i an 
act performed a month ago then being in different circumstances 
i cannot help that if that act had not been 
committed much that from it agreeable and even essential not 
have taken place if i on an still more ten 
years ago or more then the of my are still 
to me and i find it hard to imagine what 
would have happened had that not been performed the farther 
i go back in memory or what is the same 
thing the farther i go forward in my the more 
doubtful my in the freedom of my  in history 
we find a very progress of conviction the part played 
by free will in the general affairs of a seems 
to us to be the doing of all the known 
but with a more we already see its which prevent 
our considering anything else possible and the farther we go 
back in the less do they appear  the war 
to us the result of the conduct of and so 
on the wars still seem to us though already to 
be the of their will but in the we already 
see an occupying its definite place in history and without 
which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe though 
to the of the that appeared as merely to the 
will of certain people in regard to the of the 
it does not enter anyone head today to suppose that 
the of the world on the farther back in history 
the object of our observation lies the more doubtful does 
the free will of those concerned in the become and 
the more the law of  the third consideration is 
the degree to which we that chain of demanded by 
reason in which each and therefore man every must have 
its definite place as a result of what has gone 
before and as a cause of what will follow  
the better we are acquainted with the and by observation 
and by which man is and the more we the 
and causes of the and the the we are and 
the less the character and mind of the man in 
question the more subject to and the less free do 
our actions and those of others appear  when we 
do not at all understand the cause of an whether 
a a good or even one that is simply we 
a greater amount of freedom to it in the case 
of a we most demand the for such an act 
in the case of a virtuous act we rate its 
most highly in an indifferent case we recognize in it 
more and but if even one of the causes of 
the act is known to us we recognize a certain 
of necessity and are less on for the or the 
of the of the virtuous act or the freedom of 
the apparently that a was among male factors his in 
our eyes the self of a father or mother or 
self with the of a reward is more than self 
and therefore seems less of sympathy and less the result 
of free will the of a or party or an 
us less when we know how or by what the 
way was prepared for his if we have a large 
of if our observation is constantly to the of cause 
and effect in people actions their actions appear to us 
more under and less free the more we the with 
the causes if we examined simple actions and had a 
number of such actions under observation our of their would 
be still greater the conduct of the son of a 
father the of a woman who had into bad company 
a into and so on are actions that seem to 
us less free the better we understand their cause if 
the man whose actions we are considering is on a 
very low of mental like a child a or a 
knowing the causes of the act and the of the 
character and intelligence in question we see so large an 
of necessity and so little free will that as soon 
as we know the cause the we can the result 
 on these three alone is the of for and 
the circumstances by all the responsibility greater or less to 
our greater or knowledge of the circumstances in which the 
man was placed whose is being and to the greater 
or of time between the of the and its and 
to the greater or understanding of the causes that led 
to the      chapter x  
 thus our of free will and gradually or to 
the greater or connection with the world the greater or 
of time and the greater or on the causes in 
relation to which we a man life  so that 
if we the case of a man whose connection with 
the world is well known where the time between the 
and its is great and where the causes of the 
are most we get the of a of and a 
of free will if we a man little on whose 
was performed very recently and the causes of whose are 
our we get the of a of and a of 
freedom  in neither case we may change our point 
of however plain we may make to ourselves the connection 
between the man and the world however it may be 
to us however long or short the period of time 
however or the causes of the may be we ever 
either complete freedom or complete necessity   to degree 
we may imagine a man to be from the influence 
of the world we never get a of freedom in 
space every human is by what him and by his 
own body i lift my arm and let it fall 
my seems to me free but asking myself whether i 
could my arm in every direction i see that i 
raised it in the direction in which there was least 
to that either from things around me or from the 
of my own body i chose one out of all 
the possible directions because in it there were for my 
to be free it was necessary that it should no 
to of a man being free we must imagine him 
outside space which is evidently impossible   however much 
we the time of to the time of the deed 
we never get a of freedom in time for if 
i an committed a second ago i must still recognize 
it as not being free for it is to the 
moment at which it was committed can i lift my 
arm i lift it but ask myself could i have 
from lifting my arm at the moment that has already 
passed to myself of this i do not lift it 
the next moment but i am not now from doing 
so at the first moment when i asked the question 
time has gone by which i could not the arm 
i then lifted is no longer the same as the 
arm i now refrain from lifting nor is the air 
in which i lifted it the same that now me 
the moment in which the first movement was made is 
irrevocable and at that moment i could make only one 
movement and movement i made would be the only one 
that i did not lift my arm a moment later 
does not prove that i could have from lifting it 
then and since i could make only one movement at 
that single moment of time it could not have been 
any other to imagine it as free it is necessary 
to imagine it in the present on the between the 
past and the future is outside time which is impossible 
  however much the difficulty of understanding the causes 
may be we never reach a of complete freedom that 
is an of cause however to us may be the 
cause of the expression of will in any our own 
or another the first demand of reason is the of 
and search for a cause for without a cause no 
is i my arm to perform an of any cause 
but my wish to perform an without a cause is 
the cause of my  but even if a man 
quite from all only his momentary in the present by 
any cause were to admit so small a of as 
we should even then not have arrived at the of 
complete freedom in man for a being by the world 
standing outside of time and of cause is no longer 
a man  in the same way we can never 
imagine the of a man quite of freedom and entirely 
subject to the law of   however we may 
increase our knowledge of the of space in which man 
is that knowledge can never be complete for the number 
of those is as as the of space and therefore 
so long as not all the men are there is 
no complete but a certain measure of freedom remains  
 however we may the period of time between the 
we are and the upon it that period will be 
while time is and so in this respect too there 
can never be absolute   however may be the 
chain of of any we shall never know the whole 
chain since it is and so again we never reach 
absolute  but besides this even if admitting the remaining 
of freedom to equal we assumed in some given case 
for in that of a dying man an or an 
idiot of freedom by so doing we should the very 
of man in the case we are for as soon 
as there is no freedom there is also no man 
and so the of the of a man subject solely 
to the law of without any of freedom is just 
as impossible as the of a man completely free  
and so to imagine the of a man entirely subject 
to the law of without any freedom we must the 
knowledge of an number of space relations an long period 
of time and an of causes  to imagine a 
man perfectly free and not subject to the law of 
we must imagine him all alone space time and free 
from on cause  in the first case if were 
possible without freedom we should have reached a of by 
the of itself that is a mere form without  
in the second case if freedom were possible without we 
should have arrived at freedom space time and cause which 
by the fact of its being and would be nothing 
or mere without form  we should in fact have 
reached those two of which man whole on the is 
of life and the that  reason says  space 
with all the of matter that give it is and 
cannot be imagined  time is motion without a moment 
of rest and is  the connection between cause and 
effect has no beginning and can have no end  
consciousness says  i alone am and all that is 
but me i include space  i measure time by 
the fixed moment of the present in which alone i 
am conscious of myself as living i am outside time 
 i am cause for i feel myself to be 
the cause of every of my life  reason gives 
expression to the of consciousness gives expression to the of 
freedom  freedom not by anything is the of life 
in man consciousness without is man reason in its three 
 freedom is the thing examined is what freedom is 
the is the form  only by the two of 
related to one another as form to do we get 
the and separately of freedom and  only by them 
do we get a clear of man life  apart 
from these two which in their one another as form 
and no of life is possible  all that we 
know of the life of man is merely a certain 
relation of free will to that is of consciousness to 
the of reason  all that we know of the 
world of nature is only a certain relation of the 
forces of nature to or of the of life to 
the of reason  the great natural forces lie outside 
us and we are not conscious of them we call 
those forces animal force and so on but we are 
conscious of the force of life in man and we 
call that freedom  but just as the force of 
in itself but felt by every man is understood by 
us only to the to which we know the of 
to which it is subject  the first knowledge that 
all have weight up to law so too the force 
of free will in itself but of which everyone is 
conscious is to us only in as far as we 
know the of to which it is subject  the 
fact that every man up to the knowledge of the 
most and  all knowledge is merely a bringing of 
this of life under the of reason  man free 
will from every other force in that man is conscious 
of it but in the eyes of reason it in 
no way from any other force the forces of or 
are only distinguished from one another in that they are 
differently by reason just so the force of man free 
will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of 
nature only by the reason gives it freedom apart from 
necessity that is apart from the of reason that it 
in no way from or heat or the force that 
makes things grow for reason it is only a momentary 
of life  and as the of the force moving 
the heavenly the of the forces of heat and or 
of or of the force the of and so on 
just in the same way does the force of free 
will form the of history but just as the subject 
of every science is the of this of life while 
that itself can only be the subject of even the 
of the force of free will in human in space 
in time and in on cause the subject of history 
while free will itself is the subject of  in 
the what we know we call the of what is 
to us we call force force is only an expression 
for the over and above what we know of the 
of life  so also in history what is known 
to us we call of what is we call free 
will free will is for history only an expression for 
the of what we know about the of human life 
     chapter xi   history 
the of man free will in connection with the world 
in time and in on cause that is it this 
freedom by the of reason and so history is a 
science only in so far as this free will is 
by those  the of man free will as something 
capable of that is as not subject to is the 
same for history as the of a free force moving 
the heavenly would be for  that would the of 
the of that is of any science if there is 
even a single body moving then the of and are 
and no of the movement of the heavenly any longer 
if any single is to free will then not a 
single law can exist nor any of  for history 
lines exist of the movement of human one end of 
which is in the but at the other end of 
which a consciousness of man will in the present in 
space time and on cause  the more this field 
of motion out before our eyes the more evident are 
the of that movement to and those is the problem 
of history  from the from which the science of 
history now its subject on the path it now follows 
the causes of in man a of those is impossible 
for however man free will may be as soon as 
we recognize it as a force not subject to law 
the of law impossible  only by this of free 
will to the that is by regarding it as an 
small can we ourselves of the absolute of the causes 
and then instead of causes history will take the of 
as its problem  the search for these has long 
been and the new of thought which history must are 
being worked out with the self toward which and the 
causes of old method of history is moving  all 
human have along that path at the most of the 
process of and on the new process of the of 
small the of cause seeks law that is the property 
common to all small elements  in another form but 
along the same path of the other have when the 
law of gravity he did not say that the sun 
or the earth had a property of he said that 
all from the to the have the property of one 
another that is leaving aside the question of the cause 
of the movement of the he expressed the property common 
to all from the large to the small the same 
is done by the natural leaving aside the question of 
cause they for history on the same path and if 
history has for its object the study of the movement 
of the nations and of and not the of in 
the lives of it too setting aside the of cause 
should the common to all the elements of free will 
     chapter xii   from 
the time the law of was discovered and the mere 
of the fact that it was not the sun but 
the earth that to the whole of the by that 
law it might have been possible to the old of 
the movements of the but without it it would seem 
impossible to continue the but even after the of the 
law of the were still studied for a long time 
 from the time the first person said and that 
the number of or of is subject to and that 
this or that of government is determined by certain and 
and that certain relations of to soil produce of the 
foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in 
their  by these new the former of history might 
have been retained but without them it would seem impossible 
to continue as the of man free will for if 
a certain of government was or certain of took place 
in of such and such or then the free will 
of those who appear to us to have that of 
government or the can no longer be regarded as the 
cause  and yet the former history to be studied 
side by side with the of political and which its 
 the between the old views and the new was 
long and fought out in stood on for the old 
views and the new of but when truth conquered itself 
just as firmly on the new  just as and 
is the now between the old and the new of 
history and in the same way on for the old 
and the new of  in the one case as 
in the other on both sides the and truth on 
the one hand there is fear and regret for the 
of the whole through the on the other is the 
for  to the men who fought against the rising 
of it seemed that if they that truth it would
